# Methodologies and MR Parameters in Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Neurography: A Scoping Review

This repository contains the search queries and search results of our scoping review on methodologies and MR parameters in quantitative mangnetic resonance neurography. The scoping review has been registered in the Open Science Framework, see [https://osf.io/9p3zm](https://osf.io/9p3zm).

## Search Queries
The [queries directory](queries) contains the search queries for the literature search in the four databases databases MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (Ovid), Web of Science, and Scopus.

## Search Results
The [search directory](search) contains the results of the literature search in the databases. The literature search was executed on 25th June 2021. As PUBMED and Web of Science do not support exportation to the RIS or Endnote XML formats required for the import into the study selection software Covidence, we converted the NBIB and BIB to RIS using Medeley Desktop version 1.19.8.

A second literature search will be executed at the end of the scoping review to identify any recently published studies for potential inclusion.
