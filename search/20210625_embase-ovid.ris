N2  - BACKGROUND: Clinicoradiologic differentiation between benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) has important management implications. OBJECTIVE(S): To develop and evaluate machine-learning approaches to differentiate benign from malignant PNSTs. METHOD(S): We identified PNSTs treated at 3 institutions and extracted high-dimensional radiomics features from gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Training and test sets were selected randomly in a 70:30 ratio. A total of 900 image features were automatically extracted using the PyRadiomics package from Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline. Clinical data including age, sex, neurogenetic syndrome presence, spontaneous pain, and motor deficit were also incorporated. Features were selected using sparse regression analysis and retained features were further refined by gradient boost modeling to optimize the area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosis. We evaluated the performance of radiomics-based classifiers with and without clinical features and compared performance against human readers. RESULT(S): A total of 95 malignant and 171 benign PNSTs were included. The final classifier model included 21 imaging and clinical features. Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.676, 0.882, and 0.845, respectively, were achieved on the test set. Using imaging and clinical features, human experts collectively achieved sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.786, 0.431, and 0.624, respectively. The AUC of the classifier was statistically better than expert humans (P = .002). Expert humans were not statistically better than the no-information rate, whereas the classifier was (P = .001). CONCLUSION(S): Radiomics-based machine learning using routine MRI sequences and clinical features can aid in evaluation of PNSTs. Further improvement may be achieved by incorporating additional imaging sequences and clinical variables into future models.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2021.

N2  - Functional and structural brain alterations have been noted in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), the most common entrapment peripheral neuropathy. Previous studies were mainly focused on somatosensory cortices. However, the changes of white matter diffusion properties in nonsensorimotor cortices remain uninvestigated. We utilized a modified tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) pipeline to explore CTS-related white matter plasticity, omitting the skeletonization step and registering diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data to a study-specific, high resolution T1 template by an optimized registration method. The modified TBSS was demonstrated to be more sensitive to detect changes in white matter integrity than the standard TBSS approach. In this study, 25 moderate/severe CTS patients and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were evaluated with DTI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) were calculated for group comparison. And the relationship between diffusion parameters and clinical assessments was also analyzed. Comparing with the healthy controls, CTS patients showed significantly increased FA and decreased RD in areas of multisensory integration and motor control involving the central opercular cortex and supplementary motor area (SMA) of the dominant hemisphere. Moreover, altered diffusion parameters in the central opercular cortex of the dominant hemisphere were significantly correlated with Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) scores. It is considered to be a form of maladaptive neuroplastic response to CTS-associated afference and motor control deficits. Such insight may be helpful in developing new strategies for the treatment of CTS.Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Context: Although diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is predominantly considered a disorder of the peripheral nerves, some evidence for central nervous system involvement has recently emerged. However, whether or to what extent the microstructure of central somatosensory tracts may be injured remains unknown. Objective(s): This work aimed to detect the microstructure of central somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients and to correlate it with the severity of DPN. Method(s): A case-control study at a tertiary referral hospital took place with 57 individuals with type 2 diabetes (25 with DPN, 32 without DPN) and 33 nondiabetic controls. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of 2 major somatosensory tracts (the spinothalamic tract and its thalamocortical [spino-thalamo-cortical, STC] pathway, the medial lemniscus and its thalamocortical [medial lemnisco-thalamo-cortical, MLTC] pathway) were assessed based on diffusion tensor tractography. Regression models were further applied to detect the association of FA values with the severity of DPN in diabetic patients. Result(s): The mean FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly lower in patients with DPN than those without DPN and controls. Moreover, FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly associated with the severity of DPN (expressed as Toronto Clinical Scoring System values) in patients after adjusting for multiple confounders. Conclusion(s): Our findings demonstrated the axonal degeneration of central somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients with DPN. The parallel disease progression of the intracranial and extracranial somatosensory system merits further attention to the central nerves in diabetic patients with DPN.

N2  - Objective.The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the central nervous system with the rest of the body to regulate many physiological functions and is therapeutically targeted to treat diseases such as epilepsy, depression, intestinal dysmotility, chronic pain, and more. However, we still lack understanding of PNS innervation in most organs because the large span, diffuse nature, and small terminal nerve bundle fibers have precluded whole-organism, high resolution mapping of the PNS. We sought to produce a comprehensive peripheral nerve atlas for use in future interrogation of neural circuitry and selection of targets for neuromodulation.Approach.We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) with high-speed compressed sensing to generate a tractogram of the whole mouse PNS. The tractography generated from the DT-MRI data is validated using lightsheet microscopy on optically cleared, antibody stained tissue.Main results.Herein we demonstrate the first comprehensive PNS tractography in a whole mouse. Using this technique, we scanned the whole mouse in 28 h and mapped PNS innervation and fiber network in multiple organs including heart, lung, liver, kidneys, stomach, intestines, and bladder at 70microm resolution. This whole-body PNS tractography map has provided unparalleled information; for example, it delineates the innervation along the gastrointestinal tract by multiple sacral levels and by the vagal nerves. The map enabled a quantitative tractogram that revealed relative innervation of the major organs by each vertebral foramen as well as the vagus nerve.Significance.This novel high-resolution nerve atlas provides a potential roadmap for future neuromodulation therapies and other investigations into the neural circuits which drive homeostasis and disease throughout the body.Copyright © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Rationale: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a great challenge for regenerative medicine. Nerve autograft is the gold standard for clinical PNI repair. Due to its significant drawbacks, artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) have drawn much attention as replacement therapies. We developed a combinatorial NGC consisting of longitudinally aligned electrospun nanofibers and porcine decellularized nerve matrix hydrogel (pDNM gel). The in vivo capacity for facilitating nerve tissue regeneration and functional recovery was evaluated in a rat sciatic nerve defect model. Method(s): Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) was electrospun into randomly oriented (PLLA-random) and longitudinally aligned (PLLA-aligned) nanofibers. PLLA-aligned were further coated with pDNM gel at concentrations of 0.25% (PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel) and 1% (PLLA-aligned/1% pDNM gel). Axonal extension and Schwann cells migration were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining of dorsal root ganglia cultured on the scaffolds. To fabricate implantable NGCs, the nanofibrous scaffolds were rolled and covered with an electrospun protection tube. The fabricated NGCs were then implanted into a 5 mm sciatic nerve defect model in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Nerves treated with NGCs were compared to contralateral uninjured nerves (control group), injured but untreated nerves (unstitched group), and autografted nerves. Nerve regeneration was monitored by an established set of assays, including T2 values and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histological assessments, and immunostaining. Nerve functional recovery was evaluated by walking track analysis. Result(s): PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel scaffold exhibited the best performance in facilitating directed axonal extension and Schwann cells migration in vitro due to the combined effects of the topological cues provided by the aligned nanofibers and the biochemical cues retained in the pDNM gel. Consistent results were obtained in animal experiments with the fabricated NGCs. Both the T2 and fractional anisotropy values of the PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel group were the closest to those of the autografted group, and returned to normal much faster than those of the other NGCs groups. Histological assessment indicated that the implanted PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel NGC resulted in the largest number of axons and the most extensive myelination among all fabricated NGCs. Further, the PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel group exhibited the highest sciatic nerve function index, which was comparable to that of the autografted group, at 8 weeks post-surgery. Conclusion(s): NGCs composed of aligned PLLA nanofibers decorated with 0.25% pDNM gel provided both topological and biochemical guidance for directing and promoting axonal extension, nerve fiber myelination, and functional recovery. Moreover, T2-mapping and DTI metrics were found to be useful non-invasive monitoring techniques for PNI treatment.Copyright © 2020 The author(s).

N2  - Objectives: To assess the interreader and test-retest reliability of magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry in sciatic nerve MR neurography (MRN). Material(s) and Method(s): In this prospective study, 21 healthy volunteers were examined three times on separate days by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 Tesla, consisting of an MTI sequence, a multi-echo T2 relaxometry sequence, and a high-resolution T2-weighted sequence. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density (PSD) of the sciatic nerve were assessed by two independent observers, and both interreader and test-retest reliability for all readout parameters were reported by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Result(s): For the sciatic nerve, overall mean +/- standard deviation MTR was 26.75 +/- 3.5%, T2 was 64.54 +/- 8.2 ms, and PSD was 340.93 +/- 78.8. ICCs ranged between 0.81 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for interreader reliability and between 0.75 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for test-retest reliability. SEM for interreader reliability was 1.7% for MTR, 2.67 ms for T2, and 21.3 for PSD. SEM for test-retest reliability was 1.7% for MTR, 2.66 ms for T2, and 20.1 for PSD. Conclusion(s): MTI and T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve are reliable and reproducible. The values of measurement imprecision reported here may serve as a guide for correct interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies. Key Points: * Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve are reliable and reproducible. * The imprecision that is unavoidably associated with different scans or different readers can be estimated by the here presented SEM values for the biomarkers T2, PSD, and MTR. * These values may serve as a guide for correct interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies and possible clinical applications.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disease that results in impaired double stranded DNA repair. This leads to both increased susceptibility to various cancers, as well as hypersensitivity to radiotherapy and systemic therapy; thus, increasing the complexity of oncological treatment paradigm. Here, we present an FA patient who initially developed invasive breast cancer for which she received breast conserving treatment with no significant treatment related toxicity. This was followed by a diagnosis of high-grade ductal carcinoma-in-situ in the contralateral breast, which was managed successfully by surgery and meticulously planned adjuvant radiotherapy, with no treatment interruptions.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)

N2  - Purpose: Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the common peripheral neuropathies. For magnetic resonance imaging, segmentation of the carpal tunnel and its contents, including flexor tendons and the median nerve for magnetic resonance images is an important issue. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which was modified by the original DeepLabv3 + model to segment three primary structures of the carpal tunnel: the carpal tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve. Method(s): To extract important feature maps for segmentation of the carpal tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve, the proposed CNN model termed modified DeepLabv3 + uses DenseNet-121 as a backbone and adds dilated convolution to the original spatial pyramid pooling module. A MaskTrack method was used to refine the segmented results generated by modified DeepLabv3 + , which have a small and blurred appearance. For evaluation of the segmentation results, the average Dice similarity coefficients (ADSC) were used as the performance index. Result(s): Sixteen MR images corresponding to different subjects were obtained from the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Our proposed modified DeepLabv3 + generated the following ADSCs: 0.928 for carpal tunnel, 0.872 for flexor tendons and 0.785 for the median nerve. The ADSC value of 0.8053 generated the MaskTrack that 0.22 ADSC measure were improved for measuring the median nerve. Conclusion(s): The experimental results showed that the proposed modified DeepLabv3 + model can promote segmentations of the carpal tunnel and its contents. The results are superior to the results generated by original DeepLabv3 +. Additionally, MaskTrack can also effectively refine median nerve segmentations.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - ABSTRACT: Imaging of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has demonstrated key diffusion tensor imaging-based diffusivity alterations in the trigeminal nerve; however, imaging has primarily focused on the peripheral nerve segment because of previous limitations in reliably segmenting small fiber bundles across multiple subjects. We used Selective Automated Group Integrated Tractography to study 36 subjects with TN (right-sided pain) and 36 sex-matched controls to examine the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve [CN V]), pontine decussation (TPT), and thalamocortical fibers (S1). Gaussian process classifiers were trained by scrolling a moving window over CN V, TPT, and S1 tractography centroids. Fractional anisotropy (FA), generalized FA, radial diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity metrics were evaluated for both groups, analyzing TN vs control groups and affected vs unaffected sides. Classifiers that performed at greater-than-or-equal-to 70% accuracy were included. Gaussian process classifier consistently demonstrated bilateral trigeminal changes, differentiating them from controls with an accuracy of 80%. Affected and unaffected sides could be differentiated from each other with 75% accuracy. Bilateral TPT could be distinguished from controls with at least 85% accuracy. TPT left-right classification achieved 98% accuracy. Bilateral S1 could be differentiated from controls, where the affected S1 radial diffusivity classifier achieved 87% accuracy. This is the first TN study that combines group-wise merged tractography, machine learning classification, and analysis of the complete trigeminal pathways from the peripheral fibers to S1 cortex. This analysis demonstrates that TN is characterized by bilateral abnormalities throughout the trigeminal pathway compared with controls and abnormalities between affected and unaffected sides. This full pathway tractography study of TN demonstrates bilateral changes throughout the trigeminal pathway and changes between affected and unaffected sides.Copyright © 2020 International Association for the Study of Pain.

N2  - ABSTRACT: Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) has been traditionally considered as a pure disorder of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by neuropathic pain and degeneration of small-diameter nerve fibers in the skin. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed abnormal activations of pain networks, but the structural basis underlying such maladaptive functional alterations remains elusive. We applied diffusion tensor imaging to explore the influences of SFN on brain microstructures. Forty-one patients with pathology-proven SFN with reduced skin innervation were recruited. White matter connectivity with the thalamus as the seed was assessed using probabilistic tractography of diffusion tensor imaging. Patients with SFN had reduced thalamic connectivity with the insular cortex and the sensorimotor areas, including the postcentral and precentral gyri. Furthermore, the degree of skin nerve degeneration, measured by intraepidermal nerve fiber density, was associated with the reduction of connectivity between the thalamus and pain-related areas according to different neuropathic pain phenotypes, specifically, the frontal, cingulate, motor, and limbic areas for burning, electrical shocks, tingling, mechanical allodynia, and numbness. Despite altered white matter connectivity, there was no change in white matter integrity assessed with fractional anisotropy. Our findings indicate that alterations in structural connectivity may serve as a biomarker of maladaptive brain plasticity that contributes to neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve degeneration.Copyright © 2020 International Association for the Study of Pain.

N2  - Purpose: AGel amyloidosis is systemic amyloidosis caused by pathogenic variants in the GSN gene. In this study, we sought to characterize the clinical and brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) features of Korean patients with AGel amyloidosis. Material(s) and Method(s): We examined 13 patients with AGel amyloidosis from three unrelated families. Brain MRIs were performed in eight patients and eight age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Therein, we analyzed gray and white matter content using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and FreeSurfer. Result(s): The median age at examination was 73 (interquartile range: 64-76) years. The median age at onset of cutis laxa was 20 (interquartile range: 15-30) years. All patients over that age of 60 years had dysarthria, cutis laxa, dysphagia, and facial palsy. Two patients in their 30s had only mild cutis laxa. The median age at dysarthria onset was 66 (interquartile range: 63.5-70) years. Oph-thalmoparesis was observed in three patients. No patient presented with muscle weakness of the limbs. Axial fluid-attenuated in-version recovery images of the brain showed no significant differences between the patient and control groups. Also, analysis of VBM, TBSS, and FreeSurfer revealed no significant differences in cortical thickness between patients and healthy controls at the corrected significance level. Conclusion(s): Our study outlines the clinical manifestations of prominent bulbar palsy and early-onset cutis laxa in 13 Korean patients with AGel amyloidosis and confirms that AGel amyloidosis mainly affects the peripheral nervous system rather than the central nervous system.Copyright © Yonsei University College of Medicine 2021.

N2  - Background: Detection of peripheral nerve thickening and nerve function impairment is crucial in the diagnosis and the management of leprosy. Aims and objectives: (1) To document the cross-sectional area, echotexture and blood flow of peripheral nerves in healthy controls and leprosy cases using high-resolution ultrasound, (2) to compare the sensitivities of clinical examination and high-resolution ultrasound in detecting peripheral nerve thickening in leprosy. Method(s): Peripheral nerves of 30 leprosy patients and 30 age- and sex-matched controls were evaluated clinically and by high-resolution ultrasound. When the cross-sectional area of a peripheral nerve on high-resolution ultrasound in a leprosy patient was more than the calculated upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for mean for that specific nerve in controls, that particular peripheral nerve was considered to be enlarged. Result(s): Cross-sectional areas more than 7.1 mm2 for the radial nerve, 8.17 mm2 for ulnar, 10.17 mm2 for median, 9.50 mm2 for lateral popliteal and 11.21mm2 for the posterior tibial nerve were considered as nerve thickening on high-resolution ultrasound. High-resolution ultrasound detected 141/300 (47%) nerves enlarged in contrast to the 60 (20%) diagnosed clinically by palpation (P < 0.001). Clinical examination identified thickening in 31/70 (44.3%) nerves in cases with impairment of nerve function and 29/230 (12.6%) in the absence of nerve function impairment. High-resolution ultrasound detected thickening in 50/70 (71.4%) nerves with impairment of function and in 91/230 (39.6%) nerves without any impairment of function. Limitation(s): A single-centre study design was the major study limitation. Conclusion(s): High-resolution ultrasound showed greater sensitivity than clinical examination in detecting peripheral nerve thickening in leprosy cases. High-resolution ultrasound, may therefore improve the sensitivity of the diagnostic criterion of peripheral nerve enlargement in the diagnosis and classification of leprosy.Copyright © 2021 Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology - Published by Scientific Scholar.

N2  - CONTEXT: Although diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is predominantly considered a disorder of the peripheral nerves, some evidence for central nervous system involvement has recently emerged. However, whether or to what extent the microstructure of central somatosensory tracts may be injured remains unknown. OBJECTIVE(S): This work aimed to detect the microstructure of central somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients and to correlate it with the severity of DPN. METHOD(S): A case-control study at a tertiary referral hospital took place with 57 individuals with type 2 diabetes (25 with DPN, 32 without DPN) and 33 nondiabetic controls. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of 2 major somatosensory tracts (the spinothalamic tract and its thalamocortical [spino-thalamo-cortical, STC] pathway, the medial lemniscus and its thalamocortical [medial lemnisco-thalamo-cortical, MLTC] pathway) were assessed based on diffusion tensor tractography. Regression models were further applied to detect the association of FA values with the severity of DPN in diabetic patients. RESULT(S): The mean FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly lower in patients with DPN than those without DPN and controls. Moreover, FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly associated with the severity of DPN (expressed as Toronto Clinical Scoring System values) in patients after adjusting for multiple confounders. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings demonstrated the axonal degeneration of central somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients with DPN. The parallel disease progression of the intracranial and extracranial somatosensory system merits further attention to the central nerves in diabetic patients with DPN.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Background: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is diagnosed through clinical findings and genetic testing. While there are neurophysiological tools and clinical functional scales in CMT, objective disease biomarkers that can facilitate in monitoring disease progression are limited. Purpose(s): To investigate the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in determining the microstructural integrity of sciatic and peroneal nerves and its correlation with the MRI grading of muscle atrophy severity and clinical function in CMT as determined by the CMT neuropathy score (CMTNS). Study Type: Prospective case-control. Subjects: Nine CMT patients and nine age-matched controls. Field Strength/Sequence: 3 T T1-weighted in-/out-of phase spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) and DTI sequences. Assessment: Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) values for sciatic and peroneal nerves were obtained from DTI. Muscle atrophy was graded according to the Goutallier classification using in-/out-of phase SPGRs. DTI parameters and muscle atrophy grades were compared between CMT and controls, and the relationship between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS were assessed. Statistical Tests: The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used to compare DTI parameters between CMT and controls. The relationship between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS were analyzed using the Spearman correlation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of DTI parameters that can differentiate CMT from healthy controls were done. Result(s): There was a significant reduction in FA and increase in RD of both nerves (P < 0.05) in CMT, with significant correlations between FA (negative; P < 0.05) and RD (positive; P < 0.05) with muscle atrophy grade. In the sciatic nerve, there was significant correlation between FA and CMTNS (r = -0.795; P < 0.05). FA and RD could discriminate CMT from controls with high sensitivity (77.8-100%) and specificity (88.9-100%). Data Conclusion(s): There were significant differences of DTI parameters between CMT and controls, with significant correlations between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grade, and CMTNS.

N2  - Facial synkinesis is a troublesome sequelae of facial nerve malfunction. It is difficult to recover from synkinesis, despite improved surgical techniques for isolating the peripheral facial nerve branches. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether long-term dysfunction of motor control can lead to irreversible plasticity-induced structural brain changes. This case-control study thus investigated the structural brain alterations associated with facial synkinesis. The study was conducted at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China. Twenty patients with facial synkinesis (2 male and 18 female, aged 33.35 +/- 6.97 years) and 19 healthy volunteers (2 male and 17 female, aged 33.21 +/- 6.75 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and voxel-based and surface-based morphometry techniques were used to analyze data. There was no significant difference in brain volume between patients with facial synkinesis and healthy volunteers. Patients with facial synkinesis exhibited a significantly reduced cortical thickness in the contralateral superior and inferior temporal gyri and a reduced sulcal depth of the ipsilateral precuneus compared with healthy volunteers. In addition, sulcal depth of the ipsilateral precuneus was negatively correlated with the severity of depression. These findings suggest that there is a structural remodeling of gray matter in patients with facial synkinesis after facial nerve malfunction. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China (approval No. 2017-365-T267) on September 13, 2017, and was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR1800014630) on January 25, 2018.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

N2  - Introduction: In this study, we aimed to determine whether muscle transverse relaxation time (T2) magnetic resonance (MR) mapping results correlate with motor unit loss, as defined by motor unit recruitment patterns on electromyography (EMG). Method(s): EMG and 3-Tesla MRI exams were acquired no more than 31 days apart in subjects referred for peripheral nerve MRI. Two musculoskeletal radiologists qualitatively graded T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequences for severity of muscle edema-like patterns and manually placed regions of interest within muscles to obtain T2 values from T2-mapping sequences. Concordance was calculated between qualitative and quantitative MR grades and EMG recruitment categories (none, discrete, decreased) as well as interobserver agreement for both MR grades. Result(s): Thirty-four muscles (21 abnormal, 13 control) were assessed in 13 subjects (5 females and 8 males; mean age, 46 years) with 14 EMG-MRI pairs. T2-relaxation times were significantly (P <.001) increased in all EMG recruitment categories compared with control muscles. T2 differences were not significant between EMG grades of motor unit recruitment (P =.151-.702). T2 and EMG score concordance was acceptable (Harrell's concordance index [c index]: rater A, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.87; rater B, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-0.91). Qualitative MRI and EMG score concordance was poor to acceptable (c index: rater A, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50-0.79; rater B, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89). T2 values had moderate-to-substantial ability to distinguish between absent vs incomplete (ie, decreased or discrete) motor unit recruitment (c index: rater A, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50-1.00; rater B, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.57-1.00). Discussion(s): Quantitative T2 MR muscle mapping is a promising tool for noninvasive evaluation of the degree of motor unit recruitment loss.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - Background: Axonal loss denervates muscle, leading to an increase of fat accumulation in the muscle. Therefore, fat fraction (FF) in whole limb muscle using MRI has emerged as a monitoring biomarker for axonal loss in patients with peripheral neuropathies. In this study, we are testing whether deep learning-based model can automate quantification of the FF in individual muscles. While individual muscle is smaller with irregular shape, manually segmented muscle MRI images have been accumulated in this lab; and make the deep learning feasible. Purpose(s): To automate segmentation on muscle MRI images through deep learning for quantifying individual muscle FF in patients with peripheral neuropathies. Study Type: Retrospective. Subjects: 24 patients and 19 healthy controls. Field Strength/Sequences: 3T; Interleaved 3D GRE. Assessment: A 3D U-Net model was implemented in segmenting muscle MRI images. This was enabled by leveraging a large set of manually segmented muscle MRI images. B1+ and B1- maps were used to correct image inhomogeneity. Accuracy of the automation was evaluated using Pixel Accuracy (PA), Dice Coefficient (DC) in binary masks; and Bland-Altman and Pearson correlation by comparing FF values between manual and automated methods. Statistical Tests: PA and DC were reported with their median value and standard deviation. Two methods were compared using the +/- 95% confidence intervals (CI) of Bland-Altman analysis and the Pearson's coefficient (r2). Result(s): DC values were from 0.83 +/- 0.17 to 0.98 +/- 0.02 in thigh and from 0.63 +/- 0.18 to 0.96 +/- 0.02 in calf muscles. For FF values, the overall +/- 95% CI and r2 were [0.49, -0.56] and 0.989 in thigh and [0.84, -0.71] and 0.971 in the calf. Data Conclusion(s): Automated results well agreed with the manual results in quantifying FF for individual muscles. This method mitigates the formidable time consumption and intense labor in manual segmentations; and enables the use of individual muscle FF as outcome measures in upcoming longitudinal studies.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Lowering serum cholesterol levels is a well-established treatment for dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, nerve lesions in patients with T2D increase with lower serum cholesterol levels, suggesting that lowering serum cholesterol levels is associated with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in patients with T2D. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether there is an association between serum cholesterol levels and peripheral nerve lesions in patients with T2D with and without DPN. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study was performed from June 1, 2015, to March 31, 2018. Observers were blinded to clinical data. A total of 256 participants were approached, of whom 156 were excluded. A total of 100 participants consented to undergo magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg at the Department of Neuroradiology and clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic assessment at the Department of Endocrinology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. EXPOSURES Quantification of the nerve's diameter and lipid equivalent lesion (LEL) load with a subsequent analysis of all acquired clinical and serologic data with use of 3.0-Tmagnetic resonance neurography of the right leg with 3-dimensional reconstruction of the sciatic nerve. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was lesion load and extension. Secondary outcomes were clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic findings. RESULTS A total of 100 participants with T2D (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [0.9] years; 68 [68.0%] male) participated in the study. The LEL load correlated positively with the nerve's mean cross-sectional area (r = 0.44; P < .001) and the maximum length of a lesion (r = 0.71; P < .001). The LEL load was negatively associated with total serum cholesterol level (r = -0.41; P < .001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = -0.30; P = .006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = -0.33; P = .003), nerve conduction velocities of the tibial (r = -0.33; P = .01) and peroneal (r = -0.51; P < .001) nerves, and nerve conduction amplitudes of the tibial (r = -0.31; P = .02) and peroneal (r = -0.28; P = .03) nerves. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings suggest that lowering serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D and DPN is associated with a higher amount of nerve lesions and declining nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes. These findings may be relevant to emerging therapies that promote an aggressive lowering of serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D.Copyright © 2019 JAMA Network Open.All right reserved.

N2  - Background: Nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy (DN) is assumed to begin in the distal legs with a subsequent progression to hands and arms at later stages. In contrast, recent studies have found that lower limb nerve lesions in DN predominate at the proximal sciatic nerve and that, in the upper limb, nerve functions can be impaired at early stages of DN. Material(s) and Method(s): In this prospective, single-center cross-sectional study, participants underwent diffusion-weighted 3 Tesla magnetic resonance neurography in order to calculate the sciatic nerve's fractional anisotropy (FA), a surrogate parameter for structural nerve integrity. Results were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological assessments of the lower limb and an examination of hand function derived from the Purdue Pegboard Test. Result(s): Overall, 71 patients with diabetes, 11 patients with prediabetes and 25 age-matched control subjects took part in this study. In patients with diabetes, the sciatic nerve's FA showed positive correlations with tibial and peroneal nerve conduction velocities (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and r = 0.56; p < 0.001, respectively), and tibial and peroneal nerve compound motor action potentials (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and r = 0.63; p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the sciatic nerve's FA was correlated with the Pegboard Test results in patients with diabetes (r = 0.52; p < 0.001), prediabetes (r = 0.76; p < 0.001) and in controls (r = 0.79; p = 0.007). Conclusion(s): This study is the first to show that the sciatic nerve's FA is a surrogate marker for functional and electrophysiological parameters of both upper and lower limbs in patients with diabetes and prediabetes, suggesting that nerve damage in these patients is not restricted to the level of the symptomatic limbs but rather affects the entire peripheral nervous system.© Copyright © 2021 Jende, Kender, Mooshage, Groener, Alvarez-Ramos, Kollmer, Juerchott, Hahn, Heiland, Nawroth, Bendszus, Kopf and Kurz.

N2  - Introduction: MR Neurography (MRN) is an advanced imaging modality of peripheral nerves, complimenting electrophysiology in diagnosis of various peripheral nerve disorders. We describe the findings of the brachial and lumbosacral root abnormalities by method of assessing the cross sectional area (CSA) and signal intensity (SI) on MRN in CIDP. Method(s): Patients diagnosed to have CIDP underwent MRN on a 3 T Philips scanner. The 3D TSE STIR 3D NerveVIEW sequence parameters were: FOV-300x400x140mm with a matrix of 252x286x127 with reconstructed voxel dimensions of 0.60x0.60x1.1 mm.TR/TI/TE of 2200/280/185 ms. A compressed sense factor of 4 was used for TA of 4 minutes 58 seconds. Result(s): Eleven patients with clinical and electrophysiological features of CIDP showed prominent plexus thickening and hyperintense signals. The M:F = 9:2. Mean age at presentation was 50.2 (range 30-61 years). Mean values of CSA of brachial and lumbosacral roots at different levels are as follows: C5-31.4 mm2, C6-37.0 mm2, C7-37.5 mm2, C8-38.4 mm2, L3-31.1 mm2, L4-31.6 mm2, L5-33.7 mm2, S1-40.1 mm2. CSA of cervical roots ranged from 31.4 to 38.0 mm2 and that of lumbosacral(LS) roots between 31.1 to 40.1 mm2. Mean SI of brachial nerve roots was 4.721 +/- 100 and of lumbosacral nerve roots was 7.373 +/- 200. Though normal CSA for Indian population is lacking, CSA of brachial and LS nerve roots in our series is significantly higher compared to control values described in a previous reports (mean CSA and mean SI of LS roots for controls were 14.91 +/- 2.36 mm2, 1.155 +/- 0.094), mean CSA for control brachial roots was 3.50 +/- 0.62 mm (Japanese patients). Conclusion(s): MR neurography can be a valuable, complimentary tool in the diagnosis of CIDP depicting features of thickening and signal hyperintensities of roots and plexus. Data of control population in Indian scenario and large scale studies may further aid in establishing role of MRN as a potential diagnostic tool in CIDP.

N2  - Introduction: Sufficient biomarkers for the detection of early or subclinical lesions as well as for therapy monitoring in hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis with polyneuropathy are still missing. We quantified peripheral nerve lesions by analyzing the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR)[1-3] of the sciatic nerve in symptomatic and asymptomatic ATTRv-PNP, and tested its potential as a novel biomarker that indicates macromolecular changes. Method(s): 25 patients with symptomatic ATTRv-PNP, 30 asymptomatic carriers of the mutant transthyretin gene (mutTTR), and 20 age-/sex-matched healthy controls underwent magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) imaging at 3 Tesla. Two axial 3D gradient-echo sequences with and without an off-resonance saturation rapid frequency pulse were conducted at the right distal thigh. Subsequently, we evaluated the MTR and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the sciatic nerve. All symptomatic ATTRv-PNP patients and asymptomatic mutTTR-carriers received detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic examinations including assessment of the Neuropathy Impairment Score of the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL). Result(s): Sciatic nerve MTRs and CSAs reliably differentiated between symptomatic ATTRv-PNP, asymptomatic mutTTR-carriers, and controls. MTR was lower in symptomatic ATTRv-PNP (26.4 +/- 0.7%; P < 0.0001) and in asymptomatic mutTTR-carriers (32.6 +/- 0.8%; P = 0.0005) vs controls (39.4 +/- 2.1%), and was also lower in symptomatic ATTRv-PNP vs asymptomatic mutTTR-carriers (P = 0.0009). The MTR correlated negatively with the NIS-LL, and positively with compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials. Sciatic nerve CSA was higher in symptomatic ATTRv-PNP (34.3 +/- 1.7 mm3) vs asymptomatic mutTTR-carriers (26.0 +/- 1.1 mm3; P = 0.0005), and vs controls (20.4 +/- 1.2 mm3; P < 0.0001). CSA was also higher in asymptomatic mutTTR-carriers vs controls. Conclusion(s): MTR is a novel imaging biomarker that quantifies macromolecular changes in ATTRv amyloidosis, and clearly differentiates between symptomatic ATTRv-PNP patients, asymptomatic mutTTRcarriers, and non-amyloidotic controls. By positively correlating with CMAP and SNAP amplitudes, sciatic nerve MTR sensitively reflects the extent of motor and sensory axonal degeneration.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate whether pretreatment magnetic resonance (MR)-based radiomics nomogram can individualize prediction of perineural invasion (PNI) status in rectal cancer (RC). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 122 RC patients with pathologically confirmed were classified as training cohort (n = 87) and test cohort (n = 35). 180 radiomics features were extracted from all lesions based on oblique axial T2WI TSE images. The dimensionality reduction and feature selection in training cohort were realized by the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. A predictive model combining radiomics features and clinical risk factors (pathological N stage, pathological LVI status) was established by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The performance of the model was assessed based on its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, nomogram, and calibration. Result(s): The developed radiomics nomogram that integrated the radiomics signature and clinical risk factors could provide discrimination in the training and test cohorts. The accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) for assessing PNI status were 0.82, 0.86, respectively, in the training cohort, while they were 0.71 and 0.85 in the test cohort. The goodness-of-fit of the nomogram was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p = 0.52 in training cohort and p = 0.24 in test cohort). Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusion(s): The developed radiomics nomogram might be helpful in the individualized assessment PNI status in patients with RC. This stratification of RC patients according to their PNI status may provide the basis for individualized adjuvant therapy, especially for stage II patients.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Purpose: To determine normative morphological and functional magnetic resonance (MR) neurography values in children and adolescents in correlation to demographic determinants. Method(s): In this study 29 healthy underage subjects (mean age 13.9 years, range 10-17 years) were examined using a standardized MR neurography protocol of the lumbosacral plexus and the right lower extremity at 3T. Volumes of the dorsal root ganglia L3-S2, cross-sectional area of the sciatic and tibial nerves, as well as T2-weighted contrast nerve-muscle ratio and quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) values of the sciatic nerve were obtained and correlated with the demographic parameters sex, age, height and weight. Result(s): While all obtained morphological and functional MR neurography values did not differ between male and female sex, dorsal root ganglia volume, sciatic and tibial nerve cross-sectional area correlated positively with age, height, and weight. The T2-weighted signal of the sciatic nerve was independent of demographic determinants. Negative correlation was found for fractional anisotropy (FA) with age, height, and weight, whereas radial diffusivity (RD) showed a positive correlation only with age. Mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) revealed no correlation with demographic determinants. Conclusion(s): The results of this study suggest that selection of sex-matched controls for further studies assessing peripheral nerve pathologies in underage patients may not be necessary; however, control subjects should be adapted to age, height, and weight of the patient population, especially if assessing dorsal root ganglia volume, nerve cross-sectional area and DTI.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objective: Management of peripheral nerve injuries requires physicians to rely on qualitative measures from patient history, electromyography, and physical exam. Determining a successful nerve repair can take months to years for proximal injuries, and the resulting delays in clinical decision-making can lead to a negative impact on patient outcomes. Early identification of a failed nerve repair could prevent permanent muscle atrophy and loss of function. This study aims to test the feasibility of performing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate injury and recovery following repair of wrist trauma. We hypothesize that DTI provides a noninvasive and reliable assessment of regeneration, which may improve clinical decision-making and alter the clinical course of surgical interventions. Method(s): Clinical and MRI measurements from subjects with traumatic peripheral nerve injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, and healthy control subjects were compared to evaluate the relationship between DTI metrics and injury severity. Result(s): Fractional anisotropy from DTI was sensitive to differences between damaged and healthy nerves, damaged and compressed nerves, and injured and healthy contralateral nerves. Longitudinal measurements in two injury subjects also related to clinical outcomes. Implications of other diffusion measures are also discussed. Interpretation(s): DTI is a sensitive tool for wrist nerve injuries and can be utilized for monitoring nerve recovery. Across three subjects with nerve injuries, this study has shown how DTI can detect abnormalities between injured and healthy nerves, measure recovery, and determine if re-operation was successful. Additional comparisons to carpal tunnel syndrome and healthy nerves show that DTI is sensitive to the degree of impairment.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Objective Thalamus is essential in processing of sensory information. This study explored the associations between thalamic volume and intra-Thalamic metabolites and associations to clinical and experimental characteristics of sensory function in adults with diabetic polyneuropathy. Methods 48 adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy (DPSN) and 28 healthy controls participated in a cross-sectional study and underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Estimates for thalamic volume were extracted using voxel-based morphometry and intra-Thalamic N-Acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/cre) levels were assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Associations between thalamic volume and clinical measures, quantitative sensory testing and neuropathic phenotype were explored. Results In diabetes, reduced gray matter volume was identified including bilateral thalamus (all p<=0.001) in comparison to healthy participants. Thalamic volume estimates were positively associated to intra-Thalamic NAA/cre (r=0.4; p=0.006), however not to diabetes duration (p=0.5), severity of DSPN (p=0.7), or presence of pain (p=0.3). Individuals with the lowest thalamic volume had greatest loss of protective sensation (light touch using von Frey-like filaments, p=0.037) and highest pain tolerance to electric stimulation (tetanic stimulation, p=0.008) compared to individuals with the highest thalamic volume. Conclusions In this cohort with type 1 diabetes and severe DSPN, thalamic atrophy was present and associated with reduced NAA/cre, indicating thalamic structural loss and dysfunction. Thalamic atrophy was associated to reduced sensory function involving large fiber neuropathy and sensation to tetanic stimulation that may reflect synaptic transmission. This may ultimately contribute to the current understanding of the pathophysiology behind the perception changes evident in DSPN.Copyright © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: In wild-type transthyretin-related amyloidosis (wt-TTR amyloidosis) cardiac involvement is the predominant feature. The aim of our study was to investigate neurological involvement in a cohort of patients with wt-TTR amyloidosis. Method(s): Twenty-five patients (23 men, mean age 76.6+/-7.8, range 56-86 yrs) underwent EKG and echocardiography. Cardiac MRI and 99mTc-DPD bone scintigraphy were performed in 16/25, tissue biopsies in 6 patients. All the patients underwent neurological examination, 16 also neurophysiology and 12 nerve ultrasound. Result(s): Twelve patients had atrial fibrillation, 6 needed pacemaker/ cardioverter-defibrillator, 2 aortic valve replacement. In 18/25, serum NT-proBNP and troponin were increased. EKG revealed low voltages and repolarization abnormalities in 10/25. Echocardiography disclosed increased thickness of ventricular walls in all the patients, with median ejection fraction 50.5% (range 37-66, reduction in 14/25). Cardiac MRI and bone scintigraphy (16/25) supported the diagnosis. Endomyocardial and salivary glands biopsies (in 5 and one patient, respectively) showed wt-TTR deposits. Sixteen patients had history of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), 2 of cubital tunnel syndrome, 2 of lumbar stenosis; 4 had weight loss, 5 autonomic dysfunction. Neurological examination showed weakness and paresthesias at hand muscles in 5/25. Neurophysiology (16/25) disclosed axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy in 4, mixed demyelinating-axonal features in one, CTS in 8 (6 bilateral), ulnar mononeuropathy in one patient. Nerve ultrasound (12/25) showed median nerve abnormal cross-sectional area (CSA) in 5 patients, with abnormal CSA of both sciatic nerves in one patient with axonal neuropathy, and of the brachial plexus in one patient with mixed neuropathy. Of the 5 patients with neuropathy, 2 had diabetes. Conclusion(s): Neurological involvement other than CTS was found in 18.7% of our patients, both clinically and neurophysiologically. Larger prospective studies are required to define whether wt-TTR amyloidosis might present neurological involvement besides of CTS. The fact that elderly population may present several additional risk factors for neuropathy, should also be considered.

N2  - The epilepsies are one of the most common serious brain disorders, can occur at all ages, and have many possible presentations and causes. Although incidence in childhood has fallen over the past three decades in developed countries, this reduction is matched by an increase in elderly people. Monogenic Mendelian epilepsies are rare. A clinical syndrome often has multiple possible genetic causes, and conversely, different mutations in one gene can lead to various epileptic syndromes. Most common epilepsies, however, are probably complex traits with environmental effects acting on inherited susceptibility, mediated by common variation in particular genes. Diagnosis of epilepsy remains clinical, and neurophysiological investigations assist with diagnosis of the syndrome. Brain imaging is making great progress in identifying the structural and functional causes and consequences of the epilepsies. Current antiepileptic drugs suppress seizures without influencing the underlying tendency to generate seizures, and are effective in 60-70% of individuals. Pharmacogenetic studies hold the promise of being able to better individualise treatment for each patient, with maximum possibility of benefit and minimum risk of adverse effects. For people with refractory focal epilepsy, neurosurgical resection offers the possibility of a life-changing cure. Potential new treatments include precise prediction of seizures and focal therapy with drug delivery, neural stimulation, and biological grafts. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The pathogenesis of diabetic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP) is poorly understood but there is some evidence that the disease process might extend beyond peripheral nerves. We used magnetic-resonance imaging to measure spinal-cord cross-sectional area in diabetic patients with and without DSP and in healthy controls. There were significant differences in cord area between the groups at C4/5 and T3/4 (p=0.004 and p=0.033, respectively), with a smaller cord area in those with DSP compared with controls (p=0.001 and p=0.016 for C4/5 and T3/4, respectively). These results indicate that DSP is not simply a disease of the peripheral nerve and that there is substantial involvement of the spinal cord.

N2  - Background: Ataxia is the commonest neurological manifestation of coeliac disease. Some individuals with genetic susceptibility to the disease have serological evidence of gluten sensitivity without overt gastrointestinal symptoms or evidence of small-bowel inflammation. The sole manifestation of disease in such patients may be ataxia. We describe the clinical, radiological, and neurophysiological features of this disorder. Method(s): Patients with ataxia attending the neurology outpatient clinics at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK, were screened for gluten sensitivity as shown by the titre of antibody to gliadin. Those with other causes of ataxia were excluded. We carried out clinical, neurophysiological, neuroradiological, and, in two cases, neuropathological examinations. Finding(s): 28 patients with gluten ataxia were identified. All had gait ataxia and most had limb ataxia. Those with more severe gait ataxia had longer disease duration. No patient had tremor or other extrapyramidal features. 19 patients showed some form of peripheral neuropathy on neurophysiological examination. 16 patients had no gastrointestinal symptoms. Distal duodenal biopsy showed lymphocytic infiltration in two patients, and changes compatible with coeliac disease in 11. Six patients had evidence of cerebellar atrophy on magnetic-resonance imaging. Necropsy was done on two patients who died; there was lymphocytic infiltration of the cerebellum, damage to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and sparse infiltration of the peripheral nerves. Interpretation(s): Gluten sensitivity is an important cause of apparently idiopathic ataxia and may be progressive. The ataxia is a result of immunological damage to the cerebellum, to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and to peripheral nerves. We propose the term gluten ataxia to describe this disorder.

N2  - Background: Lowering serum cholesterol is an established treatment for dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D). A recent study found that nerve lesions in T2D increase with low serum cholesterol levels, indicating that lowering serum cholesterol levels may contribute to diabetic neuropathy (DN) in T2D. (1) The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a correlation between statin doses and peripheral nerve lesions in T2D patients with and without DN. Method(s): 100 participants (52 under statin treatment, 48 without stain treatment) underwent magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) of the right leg at 3 Tesla and clinical, serological, and electrophysiological assessment. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the sciatic nerve was performed to quantify the nerve's diameter and lipid equivalent lesion load (LEL) with a subsequent correlation-analysis of all acquired clinical and serological data. Result(s): LEL correlated negatively with nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes of the tibial (r = -0.33;p = 0.014 and r = -0.31;p = 0.020, respectively) and peroneal nerve (r = -0.51;p < 0.001 and r = -0.28;p = 0.034, respectively). The statin dose, calculated as the equivalent of Simvastatin, correlated positively with the nerve's LEL (r = 0.39; p = 0.005) and the nerve's mean cross-sectional area (r = 0.40;p = 0.005). All correlations remained significant after multivariate analysis for patients' sex, age, disease duration, body-mass-index, HbA1c levels, triglycecides, Cystatin C and glomerular filtration rate. Discussion(s): Our findings indicate that the intake of statins in T2D DN is associated with a higher amount of nerve lesions and nerve swelling. These findings are relevant with regards to emerging therapies that promote an aggressive lowering of serum cholesterol in T2D. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that lowering cholesterol with statins is potentially harmful in diabetic neuropathy. Further longitudinal studies on the impact of lipid lowering therapies on the course of DN are required.

N2  - Hintergrund: Early predictors of successful nerve regeneration are urgently needed to avoid a waste of time and thus functional outcome following severe nerve injury. Up to date, however, clinical decision making mainly relies on a watch-and-wait strategy to identify potential candidates for surgical intervention in the case of failing re-innervation [1]. We used a ultra high field magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) approach in a rodent model of peripheral nerve injury to identify early MR-parameters within the nerve which may be used to predict functional outcome. Methoden: 12 female S.-Dawley rats underwent transection of the right Median nerve at upper arm level. In the gold standard group (n = 6, "Gold"), an autograft of reversed Median nerve (1 cm) was re-implanted while in the negative control group (n = 6, "Neg"), a 1 cm nerve gap was left in place. These two groups were imaged four times at forearm level on a 9.4 T MR-scanner 3, 10, 30 and 90 d post surgery. The protocol comprised a set of T2-w RARE, T1-w FLASH (+/- MTpulse), DTI and MSME sequences. Groups were followed behaviourally and histological parameters were obtained after sacrifice. Results were compared longitudinally and between groups. Ergebnisse: At 30 d, significant differences between Gold and Neg are noted for the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and radial diffusivity (RD) while other parameters show similar pathological alterations, namely T2-Time, proton density, fractional anisotropy and cross sectional area (CSA). At that time, only first signs of clinical recovery (~10% of the grip strength plateau) are present in the Gold while no function is seen in the Neg. The first time points do not show such group differences and at the last time point, only a larger CSA within the Gold is of note. Substantial phenotypical differences persist with the Neg only regaining ~20% grip strength of the Gold and showing a markedly reduced axon density. Fazit: Using ultra high field MRN in a rigorous preclinical in vivo model we identify MTR, ADC and RD as early in vivo parameters of the regenerating nerve which may potentially be used in a translational setting to predict functional outcome and guide therapeutic decision making in the future.

N2  - EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) is a preferred regimen for HIV-non-Hodgkin lymphomas (HIV-NHLs), which are frequently Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive or human herpesvirus type-8 (HHV-8) positive. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat disrupts EBV/HHV-8 latency, enhances chemotherapy-induced cell death, and may clear HIV reservoirs. We performed a randomized phase 2 study in 90 patients (45 per study arm) with aggressive HIV-NHLs, using dose-adjusted EPOCH (plus rituximab if CD201), alone or with 300 mg vorinostat, administered on days 1 to 5 of each cycle. Up to 1 prior cycle of systemic chemotherapy was allowed. The primary end point was complete response (CR). In 86 evaluable patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n 5 61), plasmablastic lymphoma (n 5 15), primary effusion lymphoma (n 5 7), unclassifiable B-cell NHL (n 5 2), and Burkitt lymphoma (n 5 1), CR rates were 74% vs 68% for EPOCH vs EPOCH-vorinostat (P 5.72). Patients with a CD41 count <200 cells/mm3 had a lower CR rate. EPOCH-vorinostat did not eliminate HIV reservoirs, resulted in more frequent grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and did not affect survival. Overall, patients with Myc1 DLBCL had a significantly lower EFS. A low diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) was also associated with inferior outcomes, whereas preprotocol therapy had no negative impact. In summary, EPOCH had broad efficacy against highly aggressive HIV-NHLs, whereas vorinostat had no benefit; patients with Myc-driven DLBCL, low CD4, and low DTI had less favorable outcomes. Permitting preprotocol therapy facilitated accruals without compromising outcomes.Copyright © 2020 American Society of Hematology. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by deficient activity of arylsulfatase A (ASA), resulting in severe motor and cognitive dysfunction. This phase 1/2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) recombinant human ASA (rhASA; HGT-1111, previously known as Metazym) in children with MLD. Method(s): Thirteen children with MLD (symptom onset < 4 years of age) were enrolled in an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation trial and received IV rhASA at 50, 100, or 200 U/kg body weight every 14 (+/- 4) days for 52 weeks (NCT00418561; NCT00633139). Eleven children continued to receive rhASA at 100 or 200 U/kg during a 24-month extension period (NCT00681811). Outcome measures included safety observations, changes in motor and cognitive function, and changes in nerve conduction and morphometry. Result(s): There were no serious adverse events considered related to IV rhASA. Motor function and developmental testing scores declined during the study in all dose groups; no significant differences were observed between groups. Nerve conduction studies and morphometric analysis indicated that peripheral nerve pathology did not worsen during the study in any dose group. Interpretation(s): IV rhASA was generally well tolerated. There was no evidence of efficacy in preventing motor and cognitive deterioration, suggesting that IV rhASA may not cross the blood-brain barrier in therapeutic quantities. The relative stability of peripheral nerve function during the study indicates that rhASA may be beneficial if delivered to the appropriate target site and supports the development of rhASA for intrathecal administration in MLD.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) and estimates of diffusivity are sensitive to the microstructure of peripheral nerves and may be displayed as tractograms. However, the ideal conditions for tractography of the roots of the brachial plexus are unclear, which represents the rationale for this study. Ten healthy adults were scanned using a Siemens Prisma (3T) and single-shot echo-planar imaging (b-value 0/1000 s/mm2, 64 directions, 2.5 mm3 with 4 averages; repeated in opposing phase encoding directions). Susceptibility correction and tractography were performed in DSI Studio by two independent raters. The effect of FA thresholding at increments of 0.01 (from 0.04 to 0.10) were tested. The mean FA varied between subjects by 2% (95% CI 1%, 3%). FA thresholds of 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 all propagated 96% of tracts representing the roots; thresholding at 0.07 yielded 4% fewer tracts (p=0.2), 0.08 yielded 11% fewer tracts (p=0.008), 0.09 yielded 15% fewer tracts (p=0.001) and 0.1 yielded 20% fewer tracts (p<0.001). There was<0.1% inter-rater variability in the measured FA and 99% agreement for tractography (kappa=0.92, p<0.001). The fractional anisotropy thresholds required to generate tractograms of the roots of the brachial plexus appears to be lower than those used in the brain. We provide estimates of the probability of generating true tracts for each spinal nerve root of the brachial plexus, at different fractional anisotropy thresholds.

N2  - Purpose: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is caused by drug-induced damage to the axons which is not detected easily due to lack of reliable, clinically applicable modalities. Diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) allows for quantitative measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which have been shown to detect nerve injury by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Method(s): We sought to evaluate if DTI could be used for detection of CIPN in patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane. Patients with h/o exposure to neurotoxic chemotherapy, diabetes, or peripheral neuropathy were excluded. Patients completed pre- and post-chemotherapy MRI of bilateral legs and FACT&GOG-Ntx. Genotyping of single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) was performed to detect known associations with CIPN. Result(s): We had 14 evaluable patients in this prospective trial. Mean FA values post-chemotherapy were significantly lower than baseline at mid-calf (p < 0.0001) and ankle (p = 0.03). We did not find any significant change in mean ADC values. In patients without symptomatic neuropathy, mean FA values decreased more than symptomatic patients at mid-calf (p < 0.001). Of the 41 genotyped SNVs, only rs8110536 was found to be significantly associated with development of CIPN. Conclusion(s): Our results show that FA values are indicative of CIPN and differential changes in FA values in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients highlights its potential to be further studied as a predictive biomarker for CIPN. This is the first study to highlight a non-invasive, imaging based, objective biomarker which, if validated, can be translated into clinic easily.Copyright © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

T1  - Probing neural tissues at small scales: Recent progress of oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) neuroimaging in humans
A1  - Xu, Junzhong 
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - The detection sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) is dependent on diffusion times. A shorter diffusion time can increase the sensitivity to smaller length scales. However, the conventional dMRI uses the pulse gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence that probes relatively long diffusion times only. To overcome this, the oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) sequence has been developed to probe much shorter diffusion times with hardware limitations on preclinical and clinical MRI systems. The OGSE sequence has been previously used on preclinical animal MRI systems. Recently, several studies have translated the OGSE sequence to humans on clinical MRI systems and achieved new information that is invisible using conventional PGSE sequence. This paper provides an overview of the recent progress of the OGSE neuroimaging in humans, including the technical improvements in the translation of the OGSE sequence to human imaging and various applications in different neurological disorders and stroke. Some possible future directions of the OGSE sequence are also discussed.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: We compared different surgical techniques for nerve regeneration in a rabbit sciatic nerve gap model using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), electrophysiology, limb function, and histology. Method(s): A total of 24 male New Zealand white rabbits were randomized into three groups: autograft (n=8), hollow conduit (n=8), and collagen-filled conduit (n=8). A 10-mm segment of the rabbit proximal sciatic nerve was cut, and autograft or collagen conduit was used to bridge the gap. DTI on a 3-T system was performed preoperatively and 13 weeks after surgery using the contralateral, nonoperated nerve as a control. Result(s): Overall, autograft performed better compared with both conduit groups. Differences in axonal diameter were significant (autograft > hollow conduit > collagen-filled conduit) at 13 weeks (autograft vs. hollow conduit, p=0.001, and hollow conduit vs. collagen-filled conduit, p<0.001). Significant group differences were found for axial diffusivity but not for any of the other DTI metrics (autograft > hollow conduit > collagen-filled conduit) (autograft vs. hollow conduit, p=0.001 and hollow conduit vs. collagen-filled conduit, p=0.021). As compared with hollow conduit (autograft > collagen-filled conduit > hollow conduit), collagen-filled conduit animals demonstrated a nonsignificant increased maximum tetanic force. Conclusion(s): Autograft-treated rabbits demonstrated improved sciatic nerve regeneration compared with collagen-filled and hollow conduits as assessed by histologic, functional, and DTI parameters at 13 weeks.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established imaging modality which is used in all districts of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems. More recently, initial studies have applied multiparametric MRI to evaluate quantitatively different aspects of musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve diseases, thus providing not only images but also numbers and clinical data. Besides 1H and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a relatively new MRI-based technique relying on principles of DWI, which has traditionally been used mainly for evaluating the central nervous system to track fibre course. In the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems, DTI has been mostly used in experimental settings, with still few indications in clinical practice. In this review, we describe the potential use of DTI to evaluate different musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve conditions, emphasising the translational aspects of this technique from the experimental to the clinical setting.

N2  - Background and purpose: We quantified peripheral nerve lesions in adults with 5q-linked spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3 by analysing the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of the sciatic nerve, and tested its potential as a novel biomarker for macromolecular changes. Method(s): Eighteen adults with SMA 3 (50% SMA 3a, 50% SMA 3b) and 18 age-/sex-matched healthy controls prospectively underwent magnetization transfer contrast imaging in a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance scanner. Two axial three-dimensional gradient echo sequences, with and without an off-resonance saturation rapid frequency pulse, were performed at the right distal thigh. Sciatic nerve regions of interest were manually traced on 10 consecutive axial slices in the images generated without off-resonance saturation, and then transferred to corresponding slices generated by the sequence with the off-resonance saturation pulse. Subsequently, MTR and cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of the sciatic nerve were analysed. In addition, detailed neurologic, physiotherapeutic and electrophysiologic examinations were conducted in all patients. Result(s): Sciatic nerve MTR and CSA reliably differentiated between healthy controls and SMA 3, 3a or 3b. MTR was lower in the SMA 3 (P < 0.0001), SMA 3a (P < 0.0001) and SMA 3b groups (P = 0.0020) than in respective controls. In patients with SMA 3, MTR correlated with all clinical scores, and arm nerve compound motor action potentials (CMAPs). CSA was lower in the SMA 3 (P < 0.0001), SMA 3a (P < 0.0001) and SMA 3b groups (P = 0.0006) than in controls, but did not correlate with clinical scores or electrophysiologic results. Conclusion(s): Magnetization transfer ratio is a novel imaging marker that quantifies macromolecular nerve changes in SMA 3, and positively correlates with clinical scores and CMAPs.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose: The recently introduced inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) method has predominantly been applied for imaging the central nervous system. Future applications of ihMT, such as in peripheral nerves and muscles, will involve imaging in the vicinity of adipose tissues. This work aims to systematically investigate the partial volume effect of fat on the ihMT signal and to propose an efficient fat-separation method that does not interfere with ihMT measurements. Method(s): First, the influence of fat on ihMT signal was studied using simulations. Next, the ihMT sequence was combined with a multi-echo Dixon acquisition for fat separation. The sequence was tested in 9 healthy volunteers using a 3T human scanner. The ihMT ratio (ihMTR) values were calculated in regions of interest in the brain and the spinal cord using standard acquisition (no fat saturation), water-only, in-phase, and out-of-phase reconstructions. The values obtained were compared with a standard fat suppression method, spectral presaturation with inversion recovery. Result(s): Simulations showed variations in the ihMTR values in the presence of fat, depending on the TEs used. The IhMTR values in the brain and spinal cord derived from the water-only ihMT multi-echo Dixon images were in good agreement with values from the unsuppressed sequence. The ihMT-spectral presaturation with inversion recovery combination resulted in 24%-35% lower ihMTR values compared with the standard non-fat-suppressed acquisition. Conclusion(s): The presence of fat within a voxel affects the ihMTR calculations. The IhMT multi-echo Dixon method does not compromise the observable ihMT effect and can potentially be used to remove fat influence in ihMT.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations were performed in ten patients with 12 acoustic neuromas before and after intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). The degree of enhancement was greatest with the inversion recovery sequence 1,500/500/44 (repetition time [TR]/inversion time/echo delay time [TE]), followed by spin-echo (SE) 544/44 (TR/TE) sequences, then by SE 1,500/44 and SE 1,500/80 sequences. After enhancement there was a 50% reduction for measured T1 values, 33% for T2, and no significant change for proton density. There were no toxic effects on patients. Enhanced CT scans failed to demonstrate lesions in six of 12 cases. Air-CT technique improved sensitivity in four of five cases. Enhanced MR imaging added significant clinical information in two small intracanalicular tumors and in one recurrent tumor.

N2  - The emergence of diffusion, structural, and functional neuroimaging methods has enabled major multi-site efforts to map the human connectome, which has heretofore been defined as containing all neural connections in the central nervous system (CNS). However, these efforts are not structured to examine the richness and complexity of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which arguably forms the (neglected) rest of the connectome. Despite increasing interest in an atlas of the spinal cord (SC) and PNS which is simultaneously stereotactic, interactive, electronically dissectible, scalable, population-based and deformable, little attention has thus far been devoted to this task of critical importance. Nevertheless, the atlasing of these complete neural structures is essential for neurosurgical planning, neurological localization, and for mapping those components of the human connectome located outside of the CNS. Here we recommend a modification to the definition of the human connectome to include the SC and PNS, and argue for the creation of an inclusive atlas to complement current efforts to map the brain's human connectome, to enhance clinical education, and to assist progress in neuroscience research. In addition to providing a critical overview of existing neuroimaging techniques, image processing methodologies and algorithmic advances which can be combined for the creation of a full connectome atlas, we outline a blueprint for ultimately mapping the entire human nervous system and, thereby, for filling a critical gap in our scientific knowledge of neural connectivity.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)

N2  - Purpose: Panoramical radiographs or cone-beam computed tomography (CT) are the standard-of-care in dental imaging to assess teeth, mandible, and mandibular canal pathologies, but do not allow assessment of the inferior alveolar nerve itself nor of its branches. We propose a new technique for "MR neurographic orthopantomograms" exploiting ultrashort echo-time (UTE) imaging of bone and teeth complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography. Material(s) and Method(s): The Institutional Review Board approved the study in 10 healthy volunteers. Imaging of the subjects mandibles at 3.0T (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens-Healthcare) using a 64-channel head coil with isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar reformatting, was performed. Bone images were acquired using a 3D PETRA sequence (TE, 0.07 msec). Morphological nerve imaging was performed using a dedicated 3D PSIF and 3D SPACE STIR sequence. Functional MR neurography was accomplished using a new accelerated diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) prototype sequence (2D SMS-accelerated RESOLVE). Qualitative and quantitative image analysis was performed and descriptive statistics are provided. Result(s): Image acquisition and subsequent postprocessing into the MR neurographic orthopantomogram by overlay of morphological and functional images were feasible in all 10 volunteers without artifacts. All mandibular bones and mandibular nerves were assessable and considered normal. Fiber tractography with quantitative evaluation of physiological diffusion properties of mandibular nerves yielded the following mean+/-SD values: fractional anisotropy, 0.43+/-0.07; mean diffusivity (mm2/s), 0.0014+/-0.0002; axial diffusivity, 0.0020+/-0.0002, and radial diffusivity, 0.0011+/-0.0001. Conclusion(s): The proposed technique of MR neurographic orthopantomogram exploiting UTE imaging complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography was feasible and allowed comprehensive assessment of osseous texture and neural microarchitecture in a single examination.Copyright © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are widely used in the evaluation of the central nervous system and recently have been reported as a potential tool for diagnosis of the peripheral nerve or the lumbar nerve entrapment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate consecutive changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of normal lumbar nerve roots from the junction of the dura mater. Method(s): The lumbar spinal nerves were examined in 6 male healthy volunteers (mean age, 35 years) with no experiences of sciatica, with a 3.0-T MR unit using a five-element phased-array surface coil. DTI was performed with the following imaging parameters: 11084.6/73.7 ms for TR/TE; b-value, 800 s/mm2; MPG, 33 directions; slice thickness, 1.5 mm; and total scan time, 7 min 35 s. ADC and FA values at all consecutive points along the L4, L5 and S1 nerves were quantified on every 1.5 mm slice from the junction of the dura mater using short fiber tracking. Result(s): ADC values of all L4, 5, and S1 nerve roots decreased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction and was constant distally afterward. ADC values in the proximal portion demonstrated S1 > L5 > L4 (p < 0.05). On the other hand, FA values increased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction, and was constant distally afterward. FA values in the proximal portion showed L4 > L5 > S1 (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated that ADC and FA values of each L4, 5, and S1 at the proximal portion from the junction of the dura matter changed linearly. It would be useful to know the normal profile of DTI values by location of each nerve root so that we can detect subtle abnormalities in each nerve root.Copyright © 2015 Miyagi et al.

N2  - Introduction: We investigated the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for detecting neuropathic changes in proximal nerve segments in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Method(s): Twenty-one individuals with (n=11) and without (n=10) peripheral neuropathy underwent DTI of a defined sciatic nerve segment. Patients and controls were evaluated by clinical examination and nerve conduction studies at baseline and 6 months after the initial DTI scan. Result(s): The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value was significantly lower in sciatic nerves from patients with peripheral neuropathy as compared with controls. Sciatic nerve FA values correlated with clinical disability scores and electrophysiological parameters of axonal damage at baseline and 6 months after MRI scan. Conclusion(s): DTI-derived FA values are a sensitive measure to discriminate healthy from functionally impaired human sciatic nerve segments. DTI of proximal nerve segments may be useful for estimating the proximal axonal degeneration burden in patients with peripheral neuropathies. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Objective: To investigate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation during somatosensory electrical stimulation of the median nerve in acute stroke patients and to determine its correlation with ischemic damage and clinical recovery over time. Method(s): Fourteen acute stroke patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during contralesional median-nerve electrical stimulation 12-48 h after stroke. Findings were then validated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and motor evoked potential by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Result(s): Poor clinical recovery at three months was noted in four patients with no activation in the early days after stroke, whereas good clinical recovery was observed in eight patients with a normal activation pattern in the primary sensory motor area in the acute phase. In two patients BOLD activation correlated weakly with clinical recovery. Findings from TMS and DTI partially correlated with clinical recovery and functional scores. Conclusion(s): Clinically relevant insights into the "functional reserve" of stroke patients gained with peripheral nerve stimulation during fMRI may carry prognostic value already in the acute period of a cerebrovascular accident. Significance: BOLD activation maps could provide insights into the functional organization of the residual systems and could contribute to medical decision making in neurological and rehabilitative treatment. © 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

N2  - Purpose: Magnetostimulation, also known as peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), is the dominant safety constraint in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the gradient magnetic fields that operate around 0.1-1 kHz, and for the homogeneous drive field in magnetic particle imaging (MPI) that operates around 10-150 kHz. Previous studies did not report correlations between anatomical measures and magnetostimulation thresholds for the gradient magnetic fields in MRI. In contrast, a strong linear correlation was shown between the thresholds and the inverse of body part size in MPI. Yet, the effects of other anatomical measures on the thresholds for the drive field remain unexplored. Here, we investigate the effects of fat percentage on magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range homogeneous magnetic fields such as the drive field in MPI, with the ultimate goal of predicting subject-specific thresholds based on simple anatomical measures. Method(s): Human subject experiments were performed on the upper arms of 10 healthy male subjects (age: 26 +/- 2 yr) to determine magnetostimulation thresholds. Experiments were repeated three times for each subject, with brief resting periods between repetitions. Using a solenoidal magnetostimulation coil, a homogeneous magnetic field at 25 kHz with 100 ms pulse duration was applied at 4-s intervals, while the subject reported stimulation via a mouse click. To determine the thresholds, individual subject responses were fitted to a cumulative distribution function modeled by a sigmoid curve. Next, anatomical images of the upper arms of the subjects were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner. A two-point Dixon method was used to obtain separate images of water and fat tissues, from which several anatomical measures were derived: the effective outer radius of the upper arm, the effective inner radius (i.e., the muscle radius), and fat percentage. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the threshold and anatomical measures. This statistical analysis was repeated after factoring out the expected effects of body part size. An updated model for threshold prediction is provided, where in addition to scaling in proportion with the inverse of the outer radius, the threshold has an affine dependence on fat percentage. Result(s): A strong linear correlation (r = 0.783, P < 0.008) was found between magnetostimulation threshold and fat percentage, and the correlation became stronger after factoring out the effects of outer radius (r = 0.839, P < 0.003). While considering body part size alone did not explain any significant variance in measured thresholds (P > 0.398), the updated model that also incorporates fat percentage yielded substantially improved threshold predictions with (Formula presented.) = 0.654 (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): This work shows for the first time that fat percentage strongly correlates with magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range homogenous magnetic fields such as the drive field in MPI, and that the correlations get even stronger after factoring out the effects of body part size. These results have important practical implications for predicting subject-specific thresholds, which in turn can increase the performance of the drive field and improve image quality while remaining within the safety limits.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine

N2  - Purpose: We investigate the importance of high gradient-amplitude and high slew-rate on oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) diffusion imaging for human brain imaging and evaluate human brain imaging with OGSE on the MAGNUS head-gradient insert (200 mT/m amplitude and 500 T/m/s slew rate). Method(s): Simulations with cosine-modulated and trapezoidal-cosine OGSE at various gradient amplitudes and slew rates were performed. Six healthy subjects were imaged with the MAGNUS gradient at 3T with OGSE at frequencies up to 100 Hz and b = 450 s/mm2. Comparisons were made against standard pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) diffusion in vivo and in an isotropic diffusion phantom. Result(s): Simulations show that to achieve high frequency and b-value simultaneously for OGSE, high gradient amplitude, high slew rates, and high peripheral nerve stimulation limits are required. A strong linear trend for increased diffusivity (mean: 8-19%, radial: 9-27%, parallel: 8-15%) was observed in normal white matter with OGSE (20 Hz to 100 Hz) as compared to PGSE. Linear fitting to frequency provided excellent correlation, and using a short-range disorder model provided radial long-term diffusivities of D,MD = 911 +/- 72 microm2/s, D,PD = 1519 +/- 164 microm2/s, and D,RD = 640 +/- 111 microm2/s and correlation lengths of lc ,MD = 0.802 +/- 0.156 microm, lc ,PD = 0.837 +/- 0.172 microm, and lc ,RD = 0.780 +/- 0.174 microm. Diffusivity changes with OGSE frequency were negligible in the phantom, as expected. Conclusion(s): The high gradient amplitude, high slew rate, and high peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds of the MAGNUS head-gradient enables OGSE acquisition for in vivo human brain imaging.Copyright © 2020 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

N2  - Purpose: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a treatable, immune-mediated condition characterised by progressive or relapsing motor and sensory neurological deficits. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, neurophysiological and supportive criteria, but can be challenging. In this study, we quantified the diameter and cross-sectional area of the lumbosacral nerve roots, and explored the imaging characteristics of the sciatic nerves, in patients with CIDP versus healthy controls using MRI. Method(s): MRI of the lumbosacral plexus and both thighs was performed at 3 T. Orthogonal diameter and cross-sectional area of the lumbosacral nerve roots were measured, along with sciatic nerve cross-sectional area at the mid-thigh level. The MRI appearance of the sciatic nerves was also evaluated qualitatively. All measurements were performed by an observer blinded to the diagnosis. Result(s): 10 patients with CIDP and 10 healthy controls (age and sex-matched) were studied. Lumbosacral nerve root diameter and cross-sectional area were significantly increased in patients with CIDP compared to controls (mean diameter 6.0 +/- 1.1 mm vs 4.8 +/- 0.3 mm; p = 0.006), with a high sensitivity (89 %) and specificity (90 %) on ROC analysis. Sciatic nerve cross sectional area was also significantly increased in the CIDP group, and was accompanied by qualitative MRI changes. Conclusion(s): Quantitative MRI reveals significant hypertrophy of the lumbosacral nerve roots and sciatic nerves in patients with CIDP compared to controls. This study provides further evidence for the inclusion of lumbosacral nerve root and sciatic nerve hypertrophy on MRI as a supportive feature in the diagnostic criteria for CIDP.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: The genetic component of multiple sclerosis (MS) is now set to 200 autosomal common variants. However, it is unclear how genetic knowledge be clinically used in the differential diagnosis between MS and other inflammatory conditions like adult-onset postinfectious neurological syndromes (PINS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether PINS and MS have a shared genetic background using an updated polygenic risk scores. Method(s): Eighty-eight PINS patients have been consecutively recruited between 1996 and 2016 at Mondino Foundation of Pavia, diagnosed according to clinical, MRI and CSF findings and followed-up for several years. Patients were typed using Illumina array, and genotypes imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. A weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) has been calculated based on autosomal MS risk loci derived from large-scale studies, and an HLA genetic burden (HLAGB) was also calculated on loci associated to MS. Result(s): PINS occurred as an episode of myelitis in 44% of patients, encephalomyelitis in 44%, and encephalitis in remaining cases, with an involvement of peripheral nervous system in 41% of patients. Mean age of onset was 50.1 years, and female:male ratio was 1.4. Patients were followed-up for a mean of 7.2 years, and at last visit 55% had a low disability grade (mRS 0-1). Disease was monophasic in 67% of patients, relapsing in 18% and chronic-progressive in 15%. The wGRS of PINS cases was comparable to 370 healthy controls, while significantly lower compared to 907 bout-onset MS (BOMS) cases (wGRS= 20.9 vs 21.2; p<0.0001). The difference was even larger for PINS with peripheral nervous system involvement (wGRS=20.6) vs BOMS. Conclusion(s): The distinction between MS and PINS is not easy to make in clinical practice. However, our study shows that the new set of MS risk alleles does not confer increased susceptibility to PINS. These data support the importance to discriminate these cases from MS with pathophysiological and therapeutic implications.Copyright © 2020

N2  - Nerve imaging is an important component in the assessment of patients presenting with suspected peripheral nerve pathology. Although magnetic resonance neurography and ultrasound are the most commonly utilized techniques, several promising new modalities are on the horizon. Nerve imaging is useful in localizing the nerve injury, determining the severity, providing prognostic information, helping establish the diagnosis, and helping guide surgical decision making. The focus of this article is imaging of damaged nerves, focusing on nerve injuries and entrapment neuropathies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe and yet most poorly understood complications of diabetes mellitus. In vivo imaging of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a key structure for the understanding of DPN, has been restricted to animal studies. These have shown a correlation of decreased DRG volume with neuropathic symptom severity. Our objective was to investigate correlations of DRG morphology and signal characteristics at 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) with clinical and serological data in diabetic patients with and without DPN. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent 3T MRN of both L5 DRG using an isotropic 3D T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence with subsequent segmentation of DRG volume and analysis of normalized signal properties. Overall, 55 diabetes patients (66 +/- 9 years; 32 men; 30 with DPN) took part in this study. DRG volume was smaller in patients with severe DPN when compared to patients with mild or moderate DPN (134.7 +/- 21.86 vs 170.1 +/- 49.22; p = 0.040). In DPN patients, DRG volume was negatively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r = -0.43; 95%CI = -0.66 to -0.14; p = 0.02), a measure of neuropathy severity. DRG volume showed negative correlations with triglycerides (r = -0.40; 95%CI = -0.57 to -0.19; p = 0.006), and LDL cholesterol (r = -0.33; 95%CI = -0.51 to -0.11; p = 0.04). There was a strong positive correlation of normalized MR signal intensity (SI) with the neuropathy symptom score in the subgroup of patients with painful DPN (r = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.46 to 0.93; p = 0.005). DRG SI was positively correlated with HbA1c levels (r = 0.30; 95%CI = 0.09 to 0.50; p = 0.03) and the triglyceride/HDL ratio (r = 0.40; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.57; p = 0.007). In this first in vivo study, we found DRG morphological degeneration and signal increase in correlation with neuropathy severity. This elucidates the potential importance of MR-based DRG assessments in studying structural and functional changes in DPN.© Copyright © 2020 Jende, Kender, Rother, Alvarez-Ramos, Groener, Pham, Morgenstern, Oikonomou, Hahn, Juerchott, Kollmer, Heiland, Kopf, Nawroth, Bendszus and Kurz.

N2  - Central nervous system involvement has been described in peripheral neuropathies, including different forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The aim of our study was to systematically investigate possible brain structural modifications in CMT1A patients, using volumetric MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this prospective cross-sectional study, from May 2017 to May 2019, we acquired 3T MRI brain scans of genetically confirmed CMT1A patients and age- and sex-comparable healthy controls. Patients also underwent clinical and electrophysiological examinations assessing motor and sensory domains. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were performed using a non-parametric approach based on permutations, including age and sex (and total intracranial volume for VBM) as nuisance covariates. When between-group differences emerged at VBM or TBSS analyses, the first eigenvariate was extracted from the cluster and its age- and sex-adjusted standardized residuals tested for correlation with clinical and electrophysiological variables. Twenty CMT1A patients (34.5 +/- 11.1 years; M/F:11/9) were enrolled, along with 20 healthy controls (30.1 +/- 10.2 years; M/F:11/9). The VBM analysis revealed clusters of significantly increased GM volume in CMT1A patients compared to healthy controls, encompassing the bilateral cerebellar lobules III-VI and the left hippocampus (all ps = 0.04), with no differences in terms of DTI metrics at the TBSS analysis. A negative correlation (r = -0.502, p = 0.03) emerged between ulnar compound motor action potential and the z-scores corresponding to the right cerebellar cluster of augmented GM volume. Our data show evidence of structural reorganization in the brain of CMT1A patients, possibly reflecting neural plasticity mechanisms in response to peripheral nerve pathology and modulating the effect of axonal degeneration on functional impairment.© Copyright © 2020 Pontillo, Dubbioso, Cocozza, Tozza, Severi, Iodice, Tedeschi, Elefante, Brunetti, Manganelli and Quarantelli.

N2  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia with around 50 million people suffering from this disease worldwide. Mutations in the ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 7 (ABCA7) have been reported to cause susceptibility to AD 9 (OMIM #608907). In this study, we report a novel variant in ABCA7 in a Saudi patient with susceptibility to AD 9 and a strong family history of neurodegenerative disorders, which may be explained by the same variant. We studied a single 57-year-old female patient with typical symptoms of AD supported by MRI findings from a Saudi family with a positive history of a similar disease in multiple individuals. The case study was conducted in King Abdulaziz Medical City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Whole-exome sequencing identified the novel heterozygous variant c.3706C>T p.(Avg 1236Cys) in the ABCA7 gene, which leads to an amino acid exchange. Furthermore, bioinformatics in silico programs predict a pathogenic effect for this variant. To the best of our knowledge, the variant has not been described in the literature so far as evidenced by a thorough literature review using multiple databases such as Ovid, Medline, EMBASE, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and PubMed. In this article, we reported a middle-aged Saudi woman with a novel variant in ABCA7 who had clinical features of both AD and Parkinson's disease. Given the reported function of this gene, it is most likely that it is etiological and pathological because of the presenting complex neurological disease due to decreased clearance of beta-amyloid and alpha-Synuclein. We illustrate the importance of this interesting gene that could be implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2020 International Advancement Center for Medicine and Health Research.

N2  - Background: Neurologic complications in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been described, but the understanding of their pathophysiologic causes and neuroanatomical correlates remains limited. Purpose(s): To report on the frequency and type of neuroradiological findings in COVID-19. Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective study, all consecutive adult hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who underwent neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May 24, 2020, were included. All examinations were systematically re-evaluated by 12 readers. Summary descriptive statistics were calculated. Result(s): A total of 185 patients with COVID-19 (62 years +/- 14 [standard deviation]; 138 men) underwent neuroimaging. In total, 222 brain CT, 47 brain MRI, and seven spinal MRI examinations were performed. Intra-axial susceptibility abnormalities were the most common finding (29 of 39; 74%, 95% CI: 58, 87) in patients who underwent brain MRI, often with an ovoid shape suggestive of microvascular pathology and with a predilection for the corpus callosum (23 of 39; 59%; 95% CI: 42, 74) and juxtacortical areas (14 of 39; 36%; 95% CI: 21, 53). Ischemic and macrohemorrhagic manifestations were also observed, but vascular imaging did not demonstrate overt abnormalities. Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 19 patients did not reveal consistent asymmetries between hemispheres or regions. Many patients (18 of 41; 44%; 95% CI: 28, 60) had leukoencephalopathy and one patient had a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum. Other findings included olfactory bulb signal abnormalities (seven of 37; 19%), prominent optic nerve subarachnoid spaces (20 of 36; 56%), and enhancement of the parenchyma (three of 20; 15%), leptomeninges (three of 20; 15%), cranial nerves (two of 20; 10%), and spinal nerves (two of four; 50%). At MRI follow-up, regression of leukoencephalopathy and progressive leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in one patient each, respectively, which is suggestive of dynamic processes. Conclusion(s): Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 had a wide spectrum of vascular and inflammatory involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system.Copyright © RSNA, 2020.

N2  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) characterises tissue microstructure and provides proxy measures of myelination, axon diameter, fibre density and organisation. This may be valuable in the assessment of the roots of the brachial plexus in health and disease. Therefore, there is a need to define the normal DTI values. Method(s): The literature was systematically searched for studies of asymptomatic adults who underwent DTI of the brachial plexus. Participant characteristics, scanning protocols, and measurements of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of each spinal root were extracted by two independent review authors. Generalised linear modelling was used to estimate the effect of experimental conditions on the FA and MD. Meta-analysis of root-level estimates was performed using Cohen's method with random effects. Result(s): Nine articles, describing 316 adults (1:1 male:female) of mean age 35 years (SD 6) were included. Increments of ten diffusion sensitising gradient directions reduced the mean FA by 0.01 (95% CI 0.01, 0.03). Each year of life reduced the mean MD by 0.03 x 10-3 mm2/s (95% CI 0.01, 0.04). At 3-T, the pooled mean FA of the roots was 0.36 (95% CI 0.34, 0.38; I2 98%). The pooled mean MD of the roots was 1.51 x 10-3 mm2/s (95% CI 1.45, 1.56; I2 99%). Conclusion(s): The FA and MD of the roots of the brachial plexus vary according to experimental conditions and participant factors. We provide summary estimates of the normative values in different conditions which may be valuable to researchers and clinicians alike.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is caused by a heterozygous deletion of peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene resulting in focal sensorimotor deficits. Our lab has identified a disruption of myelin junctions in excessively permeable myelin that impairs action potential propagation. This mechanism is expected to cause fatigue in patients with HNPP. Therefore, the objective was to characterize fatigue in patients with HNPP and determine the relationship of fatigue to nerve pathology, disability, and quality of life. Method(s): Nine females with HNPP participated in a single visit that included genotyping, nerve conduction studies, neurological exam, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, and a physical therapy exam incorporating upper and lower extremity function and survey measures of fatigue. This visit was followed by 2 weeks of ecological momentary assessment (wrist-worn device) that captured fatigue ratings five times per day. Result(s): Participants demonstrated mild neurological impairment (CMTNS: 5.7 +/- 2.8), yet reported high fatigue levels (average fatigue intensity over 2 weeks: 5.9 out of 10). Higher fatigue levels were associated with poorer quality of life and more pain. Higher fatigue was associated with significantly greater distal nerve proton density changes on peripheral nerve MRI, which is in line with hyper-permeable myelin in HNPP. Interpretation(s): Fatigue is common and severe among patients with HNPP whose disabilities are minimal by conventional outcome measures. Therapeutic interventions targeting fatigue have the potential to improve quality of life and may serve as a robust outcome measure to show longitudinal changes for patients with HNPP.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Background: We imaged the corticospinal tract (CST) and corticoreticular pathway (CRP) using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) to evaluate the cause of muscle weakness in a patient who was exposed to high-voltage electricity. Case presentation: A 39-year-old man presented with quadriparesis after high-voltage electrical shock from power lines while working about 5.8 years ago. The electrical current entered through the left hand and exited through the occipital area of the head. The degree of weakness on bilateral upper and lower extremities was 3-4 on the Medical Research Council strength scale. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed 5.8 years after onset. The CST and CRP were depicted by placing two regions of interest for each neural tract on the two-dimensional fractional anisotropy color map. DTT of the DTI scan showed that the bilateral CST and CRP were thinned compared to those of the healthy control subject. On the nerve conduction test, abnormal findings suggesting peripheral nerve lesion were not observed. Therefore, injury of bilateral CST and CRP seems to have contributed to our patient's weakness after the electrical shock. Conclusion(s): Depiction of neural tracts in the brain using DTT can assist in the accurate and detailed evaluation of the cause of neural deficit after electrical injury.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome, affecting a large proportion of the general population. Genetic susceptibility has been implicated in CTS, but the causative genes remain elusive. Here, we report the identification of two mutations in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) that segregate with CTS in two large families with or without multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED). Both mutations impair the secretion of COMP by tenocytes, but the mutation associated with MED also perturbs its secretion in chondrocytes. Further functional characterization of the CTS-specific mutation reveals similar histological and molecular changes of tendons/ligaments in patients' biopsies and the mouse models. The mutant COMP fails to oligomerize properly and is trapped in the ER, resulting in ER stress-induced unfolded protein response and cell death, leading to inflammation, progressive fibrosis and cell composition change in tendons/ligaments. The extracellular matrix (ECM) organization is also altered. Our studies uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism in CTS pathogenesis.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - We previously reported that neuropathic pain was associated with smaller posterior cingulate cortical (PCC) volumes, suggesting that a smaller/dysfunctional PCC may contribute to development of pain via impaired mind wandering. A gap in our previous report was lack of evidence for a mechanism for the genesis of PCC atrophy in HIV peripheral neuropathy. Here we investigate if volumetric differences in the subcortex for those with neuropathic paresthesia may contribute to smaller PCC volumes, potentially through deafferentation of ascending white matter tracts resulting from peripheral nerve damage in HIV neuropathy. Since neuropathic pain and paresthesia are highly correlated, statistical decomposition was used to separate pain and paresthesia symptoms to determine which regions of brain atrophy are associated with both pain and paresthesia and which are associated separately with pain or paresthesia. HIV+ individuals (N = 233) with and without paresthesia in a multisite study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry and a segmentation/registration tool were used to investigate regional brain volume changes associated with paresthesia. Analysis of decomposed variables found that smaller midbrain and thalamus volumes were associated with paresthesia rather than pain. However, atrophy in the PCC was related to both pain and paresthesia. Peak thalamic atrophy (p = 0.004; MNI x = - 14, y = - 24, z = - 2) for more severe paresthesia was in a region with reciprocal connections with the PCC. This provides initial evidence that smaller PCC volumes in HIV peripheral neuropathy are related to ascending white matter deafferentation caused by small fiber damage observed in HIV peripheral neuropathy.Copyright © 2020, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.

N2  - The group of Multiplied, Added, Subtracted and/or fiTted Inversion Recovery (MASTIR) pulse sequences in which usually two or more inversion recovery (IR) images of different types are combined is described, and uses for this type of sequence are outlined. IR sequences of different types can be multiplied, added, subtracted, and/or fitted together to produce variants of the MASTIR sequence. The sequences provide a range of options for increasing image contrast, demonstrating specific tissues and fluids of interest, and suppressing unwanted signals. A formalism using the concept of pulse sequences as tissue property filters is used to explain the signal, contrast and weighting of the pulse sequences with both univariate and multivariate filter models. Subtraction of one magnitude reconstructed IR image from another with a shorter TI can produce very high T1 dependent positive contrast from small increases in T1. The reverse subtracted IR sequence can provide high positive contrast enhancement with gadolinium chelates and iron deposition which decrease T1. Additional contrast to that arising from increases in T1 can be produced by supplementing this with contrast arising from concurrent increases in rhom and T2, as well as increases or decreases in diffusion using subtraction IR with echo subtraction and/or diffusion subtraction. Phase images may show 180differences as a result of rotating into the transverse plane both positive and negative longitudinal magnetization. Phase images with contrast arising in this way, or other ways, can be multiplied by magnitude IR images to increase the contrast of the latter. Magnetization Transfer (MT) and susceptibility can be used with IR sequences to improve contrast. Selective images of white and brown adipose tissue lipid and water components can be produced using different TIs and in and out-of-phase TEs. Selective images of ultrashort and short T2 tissue components can be produced by nulling long T2 tissue components with an inversion pulse and subtraction of images with longer TEs from images with ultrashort TEs. The Double Echo Sliding IR (DESIRE) sequence provides images with a wide range of TIs from which it is possible to choose values of TI to achieve particular types of tissue and/or fluid contrast (e.g., for subtraction with different TIs, as described above, and for long T2 tissue signal nulling with UTE sequences). Unwanted tissue and fluid signals can be suppressed by addition and subtraction of phase-sensitive (ps) and magnitude reconstructed images. The sequence also offers options for synergistic use of the changes in blood and tissue rhom, T1, T2/T2*, D* and perfusion that can be seen with fMRI of the brain. In-vivo and ex-vivo illustrative examples of normal brain, cartilage, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and peripheral nerve imaged with different forms of the MASTIR sequence are included.Copyright © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of fiber tractography and diffusivity analysis generated from 3D diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences for preoperative assessment of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Method(s): MR imaging at 3 T was performed in 22 patients (mean age 41.9 +/- 17.1y, 13 women) with histologically confirmed schwannomas (N = 18) and histologically confirmed neurofibromas (N = 11), including a 3D DW turbo spin echo sequence with fat suppression. Diffusion tensor parameters were computed and fiber tracks were determined. Evaluation was performed by two radiologists and one orthopedic surgeon blinded for final diagnosis. Mean diffusivity was computed to allow further assessment of tumor microstructure. Preoperative fascicle visualization was graded, fascicles were categorized regarding anatomical location and amount of fascicles surrounding the tumor. The agreement of imaging findings with intraoperative findings was assessed. Result(s): On 78.3 % of the DTI images, the fascicle visualization was rated as good or very good. Tractography differences were observed in schwannomas and neurofibromas, showing schwannomas to be significantly more often located eccentrically to the nerve (94.8 %) than neurofibromas (0 %, P < 0.01). Fascicles were significantly more often continuous (87.5 %) in schwannomas, while in neurofibromas, none of the tracks was graded to be continuous (0 %, P = 0.014). A substantial agreement between fiber tracking and surgical anatomy was found regarding the fascicle courses surrounding the tumor (kappa = 0.78). Mean diffusivity of schwannomas (1.5 +/- 0.2 x 10-3 mm2/s) was significantly lower than in neurofibromas (1.8 +/- 0.2 x 10-3 mm2/s; P < 0.001). The Youden index showed an optimal cutoff at 1.7 x 10-3 mm2/s (sensitivity, 0.91; specificity, 0.78; J = 0.69). Conclusion(s): Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging allowed to accurately differentiate between schwannomas and neurofibromas and to describe their location in relation to the nerve fascicles for preoperative planning.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - We systematically identified and reviewed 29 studies of peripheral nerve ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRN) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The majority of the ultrasound studies reported smaller nerves and nerve roots in ALS compared to healthy controls, but there was a large overlap of the cross-sectional nerve area between ALS and controls. Most of the MRN studies confirmed nerve abnormalities demonstrating slight T2 hyperintensities and, sometimes, mild enlargement of more proximal nerve segments (plexus, roots) in ALS. The size of the proximal nerve segments, i.e. nerve roots, is thus somewhat incongruent between nerve ultrasound and MRN in ALS. Peripheral nerve ultrasound has the potential to differentiate between ALS and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) in that patients with MMN have significantly larger nerves. Conversely, there is an overlap of MRN abnormalities in ALS and MMN, restricting the techniques' utility in the clinical setting. A subgroup of patients with ALS seems to reveal a sonographic nerve pattern suggesting peripheral nerve inflammation. In the future, combined imaging with nerve ultrasound and MRN assessing parameters such as blood flow or textural markers may aid in the understanding of the deep nerve microstructure down to the fascicle level, and thus, in the classification of the nerve state as more degenerative or more inflammatory in ALS. This systematic review provides evidence that nerve imaging abnormalities are common in ALS.Copyright © 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology

N2  - Objective: To quantify peripheral nerve lesions in symptomatic and asymptomatic hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PNP) by analyzing the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of the sciatic nerve, and to test its potential as a novel biomarker for macromolecular changes. Method(s): Twenty-five patients with symptomatic ATTRv-PNP, 30 asymptomatic carriers of the mutant transthyretin gene (mutTTR), and 20 age-/sex-matched healthy controls prospectively underwent magnetization transfer contrast imaging at 3 Tesla. Two axial three-dimensional gradient echo sequences with and without an off-resonance saturation rapid frequency pulse were conducted at the right distal thigh. Sciatic nerve regions of interest were manually drawn on 10 consecutive axial slices in the images without off-resonance saturation, and then transferred to the corresponding slices that were generated by the sequence with the off-resonance saturation pulse. Subsequently, the MTR and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the sciatic nerve were evaluated. Detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic examinations were conducted in all ATTRv-PNP patients and mutTTR-carriers. Result(s): Sciatic nerve MTR and CSA reliably differentiated between ATTRv-PNP, mutTTR-carriers, and controls. MTR was lower in ATTRv-PNP (26.4 +/- 0.7; P < 0.0001) and in mutTTR-carriers (32.6 +/- 0.8; P = 0.0005) versus controls (39.4 +/- 2.1), and was also lower in ATTRv-PNP versus mutTTR-carriers (P = 0.0009). MTR correlated negatively with the NIS-LL and positively with CMAPs and SNAPs. CSA was higher in ATTRv-PNP (34.3 +/- 1.7 mm3) versus mutTTR-carriers (26.0 +/- 1.1 mm3; P = 0.0005) and versus controls (20.4 +/- 1.2 mm3; P < 0.0001). CSA was also higher in mutTTR-carriers versus controls. Interpretation(s): MTR is a novel imaging marker that can quantify macromolecular changes in ATTRv-PNP and differentiate between symptomatic ATTRv-PNP and asymptomatic mutTTR-carriers and correlates with electrophysiology.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Background: There is histological evidence of microstructural changes in the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve in migraineurs. This raises the possibility that altered trigeminal nerve properties contribute to migraine pathophysiology. Whilst it is not possible to explore the anatomy of small trigeminal nerve branches it is possible to explore the anatomy of the trigeminal root entry zone using magnetic resonance imaging in humans. The aim of this investigation is to assess the microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in vivo to determine if nerve alterations occur in individuals with episodic migraine. Method(s): In 39 migraineurs and 39 matched controls, T1-weighted anatomical images were used to calculate the volume (mm3) and maximal cross-sectional area of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone; diffusion tensor images were used to calculate fractional anisotropy, mean diffusion, axial diffusion and radial diffusion. Result(s): There were significant differences between the left and right nerve of controls and migraineurs with respect to volume and not cross-sectional area. Migraineurs displayed reduced axial diffusion in the right nerve compared to the left nerve, and reduced fractional anisotropy in the left nerve compared to left controls. Furthermore, although there were no differences in mean diffusion or radial diffusion, regional analysis of the nerve revealed significantly greater radial diffusion in the middle and rostral portion of the left trigeminal nerve in migraineurs compared with controls. Conclusion(s): Migraine pathophysiology is associated with microstructural abnormalities within the trigeminal nerve that are consistent with histological evidence of altered myelin and/or organization. These peripheral nerve changes may provide further insight into migraine pathophysiology and enable a greater understanding for targeted treatments of pain alleviation.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - The peripheral nervous system is increasingly being investigated using medical imaging as a complement or in association with electrodiagnostics tests. The application of imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allows detailed visualization of the peripheral nervous system. According to the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, the use of US for nerve evaluation is strongly encouraged. In addition, the role of US is further enhanced by the wide application of US-guided techniques to diagnose or to treat peripheral nerve disorders. Standard evaluation of peripheral nerves on US usually relies on cross-sectional area evaluation with different cutoff values in the osteofibrous tunnels and outside them. In several anatomical areas, side-to-side comparison is highly recommended because it helps distinguish subtle variations by using the unaffected limb as an internal control. US is widely used to perform US-guided interventional procedures on peripheral nerves. The recent development of radiomics and machine and deep learning applied to peripheral nerves may reveal new insights beyond the capabilities of the human eye. Radiomics may have a role in expanding the diagnostic capabilities of US and MRI in the study of peripheral nerve pathology, especially when the cross-sectional area is not markedly increased.Copyright © 2020 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

N2  - Spinal cord injuries (SCI) normally disrupt the long axonal tracts of the spinal cord and cause permanent neurological deficits, for which there is currently a lack of effective therapeutic methods. Biomaterial-based regenerative medicine is a pivotal strategy to induce axonal regeneration through delivery of biophysical and/or biochemical regulatory cues by biomaterials. We previously fabricated a hierarchically aligned fibrin hydrogel (AFG) that could promote neurogenic differentiation of stem cells in vitro and has been successfully applied for peripheral nerve and spinal cord regeneration in rats. In this study, AFG was used to repair a canine lumbar segment 2 hemisection spinal cord injury, and the consistency of histological, imageological and behavioral results was compared. AFG was used to construct an aligned fiber bridge that supported cell adhesion in vitro and rapidly facilitated tissue invasion along the long axis of fibers in vivo, Moreover, in vivo results demonstrated regrowth of axons in an oriented pattern connecting the rostral and caudal stumps. Consistent results were confirmed by diffusion tensor imaging, which allowed successful tracing of reconnected nerve fibers across the defect. As a result, directional axonal regrowth contributed to significantly improved recovery of motor functional behavior of SCI canines with AFG implantation. Our results suggest that AFG has great promise for rapidly directing axonal regrowth for nerve regeneration.

N2  - Background: Due to the lack of understanding of the fascicular organisation, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) leads to unwanted off-target effects. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) can be used to trace fascicles from periphery and image fascicular anatomy. New method: In this study, we present a simple and reproducible method for imaging fascicles in peripheral nerves with iodine staining and microCT for the determination of fascicular anatomy and organisation. Result(s): At the determined optimal pre-processing steps and scanning parameters, the microCT protocol allowed for segmentation and tracking of fascicles within the nerves. This was achieved after 24 hours and 120 hours of staining with Lugol's solution (1% total iodine) for rat sciatic and pig vagus nerves, respectively, and the following scanning parameters: 4 mum voxel size, 35 kVp energy, 114 muA current, 4 W power, 0.25 fps in 4 s exposure time, 3176 projections and a molybdenum target. Comparison with existing method(s): This optimised method for imaging fascicles provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images and full imaging penetration depth not obtainable with methods typically used such as histology, magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence tomography whilst obviating time-consuming pre-processing methods, the amount of memory required, destruction of the samples and the cost associated with current microCT methods. Conclusion(s): The optimised microCT protocol facilitates segmentation and tracking of the fascicles within the nerve. The resulting segmentation map of the functional anatomical organisation of the vagus nerve will enable selective VNS ultimately allowing for the avoidance of the off-target effects and improving its therapeutic efficacy.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the evaluation of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) compared to clinical scores and nerve conduction studies (NCS). Patients and Methods: We included 30 patients with diabetes mellitus complaining of neuropathy symptoms and 15 healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent evaluation using 1.5-T DTI of median nerves and NCS. Patients underwent clinical evaluation using the Neuropathy Deficit Score (NDS), Neuropathy Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL), and Diabetic Neuropathy Examination (DNE) score. Result(s): We found statistically significant differences between healthy volunteers and patients in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the distal segment (P = 0.016) and whole median nerve (P = 0.024), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of proximal (P = 0.027) and distal (P < 0.001) segments, and whole median nerve (P = 0.019). Distal segment FA was significantly correlated with NDS (P = 0.003), DNEs (P = 0.003), sensory amplitude (P = 0.048), and motor CV (P = 0.020). Distal segment ADC was significantly correlated with NDS (P = 0.007), NIS-LL (P = 0.003), DNEs (P = 0.01), and sensory amplitude (P = 0.032). The best cut-off value of distal segment for FA was 0.45 (87% sensitivity, 80% specificity) and of distal segment ADC was 1.217 (80% sensitivity and specificity). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that 1.5-T DTI examination of the median nerve can provide useful non-invasive information in patients with DPN.

N2  - The underlying factors contributing to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity, a known precursor to skin breakdown in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM), is likely to involve multiple body systems. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify multi-system factors associated with metatarsophalangeal joint deformity in individuals with type 2 DM and peripheral neuropathy (n = 60). Metatarsophalangeal joint deformity was quantified with a computed tomography (CT) scan. System biomarkers included the musculoskeletal system (foot intrinsic muscle deterioration, tarsal/metatarsal bone mineral density, ankle dorsiflexion, metatarsophalangeal extension movement during a sit to stand task); the vascular system (ankle-brachial index); and the endocrine/immune systems (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, skin intrinsic fluorescence, and hemoglobin A1C). Muscle deterioration (r = 0.27), bone density (r = -0.35), metatarsophalangeal extension movement (r = 0.50), maximum dorsiflexion (r = -0.31), and ankle-brachial index (r = 0.33) were related to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity (p < 0.05). Bone mineral density and metatarsophalangeal extension movement were retained in a regression model relating to deformity (R2 = 0.34). All musculoskeletal system biomarkers and the ankle-brachial index demonstrated weak to moderate relationships to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity. Bone mineral density of the tarsal/metatarsal bones and extending the toes during a sit to stand task were the two strongest factors associated with metatarsophalangeal joint deformity. Evaluation and management of foot bone mineral density and toe extension movement pattern could reduce metatarsophalangeal joint deformity and the risk of skin breakdown and subsequent amputation.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Objective: Brain atrophy is an established biomarker for dementia, yet spinal cord involvement has not been investigated to date. As the spinal cord is relaying sensorimotor control signals from the cortex to the peripheral nervous system and vice-versa, it is indeed a very interesting question to assess whether it is affected by atrophy due to a disease that is known for its involvement of cognitive domains first and foremost, with motor symptoms being clinically assessed too. We, therefore, hypothesize that in Alzheimer's disease (AD), severe atrophy can affect the spinal cord too and that spinal cord atrophy is indeed an important in vivo imaging biomarker contributing to understanding neurodegeneration associated with dementia. Method(s): 3DT1 images of 31 AD and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were processed to calculate volume of brain structures and cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume (CSV) of the cervical cord [per vertebra as well as the C2-C3 pair (CSA23 and CSV23)]. Correlated features (rho > 0.7) were removed, and the best subset identified for patients' classification with the Random Forest algorithm. General linear model regression was used to find significant differences between groups (p <= 0.05). Linear regression was implemented to assess the explained variance of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score as a dependent variable with the best features as predictors. Result(s): Spinal cord features were significantly reduced in AD, independently of brain volumes. Patients classification reached 76% accuracy when including CSA23 together with volumes of hippocampi, left amygdala, white and gray matter, with 74% sensitivity and 78% specificity. CSA23 alone explained 13% of MMSE variance. Discussion(s): Our findings reveal that C2-C3 spinal cord atrophy contributes to discriminate AD from HC, together with more established features. The results show that CSA23, calculated from the same 3DT1 scan as all other brain volumes (including right and left hippocampi), has a considerable weight in classification tasks warranting further investigations. Together with recent studies revealing that AD atrophy is spread beyond the temporal lobes, our result adds the spinal cord to a number of unsuspected regions involved in the disease. Interestingly, spinal cord atrophy explains also cognitive scores, which could significantly impact how we model sensorimotor control in degenerative diseases with a primary cognitive domain involvement. Prospective studies should be purposely designed to understand the mechanisms of atrophy and the role of the spinal cord in AD.© Copyright © 2020 Lorenzi, Palesi, Castellazzi, Vitali, Anzalone, Bernini, Cotta Ramusino, Sinforiani, Micieli, Costa, D'Angelo and Gandini Wheeler-Kingshott.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN: We examined the chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) patients and non-CIDP patients who have similar symptoms and difficult to differential diagnosis with CIDP by magnetic resonance neurography to find the difference among them. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the differential diagnostic value of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) for CIDP and other peripheral neuropathies. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Thirty-two consecutive patients with CIDP and 22 non-CIDP patients with symptoms similar to CIDP and difficult to be discriminate were recruited and imaged as a control group between May 2017 and May 2019. METHOD(S): In this prospective study, the brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus of 32 CIDP patients and 22 non-CIDP patients were examined by MRN. The clinical features and the nerve roots cross-sectional area (CSA) of the brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus were measured. RESULT(S): The CSA of nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1 and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes syndrome patients were all shown extensive by MRN. The sensitivity of MRN in diagnosing CIDP was 81.25% (26/32), the specificity was 68.18% (15/22), the positive predictive value was 78.79% (26/33), the negative predictive value was 71.43% (15/21), the accuracy was 75.93% (40/54), the misdiagnosis rate was 24.07% (13/54), and the kappa value was 0.498. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for CIDP with the CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.762) and that of the brachial plexus (AUC = 0.762), and the combined of both examinations did not improve the diagnostic efficacy compared with either (AUC = 0.769). CONCLUSION(S): The nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1, and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes syndrome were difficult to distinguish by MRN. Atypical CIDP patients had less nerve root injury compared with typical CIDP patients. MRN of either the brachial plexus or the lumbosacral plexus had a high diagnostic accuracy for CIDP, and it is not necessary to perform both parts of the examination.2.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that a magnetic resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can differentiate between crush and complete transection peripheral nerve injuries in a rat model ex vivo. DTI measures the directionally dependent effect of tissue barriers on the random diffusion of water molecules. In ordered tissues such as nerves, this information can be used to reconstruct the primary direction of diffusion along fiber tracts, which may provide information on fiber tract continuity after nerve injury and surgical repair. METHOD(S): Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with different degrees of partial transection of the sciatic nerve followed by immediate repair and euthanized after 1 week of recovery. Nerves were then harvested, fixed, and scanned with a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging to obtain DTIand fiber tractography in each sample. Additional behavioral (sciatic function index, foot fault asymmetry) and histological (Toluidine blue staining) assessments were performed for validation. RESULT(S): Tractography yielded a visual representation of the degree of injury that correlated with behavioral and histological evaluations. CONCLUSION(S): DTI tractography is a noninvasive tool that can yield a visual representation of a partial nerve transection as early as 1 week after surgical repair.Copyright © The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

N2  - Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) has been used extensively to study pathological conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, tissue damage is assessed qualitatively with little information regarding the underlying pathophysiological processes involved. Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging method which is sensitive to tissue macromolecular content and may therefore have an important role in the study of pathologies affecting the PNS. This study explored the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus of healthy volunteers using MRN to identify and segment each lumbar segment (L2-L5) and regions (preganglionic, ganglionic and postganglionic). Reproducibility of the MTR measurements and of the segmentation method were assessed from repeated measurements (scan-rescan), and from the reanalysis of images (intra- and inter-rater assessment), by calculating the coefficient of variation (COV). In all segments combined (L2-L5), mean (+/-SD) MTR was 30.5 (+/-2.4). Scan-rescan, intra- and inter-rater COV values were 3.2%, 4.4% and 5.3%, respectively. One-way analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference in MTR between the preganglionic and postganglionic regions in all lumbar segments. This pilot study in healthy volunteers demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus, opening up the possibility of studying a broad spectrum of neurological conditions in vivo.

N2  - Background: Small peripheral nerve tractography is challenging because of the trade-off among resolution, image acquisition time, and signal-to-noise ratio. Purpose(s): To optimize pixel size and slice thickness parameters for fiber tractography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen healthy volunteers (mean age 30 +/- 6.8 years) were recruited prospectively. Axial T2-weighted and DTI scans were acquired, covering the cubital tunnel, using different pixel sizes and slice thicknesses. Three-dimensional (3D) nerve tractography was evaluated for the median number and length of the reconstructed fiber tracts and visual score from 0 to 5. Two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional DTI was evaluated for fractional anisotropy (FA) values throughout the length of the ulnar nerve. Result(s): A pixel size of 1.3 mm2 revealed the highest number of reconstructed nerve fibers compared to that of 1.1 mm2 (P = 0.048), with a good visual score. A slice thickness of 4 mm had the highest number of reconstructed nerve fibers and visual score compared with other thicknesses (all P < 0.05). In 2D cross-sectional images, the median FA values were in the range of 0.40-0.63 at the proximal, central, and distal portions of the cubital tunnel. Inter-observer agreement for all parameters was good to excellent. Conclusion(s): For fiber tractography and DTI of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel, optimal image quality was obtained using a 1.3-mm2 pixel size and 4-mm slice thickness under MR parameters of this study at 3T.Copyright © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2020.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nerve regeneration after an injury should occur in a timely fashion for function to be restored. Current methods cannot monitor regeneration prior to muscle reinnervation. Diffusion tensor imaging has been previously shown to provide quantitative indices after nerve recovery. The goal of this study was to validate the use of this technology following nerve injury via a series of rat sciatic nerve injury/repair studies. METHOD(S): Sprague-Dawley rats were prospectively divided by procedure (sham, crush, or cut/repair) and time points (1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after surgery). At the appropriate time point, each animal was euthanized and the sciatic nerve was harvested and fixed. Data were obtained using a 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system. For validation, findings were compared to behavioral testing (foot fault asymmetry and sciatic function index) and cross-sectional axonal counting of toluidine blue-stained sections examined under light microscopy. RESULT(S): Sixty-three rats were divided into three treatment groups (sham, n = 21; crush, n = 23; and cut/repair, n = 19). Fractional anisotropy was able to differentiate between recovery following sham, crush, and cut/repair injuries as early as 2 weeks (p < 0.05), with more accurate differentiation thereafter. More importantly, the difference in anisotropy between distal and proximal regions recognized animals with successful and failed recoveries according to behavioral analysis, especially at 12 weeks. In addition, diffusion tension imaging-based tractography provided a visual representation of nerve continuity in all treatment groups. CONCLUSION(S): Diffuse tensor imaging is an objective and noninvasive tool for monitoring nerve regeneration. Its use could facilitate earlier detection of failed repairs to potentially help improve outcomes.

N2  - Purpose: To establish peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) thresholds for an ultra-high performance magnetic field gradient subsystem (simultaneous 200-mT/m gradient amplitude and 500-T/m/s gradient slew rate; 1 MVA per axis [MAGNUS]) designed for neuroimaging with asymmetric transverse gradients and 42-cm inner diameter, and to determine PNS threshold dependencies on gender, age, patient positioning within the gradient subsystem, and anatomical landmarks. Method(s): The MAGNUS head gradient was installed in a whole-body 3T scanner with a custom 16-rung bird-cage transmit/receive RF coil compatible with phased-array receiver brain coils. Twenty adult subjects (10 male, mean +/- SD age = 40.4 +/- 11.1 years) underwent the imaging and PNS study. The tests were repeated by displacing subject positions by 2-4 cm in the superior-inferior and anterior-posterior directions. Result(s): The x-axis (left-right) yielded mostly facial stimulation, with mean DELTAGmin = 111 +/- 6 mT/m, chronaxie = 766 +/- 76 microsec. The z-axis (superior-inferior) yielded mostly chest/shoulder stimulation (123 +/- 7 mT/m, 620 +/- 62 microsec). Y-axis (anterior-posterior) stimulation was negligible. X-axis and z-axis thresholds tended to increase with age, and there was negligible dependency with gender. Translation in the inferior and posterior directions tended to increase the x-axis and z-axis thresholds, respectively. Electric field simulations showed good agreement with the PNS results. Imaging at MAGNUS gradient performance with increased PNS threshold provided a 35% reduction in noise-to-diffusion contrast as compared with whole-body performance (80 mT/m gradient amplitude, 200 T/m/sec gradient slew rate). Conclusion(s): The PNS threshold of MAGNUS is significantly higher than that for whole-body gradients, which allows for diffusion gradients with short rise times (under 1 msec), important for interrogating brain microstructure length scales.Copyright © 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to provide normal reference values for quantitative parameters for brachial and lumbosacral plexi on multimodal MRI. In addition, the parameter variations between the left and right sides, the individual nerve groups, genders and age groups were also evaluated. Material(s) and Method(s): Multimodal MRI was evaluated in 163 healthy subjects, who were randomly divided into three groups: brachial plexus, lumbosacral plexus and diffusion tensor imaging groups. Nerve diameters, contrast ratios, T2 nerve-muscle signal ratios (nT2), fractional anisotropy (FA)values and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC)were measured in both plexi. Parametric tests and Pearson correlation for normally distributed data, and non-parametric tests and Spearman correlation for non-normally distributed data were used. Result(s): There were no significant differences in parameters between the left and right sides. The diameters of the C7, L4-S1, sciatic, and femoral nerve roots were larger in men than in women (P < 0.05). The nT2 in the brachial and lumbosacral plexi and the contrast ratio in the lumbosacral plexus were significantly higher in the elderly. The diameter of the S1 nerve root was smaller in the elderly. There were no significant differences between the individual nerve groups in contrast ratios and in brachial plexus nT2. A gradual increase in the nT2 from the top to the bottom was observed in the L4-S1 nerve roots (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): This study provides multi-parameter normative data for the brachial and lumbosacral plexi while considering differences between the two sides, the individual nerves, genders, and the ages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) adds functional information to morphological magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in the assessment of the brachial nerve plexus. To determine the most appropriate pulse sequence in scan times suited for diagnostic imaging in clinical routine, we compared image quality between simultaneous multi-slice readout-segmented (rs-DTI) and conventional single-shot (ss-DTI) echo-planar imaging techniques. METHOD(S): Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved study including 10 healthy volunteers. The supraclavicular brachial plexus, covering the nerve roots and trunks from C5 to C7, was imaged on both sides with rs-DTI and ss-DTI. Both sequences were acquired in scan times <7 min with b-values of 900 s/mm2 and with isotropic spatial resolution. RESULT(S): In rs-DTI image, the overall quality was significantly better and distortion artifacts were significantly lower (P = 0.001-0.002 and P = 0.001-0.002, respectively) for both readers. In ss-DTI, a trend toward lower degree of ghosting and motion artifacts was elicited (reader 1, P = 0.121; reader 2, P = 0.264). No significant differences between the two DTI techniques were found for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (P >= 0.475, P >= 0.624, and P >= 0.169, respectively). Interreader agreement for all examined parameters and all sequences ranged from intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.064 to 0.905 and Kappa 0.40 to 0.851. CONCLUSION(S): Incomparable acquisition times rs-DTI showed higher image quality and less distortion artifacts than ss-DTI. The trend toward a higher degree of ghosting and motion artifacts in rs-DTI did not deteriorate image quality to a significant degree. Thus, rs-DTI should be considered for functional MRN of the brachial plexus.

N2  - Background: Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) can affect up to a third of patients undergoing chemotherapy. CIPN is thought to be caused by drug induced damage to the peripheral motor or sensory nervous system. Symptoms range from tingling and numbness to balance issues and falls. Based on severity of symptoms, chemotherapy (CTX) is delayed, reduced, or discontinued which can adversely affect outcomes. Currently there are no predictive biomarkers to identify those at risk of developing CIPN. Diffuse tensor imaging (DTI), a subtype of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), measured by routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly evaluated to assess nerve fiber trajectory. DTI allows for quantitative measurements such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) which have shown some promising but mixed results in evaluating peripheral neuropathy and CIPN in some studies. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate if quantitative DTI measurements, FA and ADC, at mid-calf and ankle can evaluate CTX induced nerve damage and predict development of CIPN. Method(s): We conducted a prospective study in patients with breast cancer who were treated with a taxane-based CTX regimen. Study was approved by our institutional review board and registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03365895). Patients who were eligible to get CTX with a taxane based regimen (paclitaxel or docetaxel) were included. Patients with prior exposure to neurotoxic CTX, significant peripheral neuropathy at baseline, or history of diabetes were excluded. All patients completed pre and post CTX MRI of bilateral leg and ankles and a self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecological Oncology Group neurotoxic questionnaire (FACT-NTX). Patients were diagnosed with developing symptomatic neuropathy if the absolute increase in their FACT-NTX score was =3 at post treatment evaluation. Result(s): Twenty patients consented however 6 were ineligible. Fourteen patients completed all the study procedures. Median age of the evaluable patients was 53 years (33-72 years); 11/14 had paclitaxel CTX. For all patients, median baseline FACT-NTX score was significantly lower (2.5) than post treatment score (5.5) (p=0.009). Based on FACT-NTX score changes, 64% of patients developed symptomatic neuropathy. For all patients, the minimum FA values post-chemotherapy at mid-calf and ankle (0.42 and 0.41 respectively) are significantly lower than baseline (0.54 and 0.49 respectively, p=<0.0001 at mid-calf, p=0.03 at ankle) indicating change in nerve structure with CTX. There was no significant change in mean ADC measurements at mid-calf and ankle pre CTX (1.21 and 1.17 respectively) versus post CTX (1.29 and 1.9 respectively, p=0.14 for mid-calf, p=0.9 at ankle). In patients who developed neuropathy, the median minimum FA value at mid-calf at baseline was lower compared to those who did not (p=0.016). Conclusion(s): Our study highlights the use of measuring minimum FA value at the mid-calf and ankle to evaluate for CIPN. Our results indicate that minimum FA value decreased with CTX induced nerve damage and a lower baseline measurement is likely predictive of developing CIPN. This suggests that minimum FA value can be used as a noninvasive imaging biomarker to help predict those at risk for CIPN and potentially be used to implement prevention strategies. Additional clinical trials are warranted to further evaluate this promising predictive biomarker.

N2  - This chapter offers a comprehensive summary of applications of advanced diffusion encoding methods in MRI within a narrowly defined area of in vivo human measurements with imaging read-out and voxel-by-voxel data analysis. The list of methods comprises tensor-valued encoding to investigate cell densities, shapes, and orientations in heterogeneous tissues, time/frequency-dependent encoding for estimating structural length scales, adjustable velocity-encoding to monitor flow in the microcapillary network, double encoding with varying mixing times to assess diffusional exchange between distinct tissue microenvironments and across cell membranes, and relaxation-diffusion correlation to resolve and separately characterize tissue microenvironments in terms of their local chemical composition and microstructure. The shown examples include proof-of-concept measurements on healthy volunteers, pilot investigations of pathologies, and clinical research involving 10-100 subjects. Studied organs include brain, breast, prostate, liver, kidney, placenta, muscle, and peripheral nerve, with examples of pathologies from tumors, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, stroke, neurocysticercosis, pre-eclampsia, and chronic exertional compartment syndrome.

N2  - Purpose: To develop a highly efficient magnetic field gradient coil for head imaging that achieves 200 mT/m and 500 T/m/s on each axis using a standard 1 MVA gradient driver in clinical whole-body 3.0T MR magnet. Method(s): A 42-cm inner diameter head-gradient used the available 89- to 91-cm warm bore space in a whole-body 3.0T magnet by increasing the radial separation between the primary and the shield coil windings to 18.6 cm. This required the removal of the standard whole-body gradient and radiofrequency coils. To achieve a coil efficiency ~4x that of whole-body gradients, a double-layer primary coil design with asymmetric x-y axes, and symmetric z-axis was used. The use of all-hollow conductor with direct fluid cooling of the gradient coil enabled >=50 kW of total heat dissipation. Result(s): This design achieved a coil efficiency of 0.32 mT/m/A, allowing 200 mT/m and 500 T/m/s for a 620 A/1500 V driver. The gradient coil yielded substantially reduced echo spacing, and minimum repetition time and echo time. In high b = 10,000 s/mm2 diffusion, echo time (TE) < 50 ms was achieved (>50% reduction compared with whole-body gradients). The gradient coil passed the American College of Radiology tests for gradient linearity and distortion, and met acoustic requirements for nonsignificant risk operation. Conclusion(s): Ultra-high gradient coil performance was achieved for head imaging without substantial increases in gradient driver power in a whole-body 3.0T magnet after removing the standard gradient coil. As such, any clinical whole-body 3.0T MR system could be upgraded with 3-4x improvement in gradient performance for brain imaging.Copyright © 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

N2  - Peripheral nerves can be affected by a variety of benign and malignant tumour and tumour-like lesions. Besides clinical evaluation and electrophysiologic studies, MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of these soft tissue tumours. Conventional MR sequences, however, can fail to assess the histologic features of the lesions. Moreover, the precise topographical relationship between the peripheral nerve and the tumor must be delineated preoperatively for complete tumour resection minimizing nerve damage. Using Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography, it is possible to obtain functional information on tumour and nerve structures, allowing the assess anatomy, function and biological features. In this article, we review the technical aspects and clinical application of DTI for the evaluation of peripheral nerve tumours. (www.actabiomedica.it).Copyright © 2019, Mattioli 1885.

N2  - Purpose:Hinman syndrome is a rare disease with urodynamic findings and a clinical course resembling neuropathic bladder, without a neuropathic etiology. Diffusion tensor imaging is a special technique of magnetic resonance imaging that has recently been used to evaluate the peripheral nerves but has been demonstrated to be applicable for evaluation of the lumbosacral plexus. We examined the lumbosacral plexus using diffusion tensor imaging, which has not previously been reported in patients with Hinman syndrome.Materials and Methods:The study included 12 patients who fulfilled criteria for Hinman syndrome, with severe bladder dysfunction on urodynamics, renal scarring on scintigraphy and no pathological findings on magnetic resonance imaging. The 12 subjects serving as controls required pelvic or spinal magnetic resonance imaging for reasons other than spinal abnormalities. Evaluation was performed with a 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system and 16-channel body coil. Tractography was done to examine the lumbosacral plexus. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were computed and compared between groups for the right and left plexuses. Result(s):Mean fractional anisotropy was 0.24 and 0.35 for the right plexus in patients and controls, respectively, and 0.24 and 0.36 for the left plexus. Mean diffusivity was 1.39 for the right and left plexuses in patients, and 1.28 for the right and left plexuses in controls (p <0.001 for all). Conclusion(s):Our study focusing on the lumbosacral plexus as a possible origin of neuropathy revealed abnormal findings in patients with Hinman syndrome resembling nerve injury series. This is the first known study to provide data showing that Hinman syndrome may have a neuropathic etiology.Copyright © 2019 by AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, INC.

N2  - Background: Quantitative diffusion MRI is a promising technique for evaluating peripheral nerve integrity but low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede measurement accuracy. Purpose(s): To evaluate principal component analysis (PCA) and generalized spherical deconvolution (genSD) denoising techniques to improve within-subject reproducibility and peripheral nerve conspicuity. Study Type: Prospective. Subjects: Seven healthy volunteers and three peripheral neuropathy patients. Field Strength/Sequence: 3T/multiband single-shot echo planar diffusion sequence using multishell 55-direction scheme. Assessment: Images were processed using four methods: "original" (no denoising), "average" (10 repetitions), "PCA-only," and "PCA + genSD." Tibial and common peroneal nerve segmentations and masks were generated from volunteer diffusion data. Quantitative (SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) values were calculated. Three radiologists qualitatively evaluated nerve conspicuity for each method. The two denoising methods were also performed in three patients with peripheral neuropathies. Statistical Tests: For healthy volunteers, calculations included SNR and CNRFA (computed using FA values). Coefficient of variation (CV%) of CNRFA quantified within-subject reproducibility. Groups were compared with two-sample t-tests (significance P < 0.05; two-tailed, Bonferroni-corrected). Odds ratios (ORs) quantified the relative rates of each of three radiologists confidently identifying a nerve, per slice, for the four methods. Result(s): "PCA + genSD" yielded the highest SNR (meanoverall = 14.83 +/- 1.99) and tibial and common peroneal nerve CNRFA (meantibial = 3.45, meanperoneal = 2.34) compared to "original" (PSNR < 0.001; PCNR = 0.011) and "PCA-only" (PSNR < 0.001, PCNR < 0.001). "PCA + genSD" had higher within-subject reproducibility (low CV%) for tibial (6.04 +/- 1.98) and common peroneal nerves (8.27 +/- 2.75) compared to "original" and "PCA-only." The mean FA was higher for "original" than "average" (P < 0.001), but did not differ significantly between "average" and "PCA + genSD" (P = 0.14). "PCA + genSD" had higher tibial and common peroneal nerve conspicuity than "PCA-only" (ORtibial = 2.50, P < 0.001; ORperoneal = 1.86, P < 0.001) and "original" (ORtibial = 2.73, P < 0.001; ORperoneal = 2.43, P < 0.001). Data Conclusion(s): PCA + genSD denoising method improved SNR, CNRFA, and within-subject reproducibility (CV%) without biasing FA and nerve conspicuity. This technique holds promise for facilitating more reliable, unbiased diffusion measurements of peripheral nerves. Level of Evidence: 2. Technical Efficacy Stage: 1. J. Magn. Reson.

N2  - Imaging studies of peripheral nerves have increased considerably in the last ten years. In addition to the classical and still valid study by ultrasound, new neurographic techniques developed from conventional morphological sequences (including 3 D isotropic studies with fat suppression) are making it possible to assess different peripheral nerves and plexuses, including small sensory and/or motor branches, with great precision. Diffusion-weighted sequences and diffusion tensor imaging have opened a new horizon in neurographic studies. This new approach provides morphological and functional information about the internal structure and pathophysiology of the peripheral nerves and diseases that involve them. This update reviews the different MR neurography techniques available for the study of the peripheral nerves, with special emphasis on new sequences based on diffusion.Copyright © 2019 SERAM

N2  - Objective. The use of a biofabrication nerve scaffold, which mimics the nerve microstructure, as an alternative for autologous nerve transplantation is a promising strategy for treating peripheral nerve defects. This study aimed to design a customized biofabrication scaffold model with the characteristics of human peripheral nerve fascicles. Methods. We used Micro-MRI technique to obtain different nerve fascicles. A full-length 28 cm tibial nerve specimen was obtained and was divided into 14 two-centimetre nerve segments. 3D models of the nerve fascicles were obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction after image segmentation. The central line of the nerve fascicles was fitted, and the aggregation of nerve fascicles was analysed quantitatively. The nerve scaffold was designed by simulating the clinical nerve defect and extracting information from the acquired nerve fascicle data; the scaffold design was displayed by 3D printing to verify the accuracy of the model. Result. The microstructure of the sciatic nerve, tibial nerve, and common peroneal nerve in the nerve fascicles could be obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction. The number of cross fusions of tibial nerve fascicles from proximal end to distal end decreased gradually. By designing the nerve graft in accordance with the microstructure of the nerve fascicles, the 3D printed model demonstrated that the two ends of the nerve defect can be well matched. Conclusion. The microstructure of the nerve fascicles is complicated and changeable, and the spatial position of each nerve fascicle and the long segment of the nerve fascicle aggregation show great changes at different levels. Under the premise of the stability of the existing imaging techniques, a large number of scanning nerve samples can be used to set up a three-dimensional database of the peripheral nerve fascicle microstructure, integrating the gross imaging information, and provide a template for the design of the downstream nerve graft model.Copyright © 2019 Zhi Yao et al.

N2  - Aim: To evaluate if diffusion-tensor-imaging MR-Neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect lesions of peripheral nerves due to polyneuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Method(s): Ten patients with type 2 diabetes with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 patients with type 2 diabetes without polyneuropathy (nDPN) as well as 20 healthy controls (HC) were included. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions (tibial nerve) of the lower extremity. Fractional-anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity (mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD)) were calculated and compared to neuropathy severity. Conventional T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density data were obtained from a multi-echo SE sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity of DTI-MRN from receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Result(s): The proximal and distal FA was lowest in patients with DPN compared with nDPN and HC (p < 0.01). Likewise, proximal and distal RD was highest in patients with DPN (p < 0.01). MD and AD were also significantly different though less pronounced. ROC curve analyses of DTI separated nDPN and DPN with area-under-the-curve values ranging from 0.65 to 0.98. T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density could not differentiate between nDPN and DPN. Conclusion(s): DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher RD. These alterations are likely to reflect both proximal and distal nerve fiber pathology in patients with type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Although diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) has long been considered a disease of the peripheral nervous system, recent neuroimaging studies have shown that alterations in the central nervous system may play a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Here, we used surface-based morphometry (SBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to investigate gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) differences between patients with DPN (n = 67, 44 painless and 23 painful) and healthy controls (HCs; n = 88). Compared with HCs, patients with DPN exhibited GM abnormalities in the pre- and postcentral gyrus and in several deep GM nuclei (caudate, putamen, medial pallidum, thalamus, and ventral nuclear). They also exhibited altered WM tracts (corticospinal tract, spinothalamic tract, and thalamocortical projecting fibers). These findings suggest impaired motor and somatosensory pathways in DPN. Further, patients with DPN (particularly painful DPN) exhibited morphological differences in the cingulate, insula, prefrontal cortex, and thalamus, as well as impaired WM integrity in periaqueductal WM and internal and external capsules. This suggests pain-perception/modulation pathways are altered in painful DPN. Intermodal correlation analyses found that the morphological indices of the brain regions identified by the SBM analysis were significantly correlated with the fractional anisotropy of brain regions identified by the TBSS analysis, suggesting that the GM and WM alterations were tightly coupled. Overall, our study showed sensorimotor and pain-related GM and WM alterations in patients with DPN, which might be involved in the development of DPN.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - Nerve regeneration after injury must occur in a timely fashion to restore function. Unfortunately, current methods (e.g., electrophysiology) provide limited information following trauma, resulting in delayed management and suboptimal outcomes. Herein, we evaluated the ability of diffusion MRI to monitor nerve regeneration after injury/repair. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three treatment groups (sham=21, crush=23, cut/repair=19) and ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was performed 1-12 weeks post-surgery. Behavioral data showed a distinction between crush and cut/repair nerves at 4 weeks. This was consistent with DTI, which found that thresholds based on the ratio of radial and axial diffusivities (RD/AD=0.40+/-0.02) and fractional anisotropy (FA=0.53+/-0.01) differentiated crush from cut/repair injuries. By the 12th week, cut/repair nerves whose behavioral data indicated a partial recovery were below the RD/AD threshold (and above the FA threshold), while nerves that did not recover were on the opposite side of each threshold. Additional morphometric analysis indicated that DTI-derived normalized scalar indices report on axon density (RD/AD: r=-0.54, p<1e-3; FA: r=0.56, p<1e-3). Interestingly, higher-order DKI analyses did not improve our ability classify recovery. These findings suggest that DTI may provide promising biomarkers for distinguishing successful/unsuccessful nerve repairs and potentially identify cases that require reoperation.

N2  - Assessment of myelin integrity in peripheral nerve injuries and pathologies has largely been limited to post-mortem analysis owing to the difficulty in obtaining biopsies without affecting nerve function. This is further encumbered by the small size of the tissue and its location. Therefore, the development of robust, non-invasive methods is highly attractive. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), to longitudinally and non-invasively characterize both the sciatic nerve crush and lysolecithin (LCP) demyelination models of peripheral nerve injury in rodents. Electrophysiological, gene expression and histological assessments complemented the extensive MRI analyses in young and aged animals. In the nerve crush model, MTR analysis indicated a slower recovery in regions distal to the site of injury in aged animals, as well as incomplete recovery at six weeks post-crush when analyzing across the entire nerve surface. Similar regional impairments were also found in the LCP demyelination model. This research underlines the power of MTR for the study of peripheral nerve injury in small tissues such as the sciatic nerve of rodents and contributes new knowledge to the effect of aging on recovery after injury. A particular advantage of the approach is the translational potential to human neuropathies.

N2  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is increasingly being used in magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). The purpose of this study was to determine the interreader and test-retest reliability of peripheral nerve DTI in MRN with focus on the sciatic nerve. Method(s): In this prospective study 27 healthy volunteers each underwent 3 scans of a short DTI protocol on separate days consisting of a T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and single-shot DTI sequence of the sciatic nerve of the dominant leg. The DTI parameters fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were obtained after manual nerve segmentation by two independent readers. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and Bland-Altman plots were calculated as measures for both interreader and test-retest agreement for all readout parameters. Result(s): The mean+/- standard deviation was 0.507+/- 0.05 for FA, 1308.5+/- 162.4x 10-6mm2/s for MD, 905.6+/- 145.4x10-6mm2/s for RD and 2114.1+/- 219.2x 10-6mm2/s for AD. The SEM for FA was 0.02 for interreader and test-retest agreement, the SEM for MD, RD, and AD ranged between 46.2x 10-6mm2/s (RD) and 70.1x 10-6mm2/s (AD) for interreader reliability and between 45.9x 10-6mm2/s (RD) and 70.1x 10-6mm2/s (AD) for test-retest reliability. The ICC for interreader reliability of DTI parameters ranged between 0.81 and 0.92 and ICC for test-retest reliability between 0.76 and 0.91. Conclusion(s): Peripheral nerve DTI of the sciatic nerve is reliable and reproducible. The measures presented here may serve as first orientation values of measurement accuracy when interpreting parameters of sciatic nerve DTI.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries has classically been based on clinical and electrophysiologic criteria. US and MRI have been widely used for morphologic assessment of nerve injury sites and concomitant lesions. In the past few years, morphologic MR neurography has significantly increased its clinical applications on the basis of three-dimensional or two-dimensional images with and without fat-suppression techniques. However, these sequences have a major drawback: absence of pathophysiologic information about functional integrity or axonal flow of peripheral nerves. In this scenario, functional MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used as a complementary tool in initial evaluation of peripheral nerve trauma or in assessment of trauma undergoing surgical repair. These approaches provide not only morphologic but also functional information about extent and degree of nerve impairment. Functional MR neurography can also be applied to selection, planning, and monitoring of surgical procedures that can be performed after traumatic peripheral nerve injuries, such as neurorrhaphy, nerve graft, or neurolysis, as it provides surgeons with valuable information about the functional status of the nerves involved and axonal flow integrity. The physical basis of DWI and DTI and the technical adjustments required for their appropriate performance for peripheral nerve evaluation are reviewed. Also, the clinical value of DWI and DTI in assessment of peripheral nerve trauma is discussed, enhancing their potential impact on selection, planning, and monitoring of surgical procedures employed for peripheral nerve repair.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the discriminative power of radiomics of peripheral nerves at 1.5T MRI, using common entrapment neuropathies of the upper limb as a model system of focal nerve injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiomics was retrospectively done on peripheral nerve fascicles on T1-weighted 1.5T MRI of 40 patients with diagnosis of mild carpal (n=25) and cubital tunnel (n=15) syndrome and of 200 controls. Z-score normalization and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare features of normal and pathological peripheral nerves. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. RESULT(S): A total of n=104 radiomics features were computed for each patient and control. Significant differences between normal and pathological median and ulnar nerves were found in n=23/104 features (p<0.001). According to features classification, n=5/23 features were shape-based, n=7/23 were first-order features, n=11/23 features were classified as gray level run length matrix. Nine of the selected features showed an AUC higher that 0.7: minimum AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.61-0.89) for sum variance and maximum AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-0.99) for zone entropy. CONCLUSION(S): Features analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences between normal and pathological nerve. The results suggested that radiomics analysis could assess the median and ulnar nerve inner structure changes due to the loss of the fascicular pattern, intraneural edema, fibrosis or fascicular alterations in mild carpal tunnel and mild cubital tunnel syndromes even when the nerve cross-sectional area does not change.

N2  - Purpose of Review: Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used as a problem-solving tool for diagnosis and management of peripheral neuropathies. This review is aimed at summarizing important technological advances, including MR pulse sequence and surface coil developments, which have facilitated MRN's use in clinical practice. Recent Findings: The most recent research in MRN focuses on its clinical applications, with concomitant development of three-dimensional, parallel imaging and vascular suppression techniques that facilitate higher spatial resolution and depiction of small nerve branches arising from the brachial and lumbosacral plexi as well as fascicular abnormalities of more distal extremity nerves. Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been studied as a tool to detect microstructural abnormalities of peripheral nerves and more precisely define grades of nerve injury but will require additional investigation to determine its role in daily clinical practice. Summary: MRN continues to evolve due to technological improvements and awareness by the medical community of its capabilities. Additional technological developments related to surface coil designs and vascular suppression techniques will be needed to move the field forward.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Abstract: Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) account for ~ 5% of soft tissue neoplasms and are responsible for a wide spectrum of morbidities ranging from localized neuropathy to fulminant metastatic spread and death. MR imaging represents the gold standard for identification of these neoplasms, however, current anatomic MR imaging markers do not reliably detect or differentiate benign and malignant lesions, and therefore, biopsy or excision is required for definitive diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) serves as a useful tool in the evaluation and management of PNSTs by providing functional information regarding the degree of diffusion, while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) aids in determining the directional information of predominant diffusion and has been shown to be particularly useful for pre-operative planning of these tumors by delineating healthy and pathologic fascicles. The article focuses on these important neurogenic lesions, highlighting the current utility of diffusion MR imaging and future directions including computerized radiomic analysis. Key Points: * Anatomic MRI is moderately accurate in differentiating benign from malignant PNST. * Diffusion tensor imaging facilitates pre-operative planning of PNSTs by depicting neuropathy and tractography. * Radiomics will likely augment current observer-based diagnostic criteria for PNSTs.Copyright © 2018, European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Purpose: To examine dorsal root ganglia and proximal nerve segments in patients carrying the Fabry-related GLA-gene variant p.D313Y in comparison to patients with classical Fabry mutations and healthy controls by morphometric and functional magnetic resonance neurography. Method(s): This prospective multicenter study examines the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve in 11 female p.D313Y patients by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3 T. Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3 to S2, permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1, and spinal nerve L5 as well as cross-sectional area of the sciatic nerve were assessed and compared to 10 females carrying a classical Fabry mutation and 16 healthy female controls. Result(s): Compared to healthy controls, dorsal root ganglia volumes of p.D313Y females were enlarged by 53% (L3), 48% (L4), 43% (L5), 57% (S1) (p < 0.001), and 55% (S2) (p < 0.05), but less pronounced compared to females carrying a classical Fabry mutation. Compared to healthy controls, p.D313Y patients showed no changes of dorsal root ganglia vascular permeability, while patients with a classical Fabry mutation showed a distinct decrease (p < 0.05). Sciatic nerve cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6% in p.D313Y as well as in classical Fabry patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Patients carrying the GLA-gene variant p.D313Y show distinctly enlarged dorsal root ganglia, while vascular permeability remains within normal limits. Overall, these alterations partially share characteristics commonly seen in patients with a mutation causing classical FD. This suggests that p.D313Y causes a potentially treatable condition resembling an early stage of Fabry disease.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: This study explores whether objective, quantitative radiomic biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance (MR), positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT) may be useful in reliably distinguishing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN). Method(s): A registration and segmentation pipeline was established using a cohort of NF1 patients with histopathological diagnosis of PN or MPNST, and medical imaging of the PN including MR and PET-CT. The corrected MR datasets were registered to the corresponding PET-CT via landmark-based registration. PET standard-uptake value (SUV) thresholds were used to guide segmentation of volumes of interest: MPNST-associated PET-hot regions (SUV >= 3.5) and PN-associated PET-elevated regions (2.0 < SUV < 3.5). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from the MR, PET, and CT data and compared for statistical differences. Intensity histogram features included (mean, media, maximum, variance, full width at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and skewness), while image texture was quantified using Law's texture energy measures, grey-level co-occurrence matrices, and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices. Result(s): For each of the 20 NF1 subjects, a total of 320 features were extracted from the image data. Feature reduction and statistical testing identified 9 independent radiomic biomarkers from the MR data (4 intensity and 5 texture) and 4 PET (2 intensity and 2 texture) were different between the PET-hot versus PET-elevated volumes of interest. Conclusion(s): Our data suggests imaging features can be used to distinguish malignancy in NF1-realted tumors, which could improve MPNST risk assessment and positively impact clinical management of NF1 patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Background: Diagnosis and disease monitoring of non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN) are based on electrophysiological and clinical measures. However, these methods are insensitive to detect subtle differences of axonal injury. We here assessed the utility of a multiparametric MRI protocol to quantify axonal injury and neurogenic muscle damage in NSVN. Method(s): Ten NSVN patients and ten age-matched controls were investigated in this single-center prospective study. All participants were assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the tibial nerve and multiecho Dixon MRI of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. These data were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological data. Result(s): DTI scans of the tibial nerves of patients with NSVN showed significantly lower mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values (0.32 +/- 0.02) compared to healthy controls (0.42 +/- 0.01). FA values of NSVN patients correlated negatively with clinical measures of pain. Multiecho Dixon MRI scans revealed significantly higher intramuscular fat fractions in the soleus muscle (19.86 +/- 6.18% vs. 5.86 +/- 0.74%, p = 0.0015) and gastrocnemius muscle (26.09 +/- 6.21% vs. 3.59 +/- 0.82%, p = 0.0002) in NSVN patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusion(s): Our data provide a proof of concept that MRI can render information about nerve integrity and muscle pathology in NSVN. Further studies are warranted to evaluate DTI and multiecho Dixon MRI as surrogate markers in NSVN.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: The development of a noninvasive, objective, and accurate method to assess peripheral nerve disorders in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is of clinical significance. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to evaluate some peripheral nerve disorders. Purpose(s): To investigate the feasibility of DTI in evaluating the peripheral nerve disorders in patients with GBS. Study Type: Case control. Subjects: Twenty GBS patients and 16 healthy volunteers. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T, T1WI-SE, T2WI-SPAIR, DTI; electrophysiology. Assessment: MRI data were analyzed by two radiologists blindly and independently. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusion coefficient (AD), and radial diffusion coefficient (RD) values of tibial nerve (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were recorded. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) and motor nerve conduction amplitude of TN and CPN were recorded. Statistical Tests: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), t-test, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC) analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient. Result(s): The FA and AD values of TN and CPN in the GBS group were significantly lower and the ADC and RD values were higher than those in the controls (P <0.05). The AUC of the FA values (0.970 for TN and 0.927 for CPN) were higher than that of the ADC, AD, and RD values. FA and AD values were positively correlated and ADC, RD values were negatively correlated with MCV and motor nerve conduction amplitude, respectively (P <0.05).

N2  - Purpose: Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is seen in up to 75% of treated cancer patients and can drastically limit their medical management and affect quality of life. Clinical and electrodiagnostic testing for CIPN have many pitfalls. Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used in the evaluation of peripheral nerves. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows promise in the workup of peripheral nerves. In this prospective pilot study, we investigated a possible relationship between DTI and peripheral neuropathy of the ankle and foot in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Method(s): Nine cancer patients with and without CIPN were clinically evaluated using vibratory perception threshold (VPT) testing. VPT score of >25 Volts defined presence of CIPN. The posterior tibial nerve and branches in both feet were imaged using MRN and DTI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured at the posterior tibial, medial plantar, and lateral plantar nerves. Measurements for the CIPN group were compared to without CIPN by VPT cutoff. Correlations and possible relationships between DTI parameters and CIPN were analyzed. Result(s): A total of 16 feet of 9 enrolled patients were imaged (9 feet with CIPN and 7 feet without CIPN). Average age was 60.6 +/- 13.4 years (range: 33-74). Posterior tibial nerve ADC values were significantly lower than the medial plantar nerve ADC values in all feet (F = 3.50, P = 0.04). We found a correlation with FA and ADC values at specific nerve locations with CIPN, with the left medial plantar nerve FA value and left lateral plantar nerve ADC value demonstrating the strongest positive correlations (0.73 and 0.62, respectively). Conclusion(s): The use of DTI for assessing CIPN is challenging but promising. This pilot study provides preliminary data showing correlations between FA and ADC measurements with CIPN and potential utility of DTI as a predictive marker of onset and severity of CIPN in the ankle and foot, which could aid in preventive strategies. Larger, prospective DTI studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Clinical Relevance: MRN with DTI shows promising results as a potential predictive marker of CIPN in the ankle and foot.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: By applying diffusor tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with anterior interosseous nerve syndrome (AINS), this proof of principle study aims to quantify the extent of structural damage of a peripheral nerve at the anatomical level of individual fascicles. Method(s): In this institutional review board approved prospective study 13 patients with spontaneous AINS were examined at 3 Tesla including a transversal T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo and a spin-echo echo-planar-imaging pulse sequence of the upper arm level. Calculations of quantitative DTI parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) for median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles as well as ulnar and radial nerve were obtained. DTI values were compared to each other and to a previously published dataset of 58 healthy controls using one-way Analysis of Variance with Bonferroni correction and p-values <.05 were considered significant. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to assess diagnostic accuracy. Result(s): FA of median nerve lesion fascicles was decreased compared to median nerve non-lesion fascicles, ulnar nerve and radial nerve while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p <.001 for all parameters). Compared to median nerve values of healthy controls, lesion fascicles showed a significant decrease in FA while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p <.001 for all parameters). FA of median nerve non-lesion fascicles showed a weak significant decrease compared to healthy controls (p <.01) while there was no difference in MD, RD, and AD. ROC analyses revealed an excellent diagnostic accuracy of FA, MD and RD in the discrimination of median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles in AINS patients as well as in the discrimination of lesion fascicles and normative median nerve values of healthy controls. Conclusion(s): By applying this functional MR Neurography technique in patients with AINS, this proof of principle study demonstrates that diffusion tensor imaging is feasible to quantify structural nerve injury at the anatomical level of individual fascicles.Copyright © 2019 The Authors

N2  - Background: Peripheral nerve injury is often followed by a highly variable recovery process with respect to both rapidity and efficacy. Identifying post-nerve injury phenomena is key to assessing the merit and timing of surgery as well as to tracking nerve recovery postoperatively. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has been investigated in the clinical and research settings as a noninvasive technique to both assess and monitor each patient's unique case of peripheral nerve damage. New method: We identify a MRI-suitable marker for tracking the exact site of either nerve injury or coaptation following surgical repair to aid with DTI analysis. Result(s): Due to artefact and disruption of tractography, silver wire and microvascular clips were not suitable markers. AxoGuard 4-0 vicryl suture, and 10-0 polyamide suture, although detectable, did not produce a signal easily distinguished from post-surgical changes. Silicone was easily identifiable and stable in both the acute and delayed time points, exhibited negligible impact on DTI parameters, and possessed geometry to prevent nerve strangulation. Comparison with existing method: Prior studies have not assessed the efficacy of other markers nor have they assessed silicone for potential artefact with DTI parameter analysis. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the reliability and compatibility of silicone in the delayed postoperative time period and includes its unique imaging appearance on high-resolution 11.7 MRI. Conclusion(s): Semi-cylindrical silicone tubing can be used as a safe, reliable, and readily available radiological marker to visualize and monitor a region of interest on a rodent's peripheral nerve for aiding assessments with diffusion tensor imaging.Copyright © 2018

N2  - Due to the technical challenges of large-scale microscopy and analysis, to date only limited knowledge has been made available about axon morphometry (diameter, shape, myelin thickness, volume fraction), thereby limiting our understanding of neuronal microstructure and slowing down research on neurodegenerative pathologies. This study addresses this knowledge gap by establishing a state-of-the-art acquisition and analysis framework for mapping axon morphometry, and providing the first comprehensive mapping of axon morphometry in the human spinal cord. We dissected, fixed and stained a human spinal cord with osmium tetroxide, and used a scanning electron microscope to image the entirety of 23 axial slices, covering C1 to L5 spinal levels. An automatic method based on deep learning was then used to segment each axon and myelin sheath to produce maps of axon morphometry. These maps were then registered to a standard spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) template. Between 500,000 (lumbar) and 1 million (cervical) myelinated axons were segmented at each level of this human spinal cord. Morphometric features show a large disparity between tracts, but high right-left symmetry. Our results suggest a modality-based organization of the dorsal column in the human, as it has been observed in the rat. The generated axon morphometry template is publicly available at https://osf.io/8k7jr/ and could be used as a reference for quantitative MRI studies. The proposed framework for axon morphometry mapping could be extended to other parts of the central or peripheral nervous system that exhibit coherently-oriented axons.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - ObjectiveTo characterize and quantify peripheral nerve lesions and muscle degeneration in clinically, genetically, and electrophysiologically well-classified, nonpediatric patients with 5q-linked spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN).MethodsThirty-one adult patients with genetically confirmed 5q-linked SMA types II, IIIa, and IIIb and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were prospectively investigated. All patients received neurologic, physiotherapeutic, and electrophysiologic assessments. MRN at 3.0T with anatomic coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to the tibiotalar joint was performed with dual-echo 2D relaxometry sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3D T2-weighted inversion recovery sequence. Detailed quantification of nerve injury by morphometric and microstructural MRN markers and qualitative classification of fatty muscle degeneration were conducted.ResultsEstablished clinical scores and compound muscle action potentials discriminated well between the 3 SMA types. MRN revealed that peroneal and tibial nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) at the thigh and lower leg level as well as spinal nerve CSA were markedly decreased throughout all 3 groups, indicating severe generalized peripheral nerve atrophy. While peroneal and tibial nerve T2 relaxation time was distinctly increased at all analyzed anatomic regions, the proton spin density was clearly decreased. Marked differences in fatty muscle degeneration were found between the 3 groups and for all analyzed compartments.ConclusionsMRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve involvement in SMA types II, IIIa, and IIIb with high sensitivity in vivo. Quantitative MRN parameters (T2 relaxation time proton spin density, CSA) might serve as novel imaging biomarkers in SMA to indicate early microstructural nerve tissue changes in response to treatment.Copyright © American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Purpose: To establish normal values and to identify demographic determinants of quantitative biomarkers in magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Method(s): In this study 60 healthy individuals (5 men and 5 women of every decade between 20 and 80 years) were examined according to a standardized MRN protocol at 3 T, including multiecho T2 relaxometry. Nerve cross-sectional area (CSA), transverse relaxation time (T2), and proton spin density (PSD) were assessed for the sciatic, tibial, median, ulnar, and radial nerves. Correlation with demographic variables, such as height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and age was expressed by Pearson coefficients and t-tests were used to compare MRN biomarkers between men and women with and without normalization to body weight and BMI by linear regression. Result(s): The average nerve CSA correlated moderately with height (r = 0.28, p = 0.04), weight (r = 0.40, p = 0.002), and BMI (r = 0.35, p = 0.008), but not with age (r = 0.23, p = 0.09). While T2 did not correlate with demographic parameters, PSD was strongly inversely associated with BMI (r = -0.64, p < 0.001) and weight (r = -0.557, p < 0.001). Sex-dependent differences in imaging marker values were found for CSA but became negligible after normalization to body weight. Conclusion(s): Quantitative biomarkers of MRN co-vary with demographic variables. As particularly important determinants, we identified body weight for nerve CSA and BMI for PSD. The presented normal values and demographic determinants may assist investigations into the potential of MRN biomarkers in further disease-specific studies.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

N2  - Electroacupuncture (EA) is an adjuvant therapy for peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Both peripheral and central alterations contribute to the rehabilitation process. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the diffusion plasticity of afferent and efferent pathways caused by EA in model of peripheral nerve injury and reparation. Twenty-four rats were divided into three groups: normal group, model group and intervention group. Rats of the model group and the intervention group underwent sciatic nerve transection and anastomosis. EA intervention was performed on the intervention group at ST-36 and GB-30 for three months. Gait assessment and DTI were conducted at days post-operative (DPO) 30, 60 and 90. We selected corticospinal tract, spinothalamic tract and internal capsule as regions of interest and analyzed diffusion metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). FA values and RD values displayed significant differences or obvious tendency while AD values maintained a stable level. RD values displayed better indicative performance than FA in internal capsule. The intervention group presented significant correlation between RD values and Regularity Index (RI) during the intervention period. The effect of EA on peripheral nerve injury repairing rats appeared to be accelerated recovery process of sensory and motor neural pathway. We proposed that RD was a potential in vivo indicator for structural plasticity caused by EA and PNI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

T1  - Update on classification, epidemiology, clinical phenotype and imaging of the nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathies

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Purpose of reviewSingle-organ vasculitis of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is often designated nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN). Several variants or subtypes have been distinguished, including migratory sensory neuropathy, postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy, diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies, skin-nerve vasculitides, and, arguably, neuralgic amyotrophy. NSVN often presents as nondiabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (LRPN). This review updates classification, clinical features, epidemiology, and imaging of these disorders.Recent findingsA recent study showed the annual incidence of LRPN in Olmstead County, Minnesota to be 4.16/100000:2.79/100000 diabetic and 1.27/100000 nondiabetic. This study was the first to determine the incidence or prevalence of any vasculitic neuropathy. In NSVN, ultrasonography shows multifocal enlargement of proximal and distal nerves. In neuralgic amyotrophy, MRI and ultrasound reveal multifocal enlargements and focal constrictions in nerves derived from the brachial plexus. Histopathology of these chronic lesions shows inflammation and rare vasculitis. Diffusion tensor imaging of tibial nerves in NSVN revealed decreased fractional anisotropy in one study.SummarySingle-organ PNS vasculitides are the most common inflammatory neuropathies. Neuralgic amyotrophy might result from PNS vasculitis, but further study is necessary. The usefulness of focal nerve enlargements or constrictions in understanding pathological mechanisms, directing biopsies, and monitoring disease activity in NSVN should be further investigated.Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established tool in probing cortical plasticity in vivo. Changes in corticomotor excitability can be induced using paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which TMS over the primary motor cortex is conditioned with an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the contralateral hand. PAS with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms induces long-term potentiation (LTP)like effects in cortical excitability. However, the response to a PAS protocol tends to vary substantially across individuals. In this study, we used univariate and multivariate data-driven methods to investigate various previously proposed determinants of inter-individual variability in PAS efficacy, such as demographic, cognitive, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging measures. Forty-one right-handed participants, comprising 22 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 19 healthy controls (HC), underwent the PAS protocol. Prior to stimulation, demographic, genetic, clinical, as well as structural and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The two groups did not differ in any of the variables, except by global cognitive status. Univariate analysis showed that only 61% of all participants were classified as PAS responders, irrespective of group membership. Higher PAS response was associated with lower TMS intensity and with higher resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, but only in responders, as opposed to non-responders. We also found an overall positive correlation between PAS response and structural connectivity within the corticospinal tract, which did not differ between groups. A multivariate random forest (RF) model identified age, gender, education, IQ, global cognitive status, sleep quality, alertness, TMS intensity, genetic factors, and neuroimaging measures (functional and structural connectivity, gray matter (GM) volume, and cortical thickness as poor predictors of PAS response. The model resulted in low accuracy of the RF classifier (58%; 95% CI: 42 - 74%), with a higher relative importance of brain connectivity measures compared to the other variables. We conclude that PAS variability in our sample was not well explained by factors known to influence PAS efficacy, emphasizing the need for future replication studies.Copyright © 2019 Minkova, Peter, Abdulkadir, Schumacher, Kaller, Nissen, Kloppel and Lahr.

N2  - Objective: In this study we investigated the potential value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in characterizing changes in the cervical spinal cord and peripheral nerve roots in vivo in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Method(s): We developed an MRI protocol with 4 sequences to investigate the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots on a 3 Tesla MRI system. We used 2 anatomical MRI sequences to investigate cross-sectional area (CSA) at each spinal segment and the diameter of ventral and dorsal nerve roots, and two diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques to estimate the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in 10 SMA patients and 20 healthy controls. Result(s): There were no significant differences in CSA (p > .1), although an 8.5% reduction of CSA in patients compared to healthy controls was apparent at segment C7. DTI data showed a higher AD in grey matter of patients compared to healthy controls (p = .033). Significantly lower MD, AD and RD values were found in rostral nerve roots (C3-C5) in patients (p < .045). Conclusion(s): We showed feasibility of an advanced 3 T MRI protocol that allowed differences to be determined between patients and healthy controls, confirming the potential of this technique to assess pathological mechanisms in SMA. After further development and confirmation of findings in a larger sample, these techniques may be used to study disease course of SMA in vivo and evaluate response to survival motor neuron (SMN) augmenting therapy.Copyright © 2019

N2  - Background: Diabetic neuropathy is the commonest chronic disabling complication of diabetes which may lead to amputation and compromising patient's quality of life. It is characterized by pain, sensation loss associated with neural edema. Diffusion tensor imaging parameter i.e. fraction anisotropy determines the free water proton diffusion in the healthy nerve. Since the diabetes leads to altered mechanosensitivity of the posterior tibial nerve thereby, might interferes with the water molecules movement. Therefore the present clinical trial will provide the evidence of improving the diffusion tensor imaging in the diabetic neuropathy directly by targeting the nerve through nerve mobilization treatment. Method(s): Participants with Type II Diabetes Mellitus induced peripheral neuropathy will be selected randomly on the basis of eligibility criteria and informed consent will be taken. Participants will be recruited into three groups. Group A (experimental group A) will receive neural mobilization technique, Group B (experimental group B) will receive conventional therapy and Group C (control group) will receive sham treatment for 3 weeks. MRI technique, Visual analogue scale and neuropathy specific quality of life questionnaire will be used as assessment tools. Assessment will be taken at baseline and post intervention. Conclusion(s): this clinical trial will provide the evidence of efficacy of nerve mobilization in determining the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes in the posterior tibial nerve in patients with diabetic neuropathy. This trial will also be the first one in itself to look at the treatment induced DTI changes in the peripheral nerve.

N2  - Purpose: Hinman syndrome is a rare disease with urodynamic findings and a clinical course resembling neuropathic bladder, without a neuropathic etiology. Diffusion tensor imaging is a special technique of magnetic resonance imaging that has recently been used to evaluate the peripheral nerves but has been demonstrated to be applicable for evaluation of the lumbosacral plexus. We examined the lumbosacral plexus using diffusion tensor imaging, which has not previously been reported in patients with Hinman syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 12 patients who fulfilled criteria for Hinman syndrome, with severe bladder dysfunction on urodynamics, renal scarring on scintigraphy and no pathological findings on magnetic resonance imaging. The 12 subjects serving as controls required pelvic or spinal magnetic resonance imaging for reasons other than spinal abnormalities. Evaluation was performed with a 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system and 16-channel body coil. Tractography was done to examine the lumbosacral plexus. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were computed and compared between groups for the right and left plexuses. Result(s): Mean fractional anisotropy was 0.24 and 0.35 for the right plexus in patients and controls, respectively, and 0.24 and 0.36 for the left plexus. Mean diffusivity was 1.39 for the right and left plexuses in patients, and 1.28 for the right and left plexuses in controls (p <0.001 for all). Conclusion(s): Our study focusing on the lumbosacral plexus as a possible origin of neuropathy revealed abnormal findings in patients with Hinman syndrome resembling nerve injury series. This is the first known study to provide data showing that Hinman syndrome may have a neuropathic etiology.Copyright © 2019 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

T1  - Evaluation of Brachial Plexus Using Combined Stereological Techniques of Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Fiber Tracking
A1  - Acer, Niyazi

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Background Brachial plexus (BP) is composed of intercommunications among the ventral roots of the nerves C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 in the neck. The in vivo and in vitro evaluation of axons of the peripheral nervous system is performed using different techniques. Recently, many studies describing the application of fiber tractography and stereological axon number estimation to peripheral nerves have been published. Methods Various quantitative parameters of nerve fibers, including axon number, density, axonal area, and myelin thickness, can be estimated using stereological techniques. In vivo three-dimensional reconstruction of axons of BP can be visualized using a combined technique of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tracking with the potential to evaluate nerve fiber content. Conclusion It is concluded that terminal branches of BP can be successfully visualized using DTI, which is a highly reproducible method for the evaluation of BP as it shows anatomical and functional features of neural structures. We believe that quantitative morphological findings obtained from BP will be useful for new experimental, developmental, and pathological studies in the future.Copyright © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.

N2  - Background: One of the main goals of novel, noninvasive imaging techniques like high-resolution nerve ultrasound (HRUS) and corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) is the prediction of treatment response for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Method(s): A total of 17 patients with CIDP were examined prospectively at baseline and every 9 months over a period of 18 months using CCM to quantify corneal nerve degeneration markers and immune cell infiltration as well as HRUS to detect changes of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the peripheral nerves. Additionally, skin biopsy of the distal and proximal leg as well as quantitative sensory testing were performed at the first follow-up visit. Result(s): A value of more than 30 total corneal cells/mm2 in CCM at baseline identified patients with clinical progression with a sensitivity/specificity of 100% in our cohort. Corneal nerve fiber density and length remained low and stable over the study period and intra-epidermal fiber density was markedly reduced in the majority of the patients. Furthermore, an increase in Bochum ultrasound score (BUS), which summarizes the CSA of the ulnar nerve in Guyons' canal, the ulnar nerve in the upper arm, the radial nerve in the spiral groove and the sural nerve between the gastrocnemius muscle, and a maximum BUS of 4 at study initiation identified patients with disease progression (sensitivity 80%, specificity 88%). Conclusion(s): BUS and corneal total cell infiltration seem to represent early markers for clinical progression in CIDP, thus having the potential to identify at-risk patients and impact treatment decisions.Copyright © The Author(s), 2019.

N2  - European Radiology Experimental reached the first 100 articles published in two years. Rejection rate was 30%, publication rate increased from 3.5/month in the first 12-month period to 4.8/month in the second 12-month period. The journal metrics were: 25 days from submission to first decision, 96 days from submission to acceptance, and 69 days from acceptance to publication. At the end of May 2019, we accumulated a total of 82,367 article accesses, 541 Altmetric score, and 110 citations for 92 published articles. Europe accounted for 85% of article origin. One third of corresponding authors were not radiologists/radiology residents, but were rather mainly physicists, engineers, or computer scientists. The distribution among subspecialties/body parts was well balanced; 9% of the topics regarded patient's safety, radioprotection, or contrast media. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) accounted for 71% of the articles. Twenty-two percent of original articles/technical notes reported on animal models, 15% on phantoms, 3% on in silico, 2% on human cadavers, and 2% on cells. Nine articles regarded artificial intelligence and/or radiomics, and 2 regarded augmented reality. Of 100 articles, 57 declared funding sources. A total of 517 independent reviews were performed by 92 reviewers. The five articles quoted the most regarded augmented reality, spectral photon-counting CT, artificial intelligence, MRI radiomics, and diffusion tensor imaging of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems. The journal is complying with aims and scope of its "experimental" profile.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).

N2  - Schwannomatosis is a distinct syndrome characterized by multiple peripheral nerve schwannomas that can be sporadic or familial in nature. Cases affecting the lower cranial nerves are infrequent. Here, the authors present a rare case of schwannomatosis affecting the left spinal accessory nerve. Upon genetic screening, an in-frame insertion at codon p.R177 of the Sox 10 gene was observed. There were no identifiable alterations in NF1, NF2, LZTR1, and SMARCB1. This case demonstrates a rare clinical presentation of schwannomatosis in addition to a genetic aberration that has not been previously reported in this disease context.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart.

N2  - Purpose: MR neurography is known to be useful to evaluate nerve pathology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with nerve-sheath signal increased with inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of relaxation enhancement imaging (SHINKEI) to distinguish patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) from healthy subjects. Material(s) and Method(s): This retrospective study included 13 patients with CIDP and five healthy subjects from 2015 to 2017. The T2 relaxation time and the size of the cervical ganglia and roots of the brachial plexus were measured. Statistical analyses were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Result(s): The T2 relaxation times of the ganglia and roots were longer in patients with CIDP (119.31 +/- 35.53 msec and 111.15 +/- 33.82 msec) than in healthy subjects (101.42 +/- 26.42 msec and 85.29 +/- 13.22 msec, P = 0.0007 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The sizes of the ganglia and the roots were larger in patients with CIDP (6.25 +/- 1.56 mm and 4.37 +/- 1.71 mm) than in healthy subjects (5.59 +/- 1.08 mm and 3.50 +/- 0.62 mm, P = 0.0114 and P = 0.0014, respectively). ROC analysis revealed that T2 relaxation time of the roots was best at distinguishing CIDP patients from healthy subjects (the area under the curve = 0.748). Conclusion(s): Patients with CIDP could be distinguished from healthy subjects using simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with SHINKEI.Copyright © 2018

N2  - Background. We sought to determine the value of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for characterization of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Methods. Twenty-six patients with NF1 and suspicion of malignant transformation of PNSTs were prospectively enrolled and underwent DW MRI at 3T. For a set of benign (n = 55) and malignant (n = 12) PNSTs, functional MRI parameters were derived from both biexponential intravoxel incoherent motion (diffusion coefficient D and perfusion fraction f) and monoexponential data analysis (apparent diffusion coefficients [ADCs]). A panel of morphological MRI features was evaluated using T1- and T2-weighted imaging. Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher's exact test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative and qualitative MRI. Cohen's kappa was used to determine interrater reliability. Results. Malignant PNSTs demonstrated significantly lower diffusivity (P < 0.0001) compared with benign PNSTs. The perfusion fraction f was significantly higher in malignant PNSTs (P < 0.001). In ROC analysis, functional MRI parameters showed high diagnostic accuracy for differentiation of PNSTs (eg, ADCmean, 92% sensitivity with 98% specificity, AUC 0.98; Dmean, 92% sensitivity with 98% specificity, AUC 0.98). By contrast, morphological imaging features had only limited sensitivity (18-94%) and specificity (18-82%) for identification of malignancy. Interrater reliability was higher for monoexponential data analysis. Conclusion. DW imaging shows better diagnostic performance than morphological features and allows accurate differentiation of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1.Copyright © 2019 Society for Neuro-Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

N2  - Background: The treatment efficacy after CyberKnife stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) have not been adequately addressed. The purpose of this study was to investigate pattern of recurrence according to irradiation field after CyberKnife SBRT for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Method(s): This retrospective study included patients with peripheral cT1/2N0M0 NSCLC that was treated with SBRT using a CyberKnife between May 2013 and March 2016 at single institute and followed up by more than two imaging examinations. Both operable and inoperable patients were included. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Cumulative incidence curves of recurrence were calculated and compared using the Gray's test. Result(s): Total 71 patients were included and analyzed in this study. The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 34 months (range, 7-64 months). The 2-year OS and PFS rate were 93% (95% CI: 83-97%) and 77% (95% CI: 65-86%), respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidence rate of infield recurrence and out-of-field recurrence were 6% (95% CI: 2-14%) and 17% (95% CI: 9-27%), respectively. Gross tumor volume (GTV) >=9 mL and diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) >=90 days were significantly associated with infield recurrence (P<0.001 and P=0.007), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation was significantly associated with out-of-field recurrence (P=0.014). Conclusion(s): Treatment efficacy after CyberKnife SBRT for peripheral early-stage NSCLC was identical to previous conventional linac-based SBRT reports. With short follow-up period, it was found that GTV and DTI were the significant predictive factor of infield recurrence, and EGFR mutation was the significant predictive factor of out-of-field recurrence.Copyright © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

N2  - Background: Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) provides complementary but qualitative insights to electrodiagnostic studies when assessing peripheral neuropathy. Recently, automatic segmentation of peripheral nerves from MRN has been explored for obtaining cross-sectional and volume biomarkers. However, even for modern convolu-tional neural networks (CNNs), peripheral nerve segmentation is difficult due to large volumes of interest, high class imbalances, and difficulties in learning shape representations. Aim(s): We aim to improve over traditional CNN-based segmentation by leveraging the sparsity and shape of peripheral nerves by using a point cloud representation. Method(s): We propose a three-step approach: First, an MRN image is processed by a CNN to obtain a probability map. Second, the probability map is transformed into a point cloud representation. Third, the point cloud is processed by a second CNN that classifies point-wise into peripheral nerve or background yielding a segmented peripheral nerve. For evaluation, we used 52 turbo spin-echo T2-weighted MRN images of the thigh of healthy volunteers (n=10) and patients diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy (n=42). Sequence parameters were TR of 4690ms, TE of 82ms, FOV of 384x330mm2, FA of 134degree, voxel size of 0.52x0.52x4.0mm3, and 60 axial-oriented slices with gap of 0.4mm. The sciatic nerve was manually segmented by three raters for inter-rater variability quantification and four-fold cross-validation was applied for evaluation. Result(s): The segmentation yields Dice coeffi-cients of 0.866+/-0.044, volumetric similarities of 0.946+/-0.041, and 95th percentile Hausdorff distances of 4.5+/-9.7mm, which is a statistically significant improvement over CNN-only segmentation of Bal-siger et al. with 0.746+/-0.130, 0.903+/-0.101, and 12.6+/-15.6mm. Inter-rater variabilities are 0.802+/-0.091, 0.905+/-0.082, and 9.2+/-17.6mm. Therefore, the approach achieved statistically significant better results for the Dice coefficient and the volumetric similarity and on-par results for the Haus-dorff distance compared to the inter-rater variability. Qualitatively, 3-D renderings show a high agreement between the automatic and manual segmentations. By synthetic experiments, we showed that the point cloud processing allows to explicitly learn a sciatic nerve-like shape. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that peripheral nerve segmentation from MRN is feasible and achieves human inter-rater performance. Such automatic segmentation might allow quantifying peripheral neuropathies for disease progression and outcome or serve as volume of interest for further quantitative MRN techniques.

N2  - Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used as a technique for the diagnostic work up and as a biomarker for disease progression or treatment effects in neuromuscular diseases. MRI of the brachial plexus is used to differentiate between treatable infl ammatory neuropathies and clinically relevant mimics as motor neuron disease, bus has limited sensitivity. Quantitative techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived parameters have been used on central nervous system studies, but occasionally in the peripheral nervous system, including the brachial plexus. Aim(s): The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of DTI of the brachial plexus and to assess whether it can differentiate between patients with chronic infl ammatory polyneuropathies and disease controls. Method(s): We performed a cross-sectional cohort study in patients with chronic infl ammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA). We performed DTI and fat-suppressed T2-weighted scans of the brachial plexus on a 3.0 T MRI scanner. DTI data was automatically processed using a custom-build pipeline. Processing comprised data denoising, affine registration to correct for subject motion and eddy currents, bspline registration to correct for EPI distortions, tensor estimation using an iWLLS algorithm, whole volume fiber tractogra-phy and nerve root segmentation. Fibre tractography was used to visualize the brachial plexus and for tract based analysis of the diffusion parameters. Independent samples T-test and one-way ANOVA test were used to compare quantitative DTI parameters between groups. Result(s): Interim analysis of 62 patients (CIDP=18, MMN=23, disease controls=21) shows significantly lower mean FA in CIDP patients (FA=0.25, SD=0.03, p=0.004), especially in treatment naive patients (FA=0.24, SD=0.02, p=0.001), and a trend towards higher FA in treatment naive MMN patients (FA=0.31, SD=0.04, p=0.106) compared to disease controls (FA=0.29, SD=0.03). Mean FA in MMN compared to CIDP patients differed significantly (p=0.001). MD, RD and AD did not show any differences between groups. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that DTI parameters of the brachial plexus differ between patients with MMN, CIDP and disease controls. However, our results still need to be confirmed after completion of the inclusions.

N2  - Background: Clinical examination and electro-physiology are currently standard for diagnostics and monitoring in chronic infl ammatory demyelinat-ing polyneuropathy (CIDP), non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, these measures are restricted to accessible nerves or insensitive to detect subtle changes regarding axonal injury and regeneration. Aim(s): To investigate the utility of a multimodal MRI protocol to detect and differentiate subtle peripheral nerve lesions and neurogenic muscle damage in patients with different neuropathic conditions. Method(s): 10 NSVN patients and 10 age-matched controls, 11 CIDP patients and 11 age-matched controls as well as 14 ALS patients and 13 age-matched controls underwent MRI, electrophysiological and clinical assessments. Patients and controls were assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of sciatic or tibial nerve and multiecho Dixon MRI of quadriceps and biceps femoris muscle (CIDP, ALS) or so-leus and gastrocnemius muscles (NSVN). MRI parameters were correlated with clinical and electro-physiological data. Result(s): DTI scans of sciatic and tibial nerve showed significant lower mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values compared to healthy controls. Intramuscular fat fractions in the measured muscles were sig-nificantly higher in patients compared to healthy controls. In NSVN patients FA values correlated negatively with clinical measure of pain. Conclusion(s): Our data provide proof-of-concept that DTI and multiecho Dixon are useful to assess axonal integrity and neurogenic muscle changes in different neuropathic conditions. Further studies are needed to establisch DTI and multiecho Dixon as diagnostic and surrogate marker in neuromuscular diseases.

N2  - Background: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is a increasingly prevalent severe complication in patients with type 2 diabetes. While lowering serum cholesterol levels is considered a common treatment to control cholesterol metabolism in type 2 diabetes, recent studies found that a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was associated with an increase in severity of clinical symptoms, and also with an increase in a specific lesion form in magnetic resonance neurography imaging of the sciatic nerve in patients with distal symmetric polyneuropa-thy. Aim(s): Our objective was to investigate the association between peripheral nerve lesions in patients with diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathy and serum cholesterol levels. Method(s): In this cross-sectional, prospective cohort study, we obtained clinical, serologic, and elec-trophysiologic data of 100 patients (distal symmetric polyneuropathy: 64, no polyneuropathy: 36) with type 2 diabetes, and performed magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg at a Siemens Trio 3T scanner. We applied an axial turbo spin-echo T2-weighted sequence with relaxation time: 5.97 seconds, echo time: 55 milliseconds, field of view: 160 x 160 square millimeter, matrix size: 512 x 512, slice thickness: 0.05 mm, intersection gap: 0.35 mm, in-plane-resolution: 0.5 x 0.3 mm, number of slices: 24. Lipid-equivalent nerve lesions were segmented and quantified with a semi-automatic approach. Result(s): We found that the tibial nerve conduction velocity was positively correlated with total serum cholesterol (p=0.02) and with serum low-density li-poprotein levels (p=0.04), while no such correlation was found for either serum high-density lipoprotein levels. Lipid-equivalent nerve lesions were positively correlated with the nerve's mean cross-sectional area (p<0.001), and negatively with total serum cholesterol levels (p<0.001) and low-density lipoprotein levels (p=0.003), as well as nerve conduction velocities of tibial and peroneal nerves (p=0.01, p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion(s): The findings indicate that low serum cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and distal symmetric polyneuropathy are associated with the amount of lipid-equivalent nerve lesions in magnetic resonance neurography. This agrees with recent studies that found low serum cholesterol levels to be associated with impaired nerve regeneration after axonal damage, presumably due to an insufficient supply of cholesterol to Schwann cells and neurite tips of the regenerating axon. With emerging therapies in type 2 diabetes such as PCSK9 inhibitors, that promote an aggressive lowering of cholesterol levels, our findings suggest that close attention should be paid to clinical signs of polyneuropathy.

N2  - Background and aims: The genetic component of multiple sclerosis (MS) is now set to 201 common variants and 32 signals from HLA. It is unclear how genetic knowledge can be used in clinical practice, for example in differential diagnosis between MS and other inflammatory conditions with different prognosis like adult-onset post-infectious inflammatory syndromes (APIS) Methods: 96 incident APIS have been consecutively recruited (1996-2016) at Mondino Institute, diagnosed according to clinical, MRI and CSF findings and followedup for >18 months. Patients have been typed using Illumina array, and genotypes imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. A weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) has been calculated based on known MS loci Results: Diagnosis includes encephalomyelitis (44%), myelitis (44%) and encephalitis (12%), and in 32% peripheral nervous system (PNS) was involved. Mean age of onset was 50 years, and female:male ratio 1.38. Patients were followed-up for 7 years and, at last follow-up, disease was monophasic in 67% and 54% had a low disability grade. The wGRS score of APIS cases was comparable to 370 healthy controls (wGRS=20.9 vs 20.7), while significantly lower compared to 907 RRMS cases (wGRS=21.2; p<0.0001). The separation was even stronger for APIS with PNS involvement vs RRMS (wGRS=20.6; p<0.0001) Conclusion(s): The distinction between MS and APIS, including ADEM, myelitis and encephalitis, is still hard to make. Our study shows that the new set of MS risk alleles does not confer increased susceptibility to APIS, and it supports the importance to discriminate these cases from MS.

N2  - Learning Objective #1: Diagnose the cobalt toxidrome. Learning Objective #2: Recognize risk factors for cobalt toxicity. CASE: A 59-year-old woman with new-onset ankle edema and fatigue presented for pre-operative evaluation prior to revision left hip arthroplasty. A cobalt prosthesis was placed 18 months ago after catastrophic failure of a ceramic-on-ceramic left hip arthroplasty, but subsequently developed "runaway wear". She denied other cardiovascular symptoms, but did note severe progressive hearing loss over the last eight months. A month later, she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was started on replacement. Her vision also markedly worsened despite normal ophthalmologic evaluations. She described minimal alcohol use and had no significant cardiovascular or neurologic family history. Physical examination was significant for regular tachycardia of 110 bpm, normal S1 and S2 without murmur, bilateral ankle edema, severe hearing and vision loss, no thyromegaly or nodules, and an otherwise normal exam. Basic laboratory evaluations, including CBC, creat-inine, and thyroid function studies, were normal. An ECG showed only sinus tachycardia. Review of recent brain MRI revealed no significant findings. Due to her signs of new-onset heart failure, an echocardiogram was performed, showing mild concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, LV enlargement, ejection fraction of 45%, and resting regional wall abnormalities. A follow up stress myocardial perfusion imaging study was performed, which revealed no significant perfusion defects, together suggesting a new underlying cardio-myopathy. Due to her known "runaway wear" of the joint prothesis and her new constellation of heart failure, hearing loss, vision loss, and hypothyroid-ism, serum heavy metal levels were obtained with normal titanium, chromium, and markedly elevated cobalt at 953 (normal 0.0-0.9) ng/ml. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Our case describes joint prosthesis-related systemic cobalt poisoning. The cobalt toxidrome classically involves cardio-myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, hearing and vision loss, and hypothyroid-ism. Cobalt toxicity was first described in the 1965 in nutritionally deficient alcoholics after breweries began using it as an additive agent. A rare, but emerging, modern cause of toxicity is cobalt joint prothesis wear in the setting of retained ceramic particles from previous joint failure. Treatment includes joint replacement and occasionally chelation therapy. Conclusion(s): Cobalt toxidrome includes cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, hearing and vision loss, and hypothyroidism Prosthetic joint failure is a new, emerging cause of cobalt toxicity.

N2  - Introduction: DADA2 is an autoinflammatory disease with autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by a heterogeneous clinical phenotype ranging from multisystemic inflammation (fever, polyarteritis nodosa, cerebral stroke, livedo reticularis, gastro-intestinal involvement, peripheral neuropathy etc.) to immune-dysregulation and immunodeficiency (lymphoproliferation, recurrent infections, cytopenia etc.). Objective(s): To extend the clinical spectrum of DADA2 reporting a case of isolated nonspecific systemic inflammatory syndrome associated with slight signs of immune-dysregulation in a patient with a novel ADA2 mutation. Method(s): In a patient with nonspecific inflammatory phenotype associated to susceptibility to viral infections, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel was performed; mutations detected were confirmed by direct sequencing (Sanger analysis). ADA2 enzymatic activity was analyzed in monocyte isolated from the patient and incubated with adenosine and an ADA1 inhibitor. Result(s): The girl, adopted and of Asian origin, began to suffer from nonspecific systemic inflammatory symptoms (high persistent fever and arthralgias) at the age of 6 years. In past history recurrent respiratory infections and impaired immunological response to viruses (CMV related hepatitis, measles after vaccination) were reported. After few months the patient developed clinical and laboratory findings of HLH (Hemophagocytic Lympho-Histocytosis), confirmed on bone marrow samples; treatment with intravenous (IV) high dose (HD) steroids was started, with prompt response. During steroids tapering fever and systemic inflammation reappeared; anti-IL1 treatment (anakinra) was not effective. Immunologic assessment demonstrated mild hypogammaglobulinemia and moderate NK deficiency on lymphocyte subsets. HD IV Immunoglobulins (IG) (2 g/kg every month) allowed to achieve a complete control of the clinical picture; the frequency of administration was progressively reduced to every 4 months due to persistent wellbeing. At the age of 9, after switching IG to the substitutive dosage, the patient experienced an Herpes Zoster virus reactivation (requiring prolonged antiviral treatment), followed by the reappearance of the inflammatory phenotype complicated by HLH with neurological involvement (irritability and lethargy), responsive to HD steroids and IG. A later cerebral MRI evidenced a small gliotic area in left Centrum Ovale. After steroids suspension, monthly HD IV IG administrations maintained clinical remission. Further immunological studies confirmed a reduction of NK cells with normal function. Hereditary HLH, Autoimmune Lympho-Proliferative Syndrome (ALPS) and main primary immunodeficiencies were ruled out. Given the clinical picture, a large NGS diagnostic panel (courtesy by K. Botzug, Vienna) for autoinflammatory diseases and immunodeficiencies was performed revealing the homozygous LEU141PRO ADA2 mutation, confirmed by Sanger analysis. Being this mutation novel, an ADA2 enzymatic activity test was performed revealing a complete loss of ADA2 activity. The parents refused anti-TNF treatment and the patient is still on monthly HD IG with a complete wellbeing after 3 years of follow-up. Conclusion(s): The current report enlarges the clinical spectrum associated with DADA2 to a persistent unspecific inflammatory syndrome, complicated by HLH. This case further emphasizes the possibility that NGS could unravel unusual phenotypes of already known inflammatory syndromes. Even if further reports are required, the response to high doses IG observed in the present case it is of interest. Even if anti-TNF is the treatment of choice HD IV IG could be a possible treatment in DADA2, especially during the acute phase.

N2  - Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) with anti-neurofascin-155 antibodies is a subgroup of CIDP with tremor and poor response to intravenous immunoglobulins. We report on a patient affected with NF-155 IgG4 seropositive CIDP who, along with the typical symptoms of the disease, presented with therapy unresponsive tongue tremor. A previously healthy 23-year-old man came to our attention for a 6 months history of gait difficulties secondary to sensory-motor deficit at lower limbs, and upper limbs tremor severely limiting fine motor tasks. He had ataxic-stepping gait, bilateral distal weakness, tactile hypoesthesia and loss of vibration sense up to the knees, areflexia. High amplitude and low frequency tremor was present at arms and tongue. Besides the tremor, no cerebellar signs were present. Neurophysiology showed signs of diffuse demyelinating neuropathy consistent with CIDP, according to European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) criteria. Tongue EMG was negative. Nerve ultrasound showed increased cross-sectional area (CSA) of the brachial plexus (156 mm2 on the right side, 129 mm2 on the left side, normal values <= 80 mm2) and nerves trunks. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed increased total protein level (175 mg/dl) with normal leukocyte count. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, except for serum positivity at high titer (OD 2.9, cutoff 0.2-0.3) for IgG4 antibody to neurofascin-155. Brain and spine MRI with Gadolinium were negative. 3D-MR Neurography revealed bilateral hypertrophy of brachial and lumbosacral plexi. The patient was diagnosed with neurofascin-155 IgG4 seropositive CIDP and treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 5 days, followed by 1 g/ day for 2 days in the next 2 months) with improvement of motor and sensory deficit, but tremor persisted. Subsequently he underwent intravenous immunoglobulins without improvement of the tremor. Among CIDP, the recently described patients with IgG4 anti-NF-155 antibodies represent a peculiar and distinct subgroup. Latest reports, as the present, are still enriching the definition of this CIDP subgroup with younger age, severe weakness, predominantly distal sensory disturbances, cranial nerve hypertrophy, intention tremor, sensory ataxia and poor response to intravenous immunoglobulins. NF-155 antibodies have been shown also to stain rat cerebellum suggesting a possible central origin of the therapy unresponsive tremor, and in some patients central nervous system demyelinating alterations have also been detected at the brain MRI. Besides one patient with immunotherapy-responsive head and voice tremor, this is to our knowledge the first NF-155 antibody seropositive patient with arms and tongue tremor, who is now candidate to rituximab treatment.

N2  - Purpose: To perform in vivo isotropic-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of lumbosacral and sciatic nerves with a phase-navigated diffusion-prepared (DP) 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) acquisition and modified reconstruction incorporating intershot phase-error correction and to investigate the improvement on image quality and diffusion quantification with the proposed phase correction. Method(s): Phase-navigated DP 3D TSE included magnitude stabilizers to minimize motion and eddy-current effects on the signal magnitude. Phase navigation of motion-induced phase errors was introduced before readout in 3D TSE. DTI of lower back nerves was performed in vivo using 3D TSE and single-shot echo planar imaging (ss-EPI) in 13 subjects. Diffusion data were phase-corrected per kz plane with respect to T2-weighted data. The effects of motion-induced phase errors on DTI quantification was assessed for 3D TSE and compared with ss-EPI. Result(s): Non-phase-corrected 3D TSE resulted in artifacts in diffusion-weighted images and overestimated DTI parameters in the sciatic nerve (mean diffusivity [MD] = 2.06 +/- 0.45). Phase correction of 3D TSE DTI data resulted in reductions in all DTI parameters (MD = 1.73 +/- 0.26) of statistical significance (P <= 0.001) and in closer agreement with ss-EPI DTI parameters (MD = 1.62 +/- 0.21). Conclusion(s): DP 3D TSE with phase correction allows distortion-free isotropic diffusion imaging of lower back nerves with robustness to motion-induced artifacts and DTI quantification errors.

N2  - Peripheral nerve injuries result in severe loss of sensory and motor functions in the afflicted limb. There is a lack of standardised models to non-invasively study degeneration, regeneration, and normalisation of neuronal microstructure in peripheral nerves. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive evaluation of peripheral nerve injuries, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and tractography on a rat model of sciatic nerve injury. 10 female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to sciatic nerve neurotmesis and studied using a 9.4T magnet, by performing DTI and DKI of the sciatic nerve before and 4 weeks after injury. The distal nerve stump showed a decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis (MK), axonal water fraction (AWF), and radial and axonal kurtosis (RK, AK) after injury. The proximal stump showed a significant decrease in axial diffusivity (AD) and increase of MK and AK as compared with the uninjured nerve. Both mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) increased in the distal stump after injury. Tractography visualised the sciatic nerve and the site of injury, as well as local variations of the diffusion parameters following injury. In summary, the described method detects changes both proximal and distal to the nerve injury.

T1  - Diffusion MRI in acute nervous system injury
A1  - Budde, Matthew D.
A1  - Skinner, Nathan P. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and related techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are uniquely sensitive to the microstructure of the brain and spinal cord. In the acute aftermath of nervous system injury, for example, DWI reveals changes caused by injury that remains invisible on other MRI contrasts such as T2-weighted imaging. This ability has led to a demonstrated clinical utility in cerebral ischemia. However, despite strong promise in preclinical models and research settings, DWI has not been as readily adopted for other acute injuries such as traumatic spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the precise biophysical mechanisms that underlie DWI and DTI changes are not fully understood. In this report, we review the DWI and DTI changes that occur in acute neurological injury of cerebral ischemia, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and peripheral nerve injury. Their associations with the underlying biology are examined with an emphasis on the role of acute axon and dendrite beading. Lastly, emerging DWI techniques to overcome the limitations of DTI are discussed as these may offer the needed improvements to translate to clinical settings.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Despite the importance of pelvic floor muscles, significant controversy still exists about the true structural details of these muscles. We provide an objective analysis of the architecture and orientation of the superficial muscles of the perineum using a novel approach. Magnetic Resonance Diffusion Tensor Images (MR-DTI) were acquired in 10 healthy asymptomatic nulliparous women, and 4 healthy males. Global tractography was then used to generate the architecture of the muscles. Micro-CT imaging of a male cadaver was performed for validation of the fiber tracking results. Results show that muscles fibers of the external anal sphincter, from the right and left side, cross midline in the region of the perineal body to continue as transverse perinea and bulbospongiosus muscles of the opposite side. The morphology of the external anal sphincter resembles that of the number '8' or a "purse string". The crossing of muscle fascicles in the perineal body was supported by micro-CT imaging in the male subject. The superficial muscles of the perineum, and external anal sphincter are frequently damaged during child birth related injuries to the pelvic floor; we propose the use of MR-DTI based global tractography as a non-invasive imaging technique to assess damage to these muscles.

N2  - PURPOSE: Given no definite consensus on the accepted autograft orientation during peripheral nerve injury repair, we compare outcomes between reverse and normally oriented autografts using an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique, diffusion tensor imaging. METHOD(S): Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: sham-left sciatic nerve isolation without injury, reverse autograft-10-mm cut left sciatic nerve segment reoriented 180degree and used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps, or normally oriented autograft-10-mm cut nerve segment kept in its normal orientation for coaptation. Animals underwent sciatic functional index and foot fault behavior studies at 72 hours, and then weekly. At 6 weeks, axons proximal, within, and distal to the autograft were evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging and choline acetyltransferase motor staining for immunohistochemistry. Toluidine blue staining of 1-mum sections was used to assess axon count, density, and diameter. Bilateral gastrocnemius/soleus muscle weights were compared to obtain a net wet weight. Comparison of the groups was performed using Mann-Whiney U or Kruskal-Wallis H tests to determine significance. RESULT(S): Diffusion tensor imaging findings including fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity were similar between reverse and normally oriented autografts. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography demonstrated proximodistal nerve regeneration in both autograft groups. Motor axon counts proximal, within, and distal to the autografts were similar. Likewise, axon count, density, and diameter were similar between the autograft groups. Muscle net weight at 6 weeks and behavioral outcomes (sciatic functional index and foot fault) at any tested time point were also similar between reverse and normally oriented autografts. CONCLUSION(S): Diffusion tensor imaging may be a useful assessment tool for peripheral nerve regeneration. Reversing nerve autograft polarity did not demonstrate to have an influence on functional or regenerative outcomes.

N2  - Objective: Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is the most frequent spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide and characterized by brainstem, basal ganglia, and cerebellar damage. However, little is known about the natural history of the disease. This motivated us to determine the extension and progression of central nervous system involvement in SCA3/MJD using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based analyses in a large cohort of patients (n = 79) and presymptomatic subjects (n = 12). Method(s): All subjects underwent MRI in a 3T device to assess gray and white matter. To evaluate the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, we used measures from FreeSurfer and SUIT. T1-multiatlas assessed deep gray matter. Diffusion tensor imaging multiatlas was used to investigate cerebral white matter (WM) and SpineSeg to assess the cervical spinal cord. Result(s): There was widespread WM and cerebellar damage, in contrast to the restricted motor cortex involvement when all patients are compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Presymtomatic patients showed WM microstructural abnormalities mainly in the cerebellar and cerebral peduncles and volumetric reduction of midbrain, spinal cord, and substantia nigra. To assess the disease progression, we divided patients into four subgroups defined by time from ataxia onset. There was a clear pattern of evolving structural compromise, starting in infratentorial structures and progressing up to the cerebral cortex. Conclusion(s): Structural damage in SCA3/MJD begins in the spinal cord, cerebellar peduncles, as well as substantia nigra and progresses to cerebral areas in the long term. These structural differences reveal some insights into the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD and suggest a staging scheme to map the progression of the disease.

N2  - To detect, localize, and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in correlation with clinical and electrophysiologic findings. Methods We prospectively examined 20 patients with AL-polyneuropathy (PNP) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. After detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic testing, the patient group was subdivided into mild and moderate PNP. MRN in a 3.0 tesla scanner with anatomical coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to the tibiotalar joint was performed by using T2-weighted and dual-echo 2-dimensional sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3-dimensional, T2-weighted inversion recovery sequence. Besides evaluation of nerve T2-weighted signal, detailed quantification of nerve injury by morphometric (nerve caliber) and microstructural MRN markers (proton spin density, T2 relaxation time) was conducted. Results Nerve T2-weighted signal increase correlated with disease severity: moderate (420.2 +/- 60.1) vs mild AL-PNP (307.2 +/- 17.9; p = 0.0003) vs controls (207.0 +/- 6.4; p < 0.0001). Proton spin density was also higher in moderate (tibial: 525.5 +/- 53.0; peroneal: 553.6 +/- 64.5; sural: 492.0 +/- 56.6) and mild AL-PNP (tibial: 431.6 +/- 22.0; peroneal: 457.6 +/- 21.7; sural: 404.8 +/- 25.2) vs controls (tibial: 310.5 +/- 14.1; peroneal: 313.6 +/- 11.6; sural: 261.7 +/- 11.0; p < 0.0001 for all nerves). T2 relaxation time was elevated in moderate AL-PNP only (tibial: p = 0.0106; peroneal: p = 0.0070; sural: p = 0.0190). Tibial nerve caliber was higher in moderate (58.0 +/- 8.8 mm 3) vs mild AL-PNP (46.5 +/- 2.5 mm 3; p = 0.008) vs controls (39.1 +/- 1.2 mm 3; p < 0.0001). Conclusions MRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve injury in AL-PNP in vivo with high sensitivity and in close correlation with the clinical stage. Quantitative parameters are feasible new imaging biomarkers for the detection of early AL-PNP and might help to monitor microstructural nerve tissue changes under treatment.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that measures the extent of restricted water diffusion and anisotropy in biological tissue. Although DTI has been widely applied in the brain, more recently researchers have used it to characterize nerve pathology in the setting of entrapment neuropathy, traumatic injury, and tumor. DTI artifacts are exacerbated when imaging off isocenter in the body. Anecdotally, the most significant artifacts in peripheral nerve DTI include magnetic field inhomogeneity, motion, incomplete fat suppression, aliasing, and distortion. High spatial resolution is also required to reliably evaluate smaller peripheral nerves. This article provides an overview of such technical issues, particularly when trying to apply DTI in the clinical setting, and offers potential solutions. Level of Evidence: 5.

N2  - Purpose: To examine dorsal root ganglia and the proximal nerve segments in female patients with Fabry disease by functional and morphometric magnetic resonance neurography. Method(s): In this prospective multicenter study the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and proximal sciatic nerve were examined in ten female patients with Fabry disease by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3 T. Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3-S2, permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1 and the spinal nerve L5 as well as the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic nerve were compared to 16 gender-matched healthy controls. Result(s): Dorsal root ganglia were symmetrically enlarged by 54% (L3), 79% (L4), 60% (L5), 94% (S1), and 106% (S2) (p < 0.001). Additionally, permeability of the blood-tissue interface was decreased by 47% (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the peripheral zone of the dorsal root ganglia, where the cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons are located (p < 0.001). While spinal nerve permeability showed no differences compared to healthy controls, proximal sciatic nerve cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6% (p < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Although heterozygous, Fabry females show severe enlarged dorsal root ganglia with a concomitant dysfunctional perfusion, even in patients with minor disease progression and in patients who are not considered for enzyme replacement therapy yet. Alterations in dorsal root ganglia volume and perfusion might serve as a very early in vivo marker for involvement of the peripheral nervous system in Fabry disease, even in patients with residual enzyme activity.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Peripheral nerves are a composite tissue consisting of neurovascular elements packaged within a well-organized extracellular matrix. Their composition, size, and anatomy render nerves a challenging medical imaging target. In contrast to morphological MRI, which represents the predominant approach to nerve imaging, quantitative MRI sequences can provide information regarding tissue composition. Here, we applied standard clinical Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) and experimental three-dimensional (3D) ultrashort echo time (UTE) Cones sequences for quantitative nerve imaging including T2 measurement with single-component analysis, T2* measurement with single-component and bi-component analyses, and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) analysis. We demonstrated the feasibility and the high quality of single-component T2*, bi-component T2*, and MTR approaches to analyze nerves imaged with clinically deployed 3D UTE Cones pulse sequences. For 24 single fascicles from eight nerves, we measured a mean single-component T2* of 22.6 +/-8.9 ms, and a short T2* component (STC) with a mean T2* of 1.7 +/-1.0 ms and a mean fraction of (6.74 +/-4.31)% in bi-component analysis. For eight whole nerves, we measured a mean single-component T2* of 16.7 +/-2.2 ms, and an STC with a mean T2* of 3.0 +/-1.0 ms and a mean fraction of (15.56 +/-7.07)% in bi-component analysis. For nine fascicles from three healthy nerves, we measured a mean MTR of (25.2 +/-1.9)% for single fascicles and a mean MTR of (23.6 +/-0.9)% for whole nerves. No statistically significant correlation was observed between any MRI parameter and routine histological outcomes, perhaps due to the small sample size and lack of apparent sample pathology. Overall, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of measuring quantitative MR outcomes ex vivo, which might reflect features of nerve structure and macromolecular content. These methods should be validated comprehensively on a larger and more diverse set of nerve samples, towards the interpretation of in vivo outcomes. These approaches have new and broad implications for the management of nerve disease, injury, and repair.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Background and Purpose Magnetization transfer contrast imaging provides indirect information on the concentration of "bound" water protons and their interactions with "free" water molecules. The purpose of this study is to analyze location- and age-dependent changes in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of lower extremity nerves. Materials and Methods Ten younger (20-32 years) and 5 older (50-63 years) healthy volunteers underwent magnetization transfer contrast imaging at 3 Tesla Two 3-dimensional gradient echo sequences with and without an off-resonance saturation pulse (repetition time: 58 milliseconds; echo time: 2.46 milliseconds; band width: 530 Hz/Px; flip angle: alpha = 7degree) were acquired at 3 different locations covering the proximal thigh to the distal lower leg in the group of younger volunteers and at 2 different locations covering the proximal to distal thigh in the group of older volunteers. Sciatic and tibial nerve regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn and additional ROIs were placed in predetermined muscles. Magnetization transfer ratios were extracted from respective ROIs and calculated for each individual and location. Results In young volunteers, mean values of nerve and muscle MTR were not different between the proximal thigh (nerve: 20.34 +/- 0.91; muscle: 31.71 +/- 0.29), distal thigh (nerve: 19.90 +/- 0.98; P = 0.76; muscle: 31.53 +/- 0.69; P = 0.87), and lower leg (nerve: 20.82 +/- 1.07; P = 0.73; muscle: 32.44 +/- 1.11; P = 0.51). An age-dependent decrease of sciatic nerve MTR was observed in the group of older volunteers (16.95 +/- 1.2) compared with the group of younger volunteers (20.12 +/- 0.65; P = 0.019). Differences in muscle MTR were not significant between older (31.01 +/- 0.49) and younger (31.62 +/- 0.37; P = 0.20) volunteers. Conclusion The MTR of lower extremity nerves shows no proximal-to-distal gradient in young healthy volunteers but decreases with age. For future studies using MTR in peripheral nerve disorders, these findings suggest that referencing magnetization transfer contrast values in terms of age, but not anatomical nerve location is required.Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

T1  - 3D MRI in Musculoskeletal Imaging: Current and Future Applications
A1  - Altahawi, Faysal

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Purpose of Review: This article addresses current clinical applications, recent literature, and potential future applications of 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI) for musculoskeletal (MSK) applications. Recent Findings: The main advantage of 3D MRI over standard 2-dimensional MRI is its ability to reduce partial volume averaging artifacts and create multiplanar reconstruction (MPRs) in any plane with any slice thickness from a single high-resolution isotropic acquisition. 3D MRI acquisitions are particularly useful for the evaluation of articular cartilage, which is prone to volume averaging artifacts, and for the assessment of longitudinally coursing structures such as peripheral nerves and tendons, which are better visualized with non-orthogonal MPRs. 3D MRI is also useful for surface and volumetric analysis of bone and cartilage for preoperative and longitudinal assessments. Current research is focused on decreasing acquisition times and automating segmentation through machine learning, thus overcoming some of the current limitations of 3D MRI and providing new applications for this technique. Summary: 3D MRI is widely used in MSK imaging today, and its use is likely to continue to increase in the future, with recent advancements focused on accelerated acquisition techniques and quantitative imaging.Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - We generated a knockout mouse for the neuronal-specific beta-tubulin isoform Tubb3 to investigate its role in nervous system formation and maintenance. Tubb3-/- mice have no detectable neurobehavioral or neuropathological deficits, and upregulation of mRNA and protein of the remaining beta-tubulin isotypes results in equivalent total beta-tubulin levels in Tubb3-/- and wild-type mice. Despite similar levels of total beta-tubulin, adult dorsal root ganglia lacking TUBB3 have decreased growth cone microtubule dynamics and a decreased neurite outgrowth rate of 22% in vitro and in vivo. The effect of the 22% slower growth rate is exacerbated for sensory recovery, where fibers must reinnervate the full volume of the skin to recover touch function. Overall, these data reveal that, while TUBB3 is not required for formation of the nervous system, it has a specific role in the rate of peripheral axon regeneration that cannot be replaced by other beta-tubulins. Latremoliere et al. show that the neuronal-specific tubulin isoform TUBB3 is not required for normal development and function of the nervous system. Lack of TUBB3 decreases the dynamics of microtubules in growth cones, and this reduces axonal growth after peripheral nerve injury and strongly delays functional recovery.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s)

N2  - Objectives: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are complex, histologically benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that are challenging to measure by simple line measurements. Computer-aided volumetric segmentation of PN has become the recommended method to assess response in clinical trials directed at PN. Different methods for volumetric analysis of PN have been developed. The goal of this study is to test the level of agreement in volume measurements and in interval changes using two separate methods of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Method(s): Three independent volume measurements were performed on 15 PN imaged at three time-points using 3DQI software at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) and MEDx software at NCI. Result(s): Median volume differences at each time-point comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were -0.5, -4.2, and -19.9 mL; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were -21.0, -47.0, and -21.0 mL; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were -10.0, -70.3, and -29.9 mL. Median differences in percentage change over time comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were -1.7, 1.1, and -1.0%; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were -2.3, 3.3, and -1.1%; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were -0.4, 2.0, and -1.5%. Volume differences were <20% of the mean of the two measurements in 117 of 135 comparisons (86.7%). Difference in interval change was <20% in 120 of the 135 comparisons (88.9%), while disease status classification was concordant in 115 of 135 comparisons (85.2%). Conclusion(s): The volumes, interval changes, and progression status classifications were in good agreement. The comparison of two volumetric analysis methods suggests no systematic differences in tumor assessment. A prospective comparison of the two methods is planned.Copyright © 2018

N2  - Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been applied in the lumbar and sacral nerves in vivo, but information about the reproducibility of this method is needed before DTI can be used reliably in clinical practice across centers. Purpose(s): In this multicenter study the reproducibility of DTI of the lumbosacral nerves in healthy volunteers was investigated. Study Type: Prospective control series. Subjects: Twenty healthy subjects. Field Strength/Sequence: 3T MRI. 3D turbo spin echo, and 3.0 mm isotropic DTI scan. Assessment: The DTI scan was performed three times (twice in the same session, intrascan reproducibility, and once after an hour, interscan reproducibility). At site 2, 1 week later, the protocol was repeated (interweek reproducibility). Fiber tractography (FT) of the lumbar and sacral nerves (L3-S2) was performed to obtain values for fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity. Statistical Tests: Reproducibility was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and power calculations were performed. Result(s): FT was successful and reproducible in all datasets. ICCs for all diffusion parameters were high for intrascan (ranging from 0.70-0.85), intermediate for interscan (ranging from 0.61-0.73), and interweek reliability (ranging from 0.58-0.62). There were small but significant differences between the interweek diffusivity values (P < 0.0005). Depending on the effect size, nerve location, and parameter of interest, power calculations showed that sample sizes between 10 and 232 subjects are needed for cross-sectional studies. Data Conclusion(s): We found that DTI and FT of the lumbosacral nerves have intermediate to high reproducibility within and between scans. Based on these results, 10-58 subjects are needed to find a 10% change in parameters in cross-sectional studies of the lumbar and sacral nerves. The small significant differences of the interweek comparison suggest that results from longitudinal studies need to be interpreted carefully, since small differences may also be caused by factors other than disease progression or therapeutic effects.

N2  - Objectives The aim of this study was to describe the development of morphologic and diffusion tensor imaging sequences of peripheral nerves at 7 T, using carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as a model system of focal nerve injury. Materials and Methods Morphologic images were acquired at 7 T using a balanced steady-state free precession sequence. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed using single-shot echo-planar imaging and readout-segmented echo-planar imaging sequences. Different acquisition and postprocessing methods were compared to describe the optimal analysis pipeline. Magnetic resonance imaging parameters including cross-sectional areas, signal intensity, fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as mean, axial, and radial diffusivity were compared between patients with CTS (n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 6) using analyses of covariance corrected for age (significance set at P < 0.05). Pearson correlations with Bonferroni correction were used to determine association of magnetic resonance imaging parameters with clinical measures (significance set at P < 0.01). Results The 7 T acquisitions with high in-plane resolution (0.2 x 0.2mm) afforded detailed morphologic resolution of peripheral nerve fascicles. For diffusion tensor imaging, single-shot echo-planar imaging was more efficient than readout-segmented echo-planar imaging in terms of signal-to-noise ratio per unit scan time. Distortion artifacts were pronounced, but could be corrected during postprocessing. Registration of FA maps to the morphologic images was successful. The developed imaging and analysis pipeline identified lower median nerve FA (pisiform bone, 0.37 [SD 0.10]) and higher radial diffusivity (1.08 [0.20]) in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (0.53 [0.06] and 0.78 [0.11], respectively, P < 0.047). Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity strongly correlated with patients' symptoms (r = -0.866 and 0.866, respectively, P = 0.005). Conclusions Our data demonstrate the feasibility of morphologic and diffusion peripheral nerve imaging at 7 T. Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity were found to be correlates of symptom severity.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Botulinum neurotoxin A (BTX-A) intervention has long-term benefits for children with obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP). Although cortical plasticity has been widely studied, plasticity in white matter has not received as much attention. Here, six children with OBPP underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before and 6 months after BTX-A treatment. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded. The aim was to investigate changes in the corticospinal tract (CST) as an example longitudinal observation of white matter plasticity. Deterministic fiber tracking with a Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking algorithm was used to reconstruct the CST. Fiber tracts passing through a region of interest (ROI) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and a target ROI in the upper-limb representation of M1 (defined by task-related fMRI) were selected as the CST. Motor performances were improved while EMG showed no significant difference 6 months after the treatment. We observed a significant increase in mean fractional anisotropy and a significant decrease in fiber number after treatment. We analyzed the correlations between DTI metrics and clinical motor assessments. Although the correlation results were not statistically significant, they support the notion that BTX-A treatment causes white matter plasticity and has a positive long-term outcome. Peripheral deafferentation may lead to altered information flow, resulting in the positive adaptation of white matter. This study provides novel insight into cerebral plasticity following peripheral nerve regeneration and indicates that a combination of relatively non-invasive therapies can accelerate plasticity of sensorimotor circuits and promote functional recovery in OBPP.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - This study aims to find accurate angles and depths of lateral ventricle puncture using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reconstruction, as well as to provide an optimized and alternative puncturing strategy. A total of 90 computed tomography (CT) images and 30 CT images with DTI were analyzed. The measurements were performed on coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes. Some distances and angles were measured to determine the best angle and penetration depth during the puncture process. Important landmarks of the lateral ventricle were also measured, and a comparison of the differences between 2 hemispheres was also assessed. It showed that the vertical distance from the superior margin to inferior margin of the lateral ventricle was 22.2+/-0.5mm and the length was 124.1+/-2.1mm. In the frontal horn puncture approach, the penetration depth should be limited between 105.2 and 109.4 mm, the angle should be 71.6+/-2.7degree. During the occipital horn puncture approach, puncturing depth was from 90.7 to 111.4mm, and angle was 15.3+/-1.8degree. Through the parietal lobe puncture approach, which was firstly brought out in this study, the puncturing length should be 124.4 to 130.2mm and angle was 56.6+/-2.0degree. The traditional recommended protocol of lateral ventricle puncture is not accurate, the refined lateral ventricle puncture protocol established in this study will reduce injury and remain function. A DTI imaging examination combining with nerve fibers reconstruction were strongly recommended before lateral ventricle puncture, which will help neurosurgeons to determine the best puncturing angles and depth.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

N2  - Study Design. Prospective, cross-sectional observational study. Objective. We aimed to investigate the effects of chronic cervical radiculopathy (CR) on the cross-sectional area (CSA) values of the cervical nerve roots (CNRs), median, ulnar, and radial nerves with high-resolution ultrasonography. Summary of Background Data. Symptomatic nerve roots are wider than asymptomatic nerve roots due to the presence of edema. Peripheral nerves have also been shown to develop edema, fibrosis, and changes distal to the affected nerve as a result of mechanical compression. In addition according to "double-crush syndrome" hypothesis, the peripheral nerves are more sensitive to pressure, and a proximal nerve lesion makes the distal segment of the nerve more susceptible to anatomic deterioration by causing interruption in the axoplasmic conduction due to compression. Methods. Forty patients with chronic CR were included to the study. Both affected CNRs and the contralateral nerve roots (control group) were evaluated with high-resolution ultrasonography. Ulnar and median nerve CSA measurements were performed at four measurement points and radial nerve measurements at a single measurement point. Results. CSA measurements were statistically significantly higher at the CNR of the affected side compared to the unaffected side. There was no statistically significant difference when affected and unaffected sides were compared in terms of measurements performed from median, ulnar, and radial nerves at all measurement points. Conclusion. The results of the present study indicate that the changes in the CNR caused by CR do not have any effect on the peripheral nerves. We did not find any affection in peripheral nerve CSA that might have been suggestive of double-crush syndrome in CR. Level of Evidence: 2 .Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - MRI relaxometry is sensitive to a variety of tissue characteristics in a complex manner, which makes it both attractive and challenging for characterizing tissue. This article reviews the most common water proton relaxometry measures, T1, T2, and T2 *, and reports on their development and current potential to probe the composition and microstructure of brain tissue. The development of these relaxometry measures is challenged by the need for suitably accurate tissue models, as well as robust acquisition and analysis methodologies. MRI relaxometry has been established as a tool for characterizing neural tissue, particular with respect to myelination, and the potential for further development exists.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It explains step by step how to establish MRN at an institution: how to set up MRN protocols, how to train technicians, what a report needs to contain, and how relevant findings should be communicated to the referring physician. Advanced imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging are only briefly discussed at the end of the article because most of those techniques are difficult for beginners and are still not considered standard in the clinical routine.Copyright © 2018 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

N2  - Many studies have demonstrated that combining nerve conduits with neural stem cells or growth factors can repair peripheral nerve injury in rodents. However, nerve damage does occur with longer gaps in human than in rodents, thus findings from rodent studies are difficult to translate to clinical practice. Minipigs have a longer gap that is more closely applicable to the challenge of human nerve grafting in extensive traumatic nerve damage. In this study, human amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs) and polylactate nerve conduits were used to repair sciatic nerve injury in minipigs. The AFSCs exhibited the properties of mesenchymal stem cells with a propensity toward neural stem cells. Measurements of compound muscle action potential implied that administration of conduits with AFSCs was beneficial in function recovery in the minipig model compared with conduits alone. The results of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) based fiber tractography assay in the minipig model suggest that combining AFSCs with conduits could expedite the repair of sciatic nerve injury. Further, MR-based DTI provides an effective and non-invasive method to visualize the sciatic nerve and to monitor the regeneration progress of injured nerve in a longitudinal study.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Repetitive electrical activity produces microstructural alteration in myelinated axons, which may afford the opportunity to noninvasively monitor function of myelinated fibers in peripheral nervous system (PNS)/CNS pathways. Microstructural changes were assessed via two different magnetic-resonance-based approaches: diffusion fMRI and dynamic T2 spectroscopy in the ex vivo perfused bullfrog sciatic nerves. Using this robust, classical model as a platform for testing, we demonstrate that noninvasive diffusion fMRI, based on standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can clearly localize the sites of axonal conduction blockage as might be encountered in neurotrauma or other lesion types. It is also shown that the diffusion fMRI response is graded in proportion to the total number of electrical impulses carried through a given locus. Dynamic T2 spectroscopy of the perfused frog nerves point to an electrical-activity-induced redistribution of tissue water and myelin structural changes. Diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) reveals a reversible shift of tissue water into a restricted isotropic diffusion signal component. Submyelinic vacuoles are observed in electron-microscopy images of tissue fixed during electrical stimulation. A slowing of the compound action potential conduction velocity accompanies repetitive electrical activity. Correlations between electrophysiology and MRI parameters during and immediately after stimulation are presented. Potential mechanisms and interpretations of these results are discussed.Copyright © 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on 3D fat-suppressed techniques provide high accuracy for evaluation of brachial plexus and peripheral nerve lesions from a qualitative point of view. However, this qualitative evaluation often demonstrates overlapping features among different pathologies (Pullman et al., 2013). Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are functional MRI techniques that have been successfully applied in the imaging of central nervous system lesions, and now are being imported, with promising results for peripheral nerve and plexus evaluation. Several derived parameters from DWI and DTI studies such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or fractional anisotropy (FA), can be used as potential biomarkers of neural damage by providing information about axonal flow, fiber organization or myelin integrity (Andreou et al., 2015). In this study we assess the role of DW and DT based quantitative measures in characterization of traumatic and non traumatic lesions of brachial plexus and peripheral nerve and its influence on therapeutic management and outcome. Method(s): 34 patients with features of brachial plexopathy and peripheral neuropathy were included in the study. MR neurography examinations included conventional MR sequences and unidirectional DW-MRN with background suppression (DWIBS) and DTI. The images were independently reviewed by two radiologists and the findings were recorded at different levels of the brachial plexus: ganglia, roots, trunks, divisions and cords. Mean ADC and FA values were determined within each lesion and within contra lateral homologous unaffected segment of the plexus. The Mann-Whitney Test was used to calculate the differences in ADC&FA values between diseased and normal sides and the One way ANOVA test between diseased segments of different pathologies with p-values <0.05 being considered statistically significant. Result(s): patients were classified according to etiologic causes into four categories: traumatic, compressive degenerative disk, radiation induced plexitis and neoplastic nerve compression or invasion. T2 high signal intensity and swelling of the affected nerve, muscular denervation and complication such as pseudo meningeocele and neuroma were the major findings in qualitatitve sequences. A statistically significant difference in ADC and FA values were found between diseased and normal sides as well as across the traumatic and non traumatic groups and between benign compressive and malignant infiltrative etiologies. Conclusion(s): The resulted values of newly designed quantitative protocols give us functional and numerical marker by which the diagnosis and differentiation of different pathologies of peripheral nerves and brachial plexus will be more suitable.Copyright © 2018

N2  - Background: We present a clinical, electrophysiological, sonographical and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) study examining the complementary role of two neuroimaging methods of the peripheral nervous system for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Furthermore, we explore the significance of cross-sectional area (CSA) increase through correlations with MRN markers of nerve integrity. Method(s): A total of 108 nerve segments on the median, ulnar, radial, tibial and fibular nerve, as well as the lumbar and cervical plexus of 18 CIDP patients were examined with high-resonance nerve ultrasound (HRUS) and MRN additionally to the nerve conduction studies. Result(s): We observed a fair degree of correlation of the CSA values for all nerves/nerve segments between the two methods, with a low random error in Bland-Altman analysis (bias = HRUS-CSA - MRN-CSA, -0.61 to -3.26 mm). CSA in HRUS correlated with the nerve T2-weighted (nT2) signal increase as well as with diffusion tensor imaging parameters such as fractional anisotropy, a marker of microstructural integrity. HRUS-CSA of the interscalene brachial plexus correlated significantly with the MRN-CSA and nT2 signal of the L5 and S1 roots of the lumbar plexus. Conclusion(s): HRUS allows for reliable CSA imaging of all peripheral nerves and the cervical plexus, and CSA correlates with markers of nerve integrity. Imaging of proximal segments as well as the estimation of nerve integrity require MRN as a complementary method.Copyright © The Author(s), 2018.

N2  - Diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies relies on neurological examinations, electrodiagnostic studies, and since recently magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a fully-automatic segmentation method of peripheral nerves of the thigh. T2-weighted sequences without fat suppression acquired on a 3 T MR scanner were retrospectively analyzed in 10 healthy volunteers and 42 patients suffering from clinically and electrophysiologically diagnosed sciatic neuropathy. A fully-convolutional neural network was developed to segment the MRN images into peripheral nerve and background tissues. The performance of the method was compared to manual inter-rater segmentation variability. The proposed method yielded Dice coefficients of 0.859 +/- 0.061 and 0.719 +/- 0.128, Hausdorff distances of 13.9 +/- 26.6 and 12.4 +/- 12.1 mm, and volumetric similarities of 0.930 +/- 0.054 and 0.897 +/- 0.109, for the healthy volunteer and patient cohorts, respectively. The complete segmentation process requires less than one second, which is a significant decrease to manual segmentation with an average duration of 19 +/- 8 min. Considering cross-sectional area or signal intensity of the segmented nerves, focal and extended lesions might be detected. Such analyses could be used as biomarker for lesion burden, or serve as volume of interest for further quantitative MRN techniques. We demonstrated that fully-automatic segmentation of healthy and neuropathic sciatic nerves can be performed from standard MRN images with good accuracy and in a clinically feasible time.Copyright © 2007-2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

N2  - Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are non-specific and the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to their formation remain unclear. This study investigated brain perfusion in TBE patients using dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance perfusion imaging (DSC-MRI perfusion). Method(s): MRI scans were performed for 12 patients in the acute phase, 3-5 days after the diagnosis of TBE. Conventional MRI and DSC-MRI perfusion studies were performed. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and time to peak (TTP) parametric maps were created. The bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal subcortical regions and thalamus were selected as regions of interest. Perfusion parameters of TBE patients were compared to those of a control group. Result(s): There was a slight increase in CBF and CBV, with significant prolongation of TTP in subcortical areas in the study subjects, while MTT values were comparable to those of the control group. A significant increase in thalamic CBF (p < 0.001) and increased CBV (p < 0.05) were observed. Increased TTP and a slight reduction in MTT were also observed within this area. Conclusion(s): The DSC-MRI perfusion study showed that TBE patients had brain perfusion disturbances, expressed mainly in the thalami. These results suggest that DSC-MRI perfusion may provide important information regarding the areas affected in TBE patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors

N2  - The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic virus that becomes latent in the sensory ganglia, but later causes various neurologic complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, cranial neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy [1]. While acute cerebellitis is one of the most frequent acute cerebellar diseases associated with VZV in childhood, VZV rarely causes cerebellitis in adults, with or without skin manifestations, and only a few isolated cases of adult VZV cerebellitis have been reported. We report a case of acute cerebellitis associated with VZV infection after a herpetic rash in an 80-year-old male. Functional imaging of his cerebellum showed high blood perfusion during the acute stage of the disease, though perfusion decreased in the subacute stage.Copyright © 2018 The Authors

N2  - Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of peripheral nerves may provide additional information about nerve involvement in muscular disorders, but is considered difficult due to different optimal scan parameters tailored to magnetic resonance (MR) signal properties of muscle and neural tissues. Purpose(s): To assess the feasibility of sciatic nerve DTI using two different approaches of region of interest (ROI)-localization in DTI scans with b-values 500 s/mm2, in participants with muscular disorders and in controls. Material(s) and Method(s): DTI of the thigh was conducted on a 3T system in ten patients (6 men, 4 women; mean age =54 +/- 15 years) with neuromuscular disorders and ten controls. T1-weighted (T1W) images were co-registered to fractional anisotropy (FA) color-encoded images. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, and fiber track length (FTL) were analyzed by two operators using a freehand ROI and a single-point ROI covering the sciatic nerve. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis were used for evaluation of inter-operator and inter-technical agreement, respectively. Result(s): Three-dimensional visualization of sciatic nerve fiber was achievable using both techniques. The ICC of DTI metrics showed excellent inter-operator agreement both in patients and controls. Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement of both techniques. A maximum FTL was achieved using the single-point ROI technique, but with a lower inter-operator agreement (ICC = 0.99 vs. 0.83). The ADC and maximum FTL were significantly decreased in patients compared to controls. Conclusion(s): Both ROI localization techniques are feasible to analyze the sciatic nerve in the setting of muscular disease. A maximum FTL is reached using the single-point ROI, however, at the cost of lower inter-operator agreement.Copyright © 2017, © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2017.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this work is to examine the architectural configuration and the microstructural substrate of the cervical spine and its nerve roots with post-mortem (PM) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in non-fixed subjects and to compare these findings with histology. Method(s): Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner in five non-fixed non-trauma deaths. Two different areas were evaluated: 1) the cervical spinal cord and ventral and dorsal nerve roots with a "high in-plane" DTI and a multi-echo fast field echo protocol, and 2) the cervical peripheral nerves with an "isotropic" DTI and a 3D turbo spin echo protocol. Histology samples were obtained matching the anatomical level of the slices of the 'high in-plane' DTI protocol. Result(s): We were able to show detailed reconstructions of the dorsal and ventral nerve roots with the 'high in-plane' protocol and identified a low fractional anisotropy (FA = 0.30 +/- 0.08) in the grey matter and a high FA (0.51 +/- 0.13) in the white matter. Both grey and white matter configurations correlated with the anatomical MRI, the diffusion MRI, and with the histological sections. Using the 'isotropic' DTI protocol, it was feasible to reconstruct the spinal cord, cervical nerves, and nerve roots in all PM subjects. Conclusion(s): We were able to generate detailed architectural configurations of the ventral and dorsal nerve roots. Anatomical and diffusion MR scans showed good qualitative agreement with histology. We believe that PMDTI will be helpful in the assessment of head and neck injuries in a forensic setting.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Abstract: Magnetic resonance neurography (also called MRN or MR neurography) refers to MR imaging dedicated to the peripheral nerves. It is a technique that enhances selective multiplanar visualisation of the peripheral nerve and pathology by encompassing a combination of two-dimensional, three-dimensional and diffusion imaging pulse sequences. Referring physicians who seek imaging techniques that can depict and diagnose peripheral nerve pathologies superior to conventional MR imaging are driving the demand for MRN. This article reviews the pathophysiology of peripheral nerves in common practice scenarios, technical considerations of MRN, current indications of MRN, normal and abnormal neuromuscular appearances, and imaging pitfalls. Finally, the emerging utility of diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging is discussed and future directions are highlighted. Key points: * Lesion relationship to neural architecture is more conspicuous on MRN than MRI. * 3D multiplanar imaging technique is essential for pre-surgical planning. * Nerve injuries can be classified on MRN using Sunderland's classification. * DTI provides quantitative information and insight into intraneural integrity and pathophysiology.Copyright © 2017, European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) also known as Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease associated with severe clinical manifestations and premature death. Although rare, it is the most common autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide and has a distinct geographic distribution, reaching peak prevalence in certain regions of Brazil, Portugal and China. Due to its clinical heterogeneity, it was initially described as several different entities and as had many designations over the last decades. An accurate diagnosis become possible in 1994, after the identification of the MJD1 gene. Among its wide clinical spectrum, progressive cerebellar ataxia is normally present. Other symptoms include pyramidal syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, oculomotor abnormalities, extrapyramidal signs and sleep disorders. On the basis of the presence/absence of important extra-pyramidal signs, and the presence/absence of peripheral signs, five clinical types have been defined. Neuroimaging studies like MRI, DTI and MRS, can be useful as they can characterize structural and functional differences in specific subgroups of patients with MJD. There is no effective treatment for MJD. Symptomatic therapies are used to relieve some of the clinical symptoms and physiotherapy is also helpful in improving quality of live. Several clinical trials have been carried out using different molecules like sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, varenicline and lithium carbonate, but the results of these trials were negative or showed little benefit. Future studies sufficiently powered and adequately designed are warranted.Copyright © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

N2  - Introduction: The immune system plays a pivotal role in nerve injury. The aim of this study was to determine the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluation of the synergic effect of immunomodulation on nerve regeneration in neurotmesis. Method(s): Rats with sciatic nerve neurotmesis and surgical repair underwent serial multiparametric MR examinations over an 8-week period after subepineurial microinjection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequent subcutaneous injection of FK506 or subepineurial microinjection of LPS or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone. Result(s): Nerves treated with immunomodulation showed more prominent regeneration than those treated with LPS or PBS alone and more rapid restoration toward normal T2, fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial diffusivity (RD) values than nerves injected with LPS or PBS. Discussion(s): Nerves treated with immunomodulation exert synergic beneficial effects on nerve regeneration that can be predicted by T2 measurements and FA and RD values.

N2  - Introduction: the relationship between Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and other acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS), including acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), transverse myelitis and encephalitis, is still unclear especially when they occur in adult age. A previous study, performed on 188 pediatric cases of ADS, demonstrated that MS genetic risk loci increase the risk of pediatric-onset MS, but not of other ADS. Aim(s): to evaluate the cumulative contribution of the new set of >200 MS risk variants in the development of adult cases of ADS. Method(s): 99 incident adult-onset ADS cases have been consecutively recruited between 1996 and 2016 at National Neurological Institute of Pavia. Patients were diagnosed according to clinical, MRI and CSF findings and followed-up for a minimum of 18 months. Seven of them received other diagnoses over time: 4 converted to MS, 2 received a diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) with AQP4 positivity and 1 with HSV1-related infective encephalitis. Patients have been typed using Illumina Infinium OmniExpress BeadChip and genotypes imputed using the 1000 Genomes phase 3 ALL panel. A weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) has been calculated based on 201 MS loci, 2 additional MS SNPs emerged from the ExomeChip study and the HLA DRB1*15:01 tagging SNP rs3135388. Result(s): After quality control, 89 ADS cases, with diagnoses encompassing encephalomyelitis (n=39), myelitis (n=39) and encephalitis (n=11), were analyzed. Contemporary involvement of peripheral nervous system was detected in 31 patients. Mean age of onset was 50 years, and female:male ratio was 1.49. Patients were followed up for 7.2+/-4.2 years and, at last follow-up, 60 of them had a low disability grade (modified Rankin scale < = 2). The wGRS score of adult ADS cases was comparable to the one of 370 healthy controls (HC) (mean value=20.81 vs 20.99; p=NS), while it was significantly lower compared to the wGRS of 462 relapsing remitting MS cases (mean value=21.49; p< 0.0001). Also in terms of calculation of the Area Under the receiver operating characteristics Curve (AUC), the wGRS score did not allow to discriminate between ADS and HC, differently from MS (AUC=0.56 vs 0.697 respectively). Conclusion(s): Our study shows that the new set of MS risk alleles do not confer increased susceptibility to adult-onset ADS. Despite the small sample size, this study supports the need to consider and discriminate ADS diagnosis from MS also in adult patients.

N2  - Introduction: A schwannoma is a benign, slow growing tumor of the peripheral nervous system that originates from Schwann cells. 25%-45% of all schwannomas arise in the head and neck area, of which 1%-12% are located intraorally. This case report provides an overview of the clinical symptoms, diagnosis and therapy. Case: A 23-year-old male patient presented with a tumor located in the floor of the mouth and in the tongue. The tumor came first several years ago. Hypersalivation and a restricted articulation were reported. The patient denied the abuse of nicotine or alcohol and had no history of relevant preexisting diseases. The examination revealed a hard, indolent tumor covered by regular mucosa. The movement of the tongue was restricted and demonstrated a deviation to the left side. MRI showed a sublingual cystic mass of 5 x 5x4 cm3. Sonography revealed a tumor with echo-free and echo-rich areas and a distal sound amplification. In addition, the sonography showed a parietal perfusion of the tumor and contact to both the sublingual and submandibular glands. Botox was injected preoperatively into the big salivary glands. The tumor was excised using a transoral approach followed by plastic reconstruction of the floor of the mouth. Due to the large size of the tumor the patient remained intubated overnight. The final histopathological examination showed a schwannoma with an Antoni A pattern, and immunohistochemistry displayed a positive staining for S-100 protein. Conclusion(s): The schwannoma is a differential diagnosis of a benign neoplasm. The therapy of choice is the complete excision via transoral approach. Infrequent other approaches include cervical accesses via submandibular and transhyoid approaches. In case of complete resection, patients will remain free of recurrence.

N2  - Background: Abundant data testify to a strong association between diabetes and heart failure from non-ischemic cardiomyopathy ("diabetic cardiomyopathy") but its cause and development is not well accounted for. Autopsy studies have reported fibrosis including confluent scarring unrelated to ischemic heart disease (IHD). In patients with diabetes, previous magnetic resonance imaging studies with late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) have aimed at ischemic LGE changes, but to the best of our knowledge no larger cohort study has so far quantified non-ischaemic changes. Purpose(s): To characterize localized LGE with special emphasis on non-ischemic lesions in a broad population of patients with type 2 diabetes DM2 using LGE cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Method(s): A cross-sectional study of 268 patients with DM2 was conducted at the out-patient clinic of our Hospital. 25 age matched healthy controls. Participants were studied with echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance with LGE. All regions were verified by at least one other orthogonal plane. Two physicians analyzed the presence of LGE, a third reviewer settled disagreements. Result(s): All controls had analyzable scans without LGE. In patients with diabetes, 227 LGE scans were analyzable. Of these 49 (21.6%) had LGE changes: 26 had ischemic LGE changes (subendocardial or transmural and consistent with a coronary artery perfusion territory); 22 patients had non-ischemic LGE changes; and 1 patient had both ischemic and non-ischemic LGE changes. In 21/23 patients with non-ischemic changes, these appeared rounded, 0.5x1.5 cm, and located mid-wall in the basal and infero-lateral part of the left ventricle (LV) myocardium. 1 patient had LGE changes in the papillary muscles, and 1 patient had LGE changes located in the basal part of the inter-ventricular septum. In univariate analysis, patients with non-ischemic LGE changes were twice as likely to suffer from retinopathy (55% vs. 25%, p=0.004) with a tendency for association to peripheral neuropathy (P=0.0730) than patients without LGE lesions. Further, patients with non-ischemic LGE lesions had larger left ventricle mass (150 (95% CI 131-169) g vs. 132 (95% CI 127-137) g, p=0.022), larger left atrial maximal volume (103 (92-115) mL vs. 90 (87-93) mL, p=0.013), and higher E/e* on echocardiography (8.6 (7.1-10.3) vs. 7.3 (7.0-7.7), p=0.048) than patients without LGE. There was no difference in albuminuria, duration of diabetes or other risk factors of IHD. Conclusion(s): In patients with type 2 diabetes nearly half of identified LGE changes were not related to IHD. Identified non-ischemic changes followed a similar pattern of rounded infero-lateral lesions and were related to higher LV mass and diastolic dysfunction as well as signs of poor long-term glycemic control. We speculate the described LGE findings may be related to previous fibrosis described in autopsy studies, and hence could be specific for diabetes cardiomyopathy.

N2  - Background: Assessment of peripheral nerves with imaging methods has been increasingly used in the diagnostic approach and follow-up of patients with peripheral neuropathy. There are many types of techniques that can be used to delimitate and study nerves pathways, shape and thickness. High-resolution ultrasound (US) with a computer-aided assessment include techniques such as cross sectional area, cross sectional area variability along the anatomical course, echogenicity, vascularity and mobility of the peripheral nerves allowing detailed structural images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had a limited use because of the difficulty in delineating nerves, but now, with special software and tractography (DTI), neural tracts can be studied through three-dimensional visualization of nerve tissue. Objective(s): To present an image panel of peripheral nerve impairment in infectious peripheral neuropathies. Method(s): We conducted a review of MRI, DTI tractography and US images of patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) associated with zika virus infection and leprosy. Findings were correlated with clinical history, physical examination, electrophysiological study and nerve biopsy (leprosy cases). Result(s): DTI tractography can be very useful in the context of peripheral neuropathies as we observed; it is a non-invasive, safe and technically reproducible technology with high sensitivity for evaluation of peripheral nerves. US is a useful bedside exam is particularly wellsuited to evaluate the nerves of an entire extremity or bilateral extremities in one examination, in the evaluation of peripheral nerve disease, such as acute infectious polyneuropathy. If done with the proper technique it can reliably show enlarged sectional areas of nerves. Conclusion(s): Peripheral nerve evaluation with these imaging methods seems to be useful and promising mostly with US. Expanding their usage should be advocated as well as studies associating imaging and neurophysiological studies of the peripheral nerves in infectious diseases.

N2  - Background: Assessment of peripheral nerves with imaging methods has been increasingly used in the diagnostic approach and follow-up of patients with peripheral neuropathy. There are many types of techniques that can be used to delimitate and study nerves pathways, shape and thickness. High-resolution ultrasound (US) with a computer-aided assessment include techniques such as cross sectional area, cross sectional area variability along the anatomical course, echogenicity, vascularity and mobility of the peripheral nerves allowing detailed structural images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had a limited use because of the difficulty in delineating nerves, but now, with special software and tractography (DTI), neural tracts can be studied through three-dimensional visualization of nerve tissue. Objective(s): To present an image panel of peripheral nerve impairment in infectious peripheral neuropathies. Method(s): We conducted a review of MRI, DTI tractography and US images of patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) associated with zika virus infection and leprosy. Findings were correlated with clinical history, physical examination, electrophysiological study and nerve biopsy (leprosy cases). Result(s): DTI tractography can be very useful in the context of peripheral neuropathies as we observed; it is a non-invasive, safe and technically reproducible technology with high sensitivity for evaluation of peripheral nerves. US is a useful bedside exam is particularly wellsuited to evaluate the nerves of an entire extremity or bilateral extremities in one examination, in the evaluation of peripheral nerve disease, such as acute infectious polyneuropathy. If done with the proper technique it can reliably show enlarged sectional areas of nerves. Conclusion(s): Peripheral nerve evaluation with these imaging methods seems to be useful and promising mostly with US. Expanding their usage should be advocated as well as studies associating imaging and neurophysiological studies of the peripheral nerves in infectious diseases.

N2  - Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is characterized by impairments in metabolic and microvascular (MV) functions,1 which damage the endoneural capillaries that supply the peripheral nerves.2 Prolonged DPN can lead to local ischemic conditions in the lower extremities, causing loss of peripheral nerve integrity, neurogenic muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration, and loss of endurance.3 We have implemented novel multinuclear MRI techniques that can reliably assess skeletal muscle metabolic function, as well as MV function, levels of intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), and peripheral nerve structural integrity, which together can provide mechanistic insight into adaptations that accompany DPN (4-6). We acquired multinuclear MRI data on eight patients with DPN and seven healthy controls. All participants were scanned on a Siemens 3 T whole body MRI scanner (Siemens, Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) using a home-built dual-tuned (31P/1H) knee coil array. We used a rapid phosphorus (31P)-MRI technique to assess lower leg muscle mitochondrial function; Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD-MRI) to evaluated lower leg MV function, IDEAL MRI to quantify levels of IMAT, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess tibial, deep fibular, and superficial fibular nerve structural integrity. Patients with DPN showed distinct patterns of increased IMAT levels compared to controls, as well as prolonged phosphocreatine resynthesis rates following 90-s plantar flexion using an MRI compatible ergometer. Lower leg muscle MV function was reduced in DPN as measured with BOLD-MRI following single maximum voluntary contractions. Further, levels of fractional anisotropy in all three nerves examined were lower in DPN suggesting loss of nerve integrity. Advanced multinuclear-MRI can provide mechanistic insight into adaptations that accompany DPN. These include changes in IMAT, MV and metabolic functions of the skeletal muscle, as well as peripheral nerve function and integrity. Understanding these adaptations may help better predict patient outcomes, and develop more effective treatments for DPN.

N2  - Purpose: In vivo evaluation of peripheral nerve structure and function in rodent disease models remains a major challenge with current techniques and often provides only restricted information about disease evolution. We implemented a novel multimodal ultra high feld magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) approach as an innovative tool for non-invasive nerve assessment and disease monitoring. Method(s): Our dedicated high resolution MRN protocol was performed on a 9.4 T experimental MR-scanner comprising a set of 1) T2-weighted RARE, 2) DTI and 3) MSME sequences. This approach was applied to one of the most widely used animal models in the studyof diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of type 1 diabetes (n = 13), and quantitative results were compared to an age-and sex-matched control group (n = 10). Result(s): In the absence of gross morphologic alterations like axon-al fbre loss, a distinct MR-signature was observed in the nerves of STZ-mice which was marked by a signifcant drop in T2-time and normalized T2w-signal while other parameters such as proton density, fractional anisotropy or apparent diffusion coeffcient remained unchanged. These fndings differ greatly from the MR-signature previously reported in patients with DPN. Conclusion(s): The capacity of our MRN approach to non-invasively assess peripheral nerve structure and function within a given mouse model provides a powerful tool for direct translational comparison to human disease hallmarks not only in diabetes but also in other peripheral neuropathic conditions and may help to highlight exquisite patho-physiological differences and parallels.

N2  - Purpose: Several clinical studies have found that dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for the development of distal symmetric diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aim of this study was to visualize and quantify the impact of serum cholesterol levels on microstructural nerve remodelling in T2D DPN in vivo. Method(s): We prospectively investigated 80 T2D patients suffering from DPN. Clinical, serological and electrophysiological data were acquired. 3T magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg was performed using a T2-weighted, fat-suppressed (T2wFS) turbo-spin-echo sequence. Semi-automated nerve segmentation was performed with a subsequent correlation-analysis of all acquired parameters. Result(s): T2wFS-hypointense, lipid equivalent lesion load (LEL) corre-lated negatively with total serum cholesterol (r =-0.37;p = 0.001), HDLcholesterol (r =-0.26;p = 0.032), LDL cholesterol (r =-0.26;p = 0.037), and nerve conduction velocities of the tibial (r =-0.36;p = 0.015) and peroneal nerve (r =-0.49;p < 0.001). Patients under statin treatment showed a higher LEL compared to those without statin treatment (15.4%+/-0.02 vs. 10.2%+/-0.01;p = 0.028). No correlations were found between LEL and other risk factors for DPN such as patient's age, HbA1c levels or parameters of renal function. Conclusion(s): In contrast to previous assumptions, our fndings indicate that lowering serum cholesterol in T2D DPN causes an increase in nerve lesions and a decrease in nerve conduction velocities. These fndings may be relevant with regards to emerging therapies that promote an aggressive lowering of serum cholesterol in patients with T2D.

T1  - Entrapment syndromes in the upper extremity - Sonography

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Background: Nerve ultrasound is a proven technique for assessment of peripheral neuropathies with excellent resolution in superficial tissue layers. In experienced hands it is more sensitive than MRI in detecting peripheral nerve pathologies (93% versus 67%) and has comparable specificity (86%). Ultrasound is a valuable adjunct to electrophysiology for assessing entrapment neuropathies. It has similar sensitivity for detecting entrapments as EMG, but both techniques complement eachother by adding different types of information about the lesion, so one can describe both form and function. Method(s): For nerve size measurement, the workhorse is the transverse cross-sectional area (CSA). Because peripheral nerves can have different shapes, for example round, oval, oblong, or triangular, depending on their anatomic location, transverse CSA is more reliable and reproducible than nerve diameter measurement and is the most robust measure to confirm nerve pathology. The CSA should be measured within the hyperechoic epineurial rim that encircles the nerve fascicles. As it does not take much time to scan along the length of a nerve, it is strongly advised to scan the whole nerve during an exam, instead of just scanning a few predefined points along its course. Result(s): It is important to use the right reference value for the right patient. Ideally, a disease specific reference is available for the clinical question that needs to be answered, but if not, a population- based reference such as the p95 for CSA can also be used. Reference values for different nerves and populations are available in the literature. Conclusion(s): This talk will focus on the use of nerve ultrasound in entrapment syndromes of the upper extremities, including carpal tunnel syndrome, interosseus anterior syndrome, ulnar entrapment at the wrist and elbow, Martin Gruber anastomosis, radial nerve compression in the upper arm and supinator region, the incisura scapulae syndrome and neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. Case examples will show scanning technique, and diagnostic values will be presented where available.

N2  - Aims: Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a serious complication which was hitherto considered a disease of the peripheral nervous system. In this study we sought to investigate in detail changes in brain morphometry in DN. The aim of this study was to identify regional brain volume changes that were specific to DN (painful and painless DN) Methods: 102 patients with diabetes (34 No-DN, 34 Painless DN and 34 Painful DN) and 34 healthy volunteers underwent detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments. All subjects underwent 3-dimensional T1-weighted brain MRI (3.0T, Philips). Brain volume analysis was performed using SIENAX (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) and Freesurfer (http://surfer.nmr. mgh.harvard.edu/). Result(s): Groups were matched for age and gender. Total brain volume was significantly lower painful DN [1401.7 (10.7)ml] and painless DN [1393.5 (69.6)ml]) compared to HV [1457.2(79.2)ml] and No DN [1437.2(60.9)ml]; ANOVA p=<0.01). Total grey matter volume was significantly lower in painful DN [713.9(67.1)ml] and painless DN [717.2(42.4)ml] compared to controls (HV [758.4(46.5)]; p=<0.01; No DN [747.3(41.1)]; p=0.015). There were no significant differences in white matter (ANOVA p=0.18) and CSF (ANOVA p=0.23) volumes. Painful DN subjects had significantly lower cortical thickness in the right postcentral gyrus [1.83(0.14)mm vs. HV 1.91(0.13)mm]; (p=0.02); left precentral gyrus [2.31(0.16)mm vs. HV [2.39(0.12)mm]; (p=0.02) and no DN [2.38(0.14)mm]; (p=0.04); and left insula [2.81(0.15)mm] vs. HV [2.97(0.14)mm] p=<0.01). Conclusion(s): This is the largest cohort study of brain volume changes in subjects with DN examined to date. We have demonstrated significant reduction in grey matter volume in painful and painless DN subjects. In painful DN this is localised within the somatomotor cortex and insula. These findings highlight significant CNS involvement in DN that provides clues to the pathogenesis of this condition.

N2  - Background: Current state-of-the-art to diagnose peripheral neuropathy are neurological examination and electrodiagnostic studies. However, deeply situated nerves and plexus remain difficult to assess using these techniques, hence magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) emerged as a complementary method. MRN remains a qualitative approach and quantification, in terms of extraction of imaging biomarkers is needed to facilitate diagnosis and for followup examinations. Towards a multi-parametric quantitative imaging approach, accurate nerve segmentation needs to be performed first. Hampered by time-consuming manual annotation, we developed a semi-automatic, time-effective, hence clinically feasible segmentation approach based on machine-learning algorithms. In this study, we compared its performance on low- and high-resolution MRN. Material(s) and Method(s): We acquired images of 9 healthy volunteers at the upper leg using 3 MRN sequences: lower resolution turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM, voxel size of 78 - 78 - 4.0 mm3), lower resolution spin echo T2-weighted (T2, voxel size .52 - .52 - 4.0 mm3), and high resolution, fat-suppressed spin echo T2-weighted (hrT2, voxel size .25 - .25 - 3.3 mm3). An expert manually segmented the sciatic nerve on the T2 and hrT2 images (ground truth, GT). Our segmentation algorithm is based on a decision forest with context- and intensity-based descriptors. We split the images into two sets: a multi-modal low-resolution (TIRM and T2), and a mono-modal high-resolution (hrT2). We perform a leave-one-out cross-validation for both sets and calculate the Dice coefficient to the manually annotated GT. Cross-sectional areas (CSA) were calculated from the middle slice of the image stack. Result(s): Dice coefficients of 0.723 +/- 0.202 and 0.735 +/- 0.080 are achieved for the low- and high-resolution MRN images (p = 0.858, CI 95 %). Segmentation results and 3-D renderings of the same nerve segmented in low- and high-resolution are shown in Fig. 1. CSA for GT were 34.0 +/- 5.5 mm2 (T2), and 35.4 +/- 8.5 mm2 (hrT2), using semi-automatic segmentation 24.8 +/- 7.6 mm2 (T2), and 25.7 +/- 10.6 mm2 (hrT2). (Figure Presented) Discussion and conclusion: Semi-automatic, hence fast peripheral nerve segmentation is feasible in both low- and high-resolution MRN images of the upper leg, providing image-based quantitative morphometric data. The equal performance of the low-resolution images might be due to the multi-modal setting, which possibly provides more discriminative descriptors for nerve. The lower CSA using semi-automatic segmentation is due to more rigorous segmentation constraints. Future work will include the application of our method to localize and quantify nerve lesions in images of patients diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy.

N2  - Introduction: Through a combination of neuropathy and poor vascular perfusion, diabetic foot ulcers are a common complication of patients with established diabetes. Good glycaemic control has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of ulcers and infections [1] Case Presentation: A 63-year old man presented to hospital with an oedematous and erythematous right foot, as well as an ulcer on the base of the fifth digit, on a background of type 2 diabetes diagnosed 2 years previously. Despite his relatively new diagnosis and his well-controlled HbA1c (39mmol/mol on admission) he had pronounced sensory neuropathy bilaterally in his lower limbs.MRI of his foot revealed osteomyelitis. He also had impalpable pulses. Vascular Ultrasound with Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI) demonstrated severely calcified vessels in both legs. He was found to have a vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be associated with peripheral neuropathy. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a known side effect of Metformin, a drug which he had been taking since his diagnosis. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated a large fibre sensory axonal neuropathy consistent with diabetic neuropathy. Although rare, it has been recognised that neuropathy can precede the diagnosis of diabetes by many years [2]. He was initiated on IV antibiotics and, following clinical improvement, was discharged on outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT). Discussion(s): Diabetic foot ulcers are an important and serious complication of diabetes. While they typically occur in patients with longestablished disease, it is important to remain vigilant for other causes of neuropathy.

N2  - Objective: Describe an atypical case of ipsilateral Dejerine-Roussy syndrome(DRS) after an ischemic stroke. Background(s): Post-stroke thalamic pain was first described in 1906 by Joseph Dejerine and Gustave Roussy. Allodynia and tingling are the most frequent symptoms described. Anatomically, sensory signals originating in the peripheral nervous system decussate in different areas of the midbrain and spinal cord(SC) to reach the somatosensory cortex, causing contralateral symptoms. However, a small number of cases of ipsilateral findings have been described. Design/Methods: Case Report Results: 67 year old female with history of hypertension and diabetes presented with new-onset severe left lower extremity burning pain and tingling, associated with right-sided facial droop. Allodynia and hyperesthesia in the left lower extremity was noted on exam. Blood tests were unremarkable. CT head revealed a hazy decreased attenuation overlying the left thalamus, and brain MRI confirmed an acute infarct within the left thalamus. The presence of this thalamic stroke in the context of the patient's unilateral extremity pain suggested the diagnosis of DRS. The patient received conventional analgesic treatment with no improvement. She was started on aspirin and atorvastatin, with gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Pain decreased mildly and she was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation unit. Conclusion(s): DRS is typically associated with contralateral neuropathic pain. However, few cases of thalamic strokes leading to ipsilateral symptomatology have been reported. The exact underlying mechanism of this atypical presentation remains unclear; however, studies in other neurologic disorders causing ipsilateral symptoms have suggested a few potential theories. These theories include: (1)neuroplastic reorganization of thalamic microstructure altering the distribution of neural pathways; (2)non-decussation of neural tracts; or (3)accessory ipsilateral descending tracts with bilateral operating systems:80-90% of cortico-spinal fibers decussate along the midbrain-medullary levels, however, remaining corticospinal fibers can travel to ipsilateral ventral aspect of the SC. Conventional treatment with neuroleptic medications is the first line to achieve pain control.

N2  - Objective: To present an image panel of peripheral nerve impairment in infectious peripheral neuropathies. Background(s): Assessment of peripheral nerves with imaging methods has been increasingly used in the diagnostic approach and follow-up of patients with peripheral neuropathy. There are many types of techniques that can be used to delimitate and study nerves pathways, shape and thickness. High-resolution Ultrasound (US) with a computerized assessment include techniques such as cross sectional area, cross sectional area variability along the anatomical course, echogenicity, vascularity and mobility of the peripheral nerves allowing detailed structural images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had a limited use because of the difficulty in delineating nerves, but now, with special software and tractography (DTI), neural tracts can be studied through three-dimensional visualization of nerve tissue. Design/Methods: We conducted a review of MRI, DTI tractography and USG images of patients with Guillain- Barre syndrome (GBS) associated with Zika virus infection and leprosy. Findings were correlated with clinical history, physical examination, electrophysiological study and nerve biopsy. Result(s): DTI tractography can be very useful in the context of peripheral neuropathies as we observed; it is a noninvasive, safe and technically reproducible technology with high sensitivity for evaluation of peripheral nerves. USG is a useful bedside exam is particularly well-suited to evaluate the nerves of an entire extremity or bilateral extremities in one examination, in the evaluation of peripheral nerve disease, such as acute infectious polyneuropathy. If done with the proper technique it can reliably show enlarged sectional areas of nerves. Conclusion(s): Peripheral nerve evaluation with these imaging methods seems to be useful and promising, mostly with US. Expanding their usage should be advocated as well as studies associating imaging and neurophysiological studies of peripheral nerves in infectious diseases.

N2  - Introduction: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17 and is associated with multisistemic manifestations including susceptibility for benign and malignant tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system. NF1 patients are assessed regularly by an organised multidisciplinary team in our institution. Purpose(s): To analyse a NF 1 pediatric population followed by a multidisciplinary team, considering particularly neurological manifestations and neurosurgical care. Method(s): Review of all NF 1 cases currently followed by the Neurocutaneous Diseases multidisciplinary team in Hospital Dona Estefania. All cases included until November 2017 in the team's database were reviewed. Results were compared with other series previous published in the literature. Result(s): A total of 73 patients were included, with a median age of 11+/-5,6 years, male:female ratio being 1:1. Genetic testing was performed in 54 (74%) patients and molecular confirmation obtained in 45 (61,6%) patients. Family history was absent in 56,1% of our population. NIH criteria were formally satisfied in 89% of the patients. Nearly all (72) patients presented six or more cafe-au-lait macules, 55% presented axillary or inguinal freckling, 38% presented two or more neurofibromas or one or more plexiform neurofibromas, 27%presented Lisch nodules and 7% presented sphenoid wing or long-bone dysplasia. Regarding neuroimaging findings, 68% of the patients displayed Unidentified Bright Objects (UBOs) on cranial MRI, 11 (15%) presented scoliosis, 7 (9,5%) presented some degree of ventriculomegaly or ventricular dysmorphy. In one patient, choroid plexus hypertrophy was present. Four cases of vascular lesions were recorded, three cases of arterial stenosis and one developmental venous anomaly (AVD). Chiari type 1 malformation was present in four patients, two requiring surgery. Optic gliomas were documented in 21 (28,7%) patients, in 16 (21,9%) bilaterally. Plexiform neurofibromas were noted in 18 (24,6%) patients, involving predominantly the cervical and dorsal regions but also cranial nerves. Brain-stem lesions were found in four patients. Neurological examination was altered in 13 (17,8%) patients. Developmental delay was present in 20 (27,4%), behaviour problems in 22 (30%) and learning disabilities in 32 (43,8%) patients. Neurosurgical treatment was performed in 14 (19%) patients. The most frequent procedure was laminectomy for removal of neurofibromas, mainly cervical (6 patients), supratentorial craniotomy (3 patients) and infratentorial craniotomy (1 patient). Pathology revealed 2 pilocytic astrocytomas, 1 DNET and 1 Gangioglioma. Suboccipital craniectomy and C1 laminectomy was performed to treat a Chiari type 1 malformation. Two endoscopic third-ventriculostomies were performed and one ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed. Conclusion(s): Neurological manifestations are common in NF1. Neurosurgical intervention is required in a small group of patients. Pediatric Neurosurgeons should be part of a multidisciplinary team in the long-term management of these patients, and contribute both in imaging surveillance and surgical intervention.

N2  - Aim: Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (P-DPN) causes distressing neuropathic pain that is partially responsive to treatment. Understanding central nervous system correlates of P-DPN is vital to develop effective therapeutics. The aim of this study was to measure cerebral perfusion of pain processing areas of the brain using Magnetic resonance-Dynamic susceptibility Contrast (MR-DSC) imaging at rest and during experimental pain. Method(s): Fifty-four subjects with Type 1 diabetes [19 P-DPN, 23 painless DPN, 13 Type 1 diabetes subjects without DPN and 19 healthy volunteers (HV)] underwent MR-DSC with intravenous gadolinium-chelate contrast. Subjects were scanned at baseline and during 90s of heat-pain applied to the sensate right lateral thigh. Time-to-peak (TTP) concentration of gadolinium and DTTP was measured in the right and left thalamus (Rthal, Lthal) and right and left sensory cortex (RSC, LSC). Result(s): At baseline, mean TTP (seconds) was not statistically significant different between groups. DTTP in response to thermal pain was significantly different between the groups at the Lthal (p = 0.021), Rthal (p = 0.003), LSC (p = 0.009) and RSC (p = 0.008). There was a significant interaction effect between group and pain intensity. Plots of these interactions suggest DTTP is positively correlated to pain intensity score for P-DPN group but negatively correlated for controls. Conclusion(s): TTP measurements during an experimental painful stimulus show intriguing differences of perfusion between groups according to pain perception, which may be due to top down processing. This novel finding may serve as an objective marker of P-DPN, and in the future may facilitate the development of novel treatments.

N2  - Regenerative medicine holds the promise of engineering functional tissues or organs to heal or replace abnormal and necrotic tissues/organs, offering hope for filling the gap between organ shortage and transplantation needs. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is evolving into an unparalleled biomanufacturing technology due to its high-integration potential for patient-specific designs, precise and rapid manufacturing capabilities with high resolution, and unprecedented versatility. It enables precise control over multiple compositions, spatial distributions, and architectural accuracy/complexity, therefore achieving effective recapitulation of microstructure, architecture, mechanical properties, and biological functions of target tissues and organs. Here we provide an overview of recent advances in 3D bioprinting technology, as well as design concepts of bioinks suitable for the bioprinting process. We focus on the applications of this technology for engineering living organs, focusing more specifically on vasculature, neural networks, the heart and liver. We conclude with current challenges and the technical perspective for further development of 3D organ bioprinting.Copyright © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

N2  - From time to time it is thoughtful and productive to review a medical field and reflect upon what are the major issues that need to be addressed and what is being done to do so. This review article is not meant to be all-inclusive but rather focuses on four evolving areas in the field of peripheral nerve disorders and treatments: (1) nerve surgery under ultrasound guidance using a new ultra-minimally invasive thread technique; (2) evolving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging techniques that are helping to both diagnose and treat a variety of peripheral nerve problems including entrapment neuropathies, traumatic nerve injuries, and masses arising from nerves; (3) promoting recovery after nerve injury using electrical stimulation; and (4) developing animal models to reproduce a severe nerve injury (neurotmetic grade in continuity) that requires a surgical intervention and repair. In each area we first describe the current challenges and then discuss new and emerging techniques and approaches. It is our hope that this article will bring added attention and resources to help better address peripheral nerve problems that remain a challenge for both patients and physicians.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.

N2  - Objective: To detect and quantify lesions of the small-caliber sural nerve (SN) in symptomatic and asymptomatic transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in correlation with electrophysiologic and histopathologic findings. Method(s): Twenty-five patients with TTR-FAP, 10 asymptomatic carriers of the mutated transthyretin gene (mutTTR), and 35 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were prospectively included in this cross-sectional case-control study. All participants underwent 3T MRN with high-structural resolution (fat-saturated, T2-weighted, and double-echo sequences). Total imaging time wasz45 minutes per patient. Manual SN segmentation was performed from its origin at the sciatic nerve bifurcation to the lower leg with subsequent evaluation of quantitative microstructural and morphometric parameters. Additional time needed for postprocessing was z1.5 hours per participant. Detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic examinations were conducted in the TTR group. Result(s): T2 signal and proton spin density (r) reliably differentiated between TTR-FAP (198.06 13.3, 429.6 6 15.25), mutTTR carriers (137.0 6 16.9, p 5 0.0009; 354.7 6 21.64, p 5 0.0029), and healthy controls (90.0 6 3.4, 258.2 6 9.10; p , 0.0001). Marked differences between mutTTR carriers and controls were found for T2 signal (p50.0065) and r (p,0.0001). T2 relaxation timewas higher in patients with TTR-FAP only (p 5 0.015 vs mutTTR carriers, p 5 0.0432 vs controls). SN caliber was higher in patients with TTR-FAP vs controls and in mutTTR carriers vs controls (p , 0.0001). Amyloid deposits were histopathologically detectable in 10 of 14 SN specimens. Conclusion(s): SN injury in TTR-FAP is detectable and quantifiable in vivo byMRNeven in asymptomatic mutTTR carriers. Differences in SN T2 signal between controls and asymptomaticmutTTR carriers are derived mainly from an increase of r, which overcomes typical limitations of established diagnostic methods as a highly sensitive imaging biomarker for early detection of peripheral nerve lesions. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that MRN accurately identifies asymptomatic mutTTR carriers.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Objective. Despite modern antiretroviral therapy, HIV-associated neuropathy is one of the most prevalent, disabling and treatment-resistant complications of HIV disease. The presence and intensity of distal neuropathic pain is not fully explained by the degree of peripheral nerve damage. A better understanding of brain structure in HIV distal neuropathic pain may help explain why some patients with HIV neuropathy report pain while the majority does not. Previously, we reported that more intense distal neuropathic pain was associated with smaller total cerebral cortical gray matter volumes. The objective of this study was to determine which parts of the cortex are smaller. Methods. HIV positive individuals with and without distal neuropathic pain enrolled in the multisite (N5233) CNS HIV Antiretroviral Treatment Effects (CHARTER) study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate regional brain volumes in these structural brain images. Results. Left ventral posterior cingulate cortex was smaller for HIV positive individuals with versus without distal neuropathic pain (peak P50.017; peak t55.15; MNI coordinates x526, y5254, z520). Regional brain volumes within cortical gray matter structures typically associated with pain processing were also smaller for HIV positive individuals having higher intensity ratings of distal neuropathic pain. Conclusions. The posterior cingulate is thought to be involved in inhibiting the perception of painful stimuli. Mechanistically a smaller posterior cingulate cortex structure may be related to reduced anti-nociception contributing to increased distal neuropathic pain.Copyright © 2017, Oxford University Press.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely used to visualize peripheral nerves, but the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed using DTI. However, there are no data regarding the association among microstructural changes evaluated using DTI, the symptoms assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the duration of symptoms after surgery in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Thirty patients with unilateral radiculopathy were investigated using DTI. The changes in the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values as well as the correlation between these changes and the severity and duration of the clinical symptoms were investigated before and at least one month after surgery. The FA values were significantly increased after surgical treatment (p<0.0001). Both the ADC and ODI values were noticeably decreased (p<0.0001). A strong positive correlation between the preoperative and postoperative DTI parameters (p<0.0001) as well as between the preoperative ODI and postoperative ODI/ODI changes (p<0.0001) were found. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the changes in the DTI parameters and changes in the ODI (p<0.0001). This preliminary study suggests it may be possible to use DTI to diagnose, quantitatively evaluate and follow-up patients with LDH.

N2  - Technical advances are rapidly changing the clinical and instrumental approach to peripheral nerve diseases. Magnetic resonance neurography, diffusion tensor imaging and nerve ultrasonography are increasingly entering the diagnostic workup of peripheral neuropathies as tools that complement neurophysiology and enable investigation of proximal structures, such as plexuses and roots. Progress in the design of magnetic resonance scanners and sequences, and the development of high-frequency ultrasound probes mean that high-resolution peripheral nerve imaging is possible, enabling detailed examination of nerve size, morphology and internal fascicular structure that can integrate nerve conduction studies into clinical practice. In the growing field of small-fibre neuropathy in which traditional nerve conduction studies are of little or no use, skin biopsy has become a reliable tool for diagnosis. Corneal confocal microscopy nociceptive evoked potentials and microneurography are emerging techniques that are mainly used in clinical research settings, but have increasing relevance to clinical practice. We review these new and emerging techniques and their effects on diagnosis, treatment strategies and prognosis in a variety of peripheral neuropathies, including entrapments, brachial plexopathies, immune and inherited neuropathies, and small-fibre neuropathies. We discuss the most promising research findings and their potential for future application in clinical practice.Copyright © 2017 Macmilan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objective: To identify demographic determinants of peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to establish normal values for fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD). Method(s): Sixty subjects were examined at 3 Tesla by single-shot DTI. FA, AD, RD, and MD were collected for the sciatic, tibial, median, ulnar, and radial nerve and were correlated with demographic variables. Result(s): Mean FA of all nerves declined with increasing age (r = -0.77), which could be explained by RD increasing (r = 0.56) and AD declining (r = -0.40) with age. Moreover, FA was inversely associated with height (r = -0.28), weight (r = -0.38) and BMI (r = -0.35). Although FA tended to be lower in men than women (p = 0.052), this difference became completely negligible after adjustment to body weight. A multiple linear regression model for FA was calculated with age and weight as predictors (defined by backward variable selection), yielding an R2 = 0.71 and providing a correction formula to adjust FA for age and weight. Conclusion(s): Peripheral nerve DTI parameters depend on demographic variables. The most important determinants age and weight should be considered in all studies employing peripheral nerve DTI. Key points: * Peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters depend on demographic variables. * Fractional anisotropy (FA) declines with increasing age and weight. * Gender does not systematically affect peripheral nerve DTI. * The formula presented here allows adjustment of FA for demographic variables.Copyright © 2017, European Society of Radiology.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) refers to exercise-induced, reversible increases in pressure within well-defined inelastic fascial compartments leading to compromised tissue perfusion followed by functional loss, ischemic pain, and neurologic symptoms. Symptoms typically resolve when the activity ceases and there are usually no permanent sequelae. In the upper extremity, this condition most commonly affects athletes during sports requiring repetitive and vigorous gripping, such as rowers. In addition to clinical history and examination, a number of methods aid diagnosis, including compartment pressure measurements, magnetic resonance imaging, and near infrared spectroscopy. When symptoms persist despite conservative treatment, multiple operative techniques have been described to treat CECS including open, mini-open, and endoscopic release of involved compartments. We review the pathophysiology, diagnostic modalities, treatment strategies, and outcomes data for CECS of the upper extremity while highlighting areas of residual controversy.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Surgery of the Hand

N2  - Mutations in the NEFH gene encoding the heavy neurofilament protein are usually associated with neuronal damage and susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recently, frameshift variants in NEFH (p.Asp1004Glnfs*58 and p.Pro1008Alafs*56) have been reported to be the underlying cause of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2CC (CMT2CC). The frameshift mutation resulted in a stop loss and translation of a cryptic amyloidogenic element (CAE) encoded by the 3' untranslated region (UTR). This study also identified a de novo c.3015_3027dup frameshift mutation predicting p.Lys1010Glnfs*57 in NEFH from a CMT2 family with an atypical clinical symptom of prominent proximal weakness. This mutation is located near the previously reported frameshift mutations, suggesting a mutational hotspot. Lower limb magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed marked hyperintense signal changes in the thigh muscles compared with those in the calf muscles. Therefore, this study suggests that the stop loss and translational elongations by the 3' UTR of the NEFH mutations may be a relatively frequent genetic cause of axonal peripheral neuropathy with the specific characteristics of proximal dominant weakness.Copyright © 2017 Peripheral Nerve Society

N2  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in the measurement of peripheral nerve integrity, although the optimal way to apply the technique for the study of lumbar spinal nerves is unclear. The aims of this study are to use an improved DTI acquisition to investigate lumbar nerve root integrity and correlate this with functional measures using neurophysiology. Method(s): Twenty healthy volunteers underwent 3 T DTI of the L5/S1 area. Regions of interest were applied to L5 and S1 nerve roots, and DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity) were derived. Neurophysiological measures were obtained from muscles innervated by L5/S1 nerves; these included the slope of motor-evoked potential input-output curves, F-wave latency, maximal motor response, and central and peripheral motor conduction times. Result(s): DTI metrics were similar between the left and right sides and between vertebral levels. Conversely, significant differences in DTI measures were seen along the course of the nerves. Regression analyses revealed that DTI metrics of the L5 nerve correlated with neurophysiological measures from the muscle innervated by it. Conclusion(s): The current findings suggest that DTI has the potential to be used for assessing lumbar spinal nerve integrity and that parameters derived from DTI provide quantitative information which reflects their function.Copyright © 2017, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: While echocardiography is effective for initial identification of anatomic location, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a more advantageous modality for delineating tumor expanse, spread, and blood supply preoperatively. Emerging patterns may even help generate a specific diagnosis prior to biopsy and histopathology. Case Presentation: Our case of a 67-year-old male referred for cardiac magnetic resonance to further evaluate a cardiac mass highlights the sophisticated level of data which can be collected. Our case highlights the perfusion related findings associated with cardiac angiosarcoma. Conclusion(s): In this case, we present the diagnosis of right atrial cardiac angiosarcoma by multiple imaging modalities including MRI and subsequent angiography, allowing for prompt surgical intervention and initiation of adjuvant therapy that resulted in a survival time of 19 months.Copyright © 2017, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background The precise annotation and accurate identification of the topography of fascicles to the end organs are prerequisites for studying human peripheral nerves. New method In this study, we present a feasible imaging method that acquires 3D high-resolution (HR) topography of peripheral nerve fascicles using an iodine and freeze-drying (IFD) micro-computed tomography (microCT) method to greatly increase the contrast of fascicle images. Results The enhanced microCT imaging method can facilitate the reconstruction of high-contrast HR fascicle images, fascicle segmentation and extraction, feature analysis, and the tracing of fascicle topography to end organs, which define fascicle functions. Comparison with existing methods The complex intraneural aggregation and distribution of fascicles is typically assessed using histological techniques or MR imaging to acquire coarse axial three-dimensional (3D) maps. However, the disadvantages of histological techniques (static, axial manual registration, and data instability) and MR imaging (low-resolution) limit these applications in reconstructing the topography of nerve fascicles. Conclusions Thus, enhanced microCT is a new technique for acquiring 3D intraneural topography of the human peripheral nerve fascicles both to improve our understanding of neurobiological principles and to guide accurate repair in the clinic. Additionally, 3D microstructure data can be used as a biofabrication model, which in turn can be used to fabricate scaffolds to repair long nerve gaps.Copyright © 2017

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate large coverage magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In this prospective study, 18 patients with CIDP and 18 healthy controls were examined by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 T. Lumbosacral plexus was imaged by a T2-weighted 3D sequence and peripheral nerves of the upper and lower extremity by axial T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences. Lesions were characterized by nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) and T2-weighted signal (nT2). Additionally, T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve was performed using a multi-spin-echo sequence. All patients received a complementary electrophysiological exam. Patients with CIDP exhibited increased nerve CSA and nT2 compared to controls (p < 0.05) in a proximally predominating pattern. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed the best diagnostic accuracy for CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (AUC = 0.88) and nT2 of the sciatic nerve (AUC = 0.88). CSA correlated with multiple electrophysiological parameters of demyelinating neuropathy (F wave latency, nerve conduction velocity) of sciatic and median nerve, while nT2 only correlated with F wave latency of sciatic and not median nerve. T2 relaxometry indicated that MR signal increase in CIDP was due to an increase in proton-spin-density (p < 0.05), and not due to the increase in T2 relaxation time. Both nT2 and CSA might aid in the diagnosis of CIDP, but CSA correlates more robustly with established electrophysiological parameters for CIDP. Since the best diagnostic accuracy was shown for proximal nerve locations, MRN may be a useful complementary tool in selected CIDP cases.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

N2  - Background Peripheral neuropathies refer to a group of disorders in which there is damage to the nerves of the peripheral nervous system. Electrophysiologic studies are the main stay for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies. However, direct visualization of the nerves is possible with exact localization of site of disease with high-resolution ultrasonography (USG) and 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, and newer magnetic resonance (MR) sequences. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study including 55 patients and 64 nerves with upper limb peripheral neuropathies. All patients included underwent high-resolution focused USG of the nerves and MR neurography. A nerve conduction velocity study was performed for reference. Results The diagnostic confidence of the turbo spin echo T2-weighted (T2W) MR sequence was seen to be highest, with a sensitivity of 95.31%, whereas it was 81.25% for USG. Continuity of the nerve in patients with traumatic neuropathy was seen in 65.7% and 62.86% (22/35) nerves on MRI and USG, respectively. T1-weighted and T2W MR sequences were seen to be equally effective in establishing the continuity of the nerve. Increase in the caliber/thickening was seen in 77% of cases on MRI and 73.8% of cases on USG. Neuroma formation was seen equally on both MR and USG in 60.66%. We consistently found low fractional anisotropy (FA) values at the site of disease. Conclusions USG is a sensitive technique to diagnose peripheral neuropathies and it should be used as a screening modality for focused MR to be performed later. Turbo spin echo T2W fast spin has the highest sensitivity to identify nerve disease and is comparable with nerve conduction studies. Among the newer sequences, diffusion tensor imaging should be performed to increase diagnostic confidence.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - purpose To explore the clinical application of ladder neoadjuvant therapy in low-grade advanced colorectal cancer. method The concept of stepped neoadjuvant therapy was proposed, and the efficacy of chemotherapy-effective surgery-ineffective radiotherapyeffective surgery mode was retrospectively analyzed in 80 patients with advanced rectal cancer who received step neoadjuvant therapy. result After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, complete remission (CR) occurred in 4 cases, partial remission (PR) in 43 cases, stable (SD) in 27 cases and progression (PD) in 6 cases. The response rate was 58.8%. The main side effects of chemotherapy were myelosuppression, digestive tract reaction, liver damage, peripheral neuritis and so on. After symptomatic treatment, the patients returned to normal and only 2 patients still had symptoms of peripheral nerve paralysis. There were 25 cases of Dixon operation and 22 cases of Miles operation. The anus retention rate was 53.2%. All cases had negative margins. Thirty-three patients with SD and PD continued to receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Among them, 7 were CR, 14 were PR, 8 were SD, and 4 were PD. The response rate was 63.6%. The operation method was Dixon in 8 cases and Miles in 13 cases. The anus retention rate was 38.1%, all of which had negative margins. Preventive stoma in 8 cases, presacral infection in 2 cases, radioactive injury in 6 cases, 30 cases of sexual dysfunction. In 12 cases, there was no chance of surgery after neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In 5 cases, the chemotherapyregimen was changed after simple stoma because of incomplete intestinal obstruction, and 7 cases were directly replaced with chemotherapy regimen. in conclusion Ladder neoadjuvant therapy can reduce R 0 resection rate and 2-year survival rate under the premise of reducing the radiation injury, improve patient compliance, reduce treatment costs, so that patients can be optimized treatment.

N2  - Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of 3 T magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brachial plexus in healthy subjects. Methods Ten healthy volunteers were included, and morphological and DTI sequences of the nerve roots of the brachial plexus from C5 to T1 of both sides were repeatedly acquired on a 3 T magnetic resonance system (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). A prototype diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence-enabling slice-specific shim adjustments was performed with b-values of 0 and 800 s/mm2 in 30 gradient directions, resulting in an acquisition time of about 6 minutes each in axial orientation. Between scans, subjects were moved and repositioned in the scanner, coils were reinserted, and new localizers were acquired. Image analysis was performed using MITK Diffusion software toolkit. Two independent readers performed diffusion data postprocessing, and regions of interest (ROIs) were set on the proximal postganglionic trunk at each spinal level, bilaterally to obtain values for fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Interreader and intrareader agreement as well as test-retest reproducibility of DTI metrics were assessed. Results Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for interreader and intrareader agreement did not differ significantly between measurements for FA and MD. In particular, ICCs for interreader agreement of FA ranged from 0.741 to 0.961 and that of MD ranged from 0.802 to 0.998, and ICCs for intrareader agreement of FA ranged from 0.759 to 0.949 and that of MD ranged from 0.796 to 0.998. The test-retest reproducibility of DTI metrics showed an overall moderate to strong correlation (r > 0.707), with few minor exceptions, for both FA and MD values. Conclusions Diffusion tensor imaging metrics in the brachial plexus are reproducible. Future applications of DTI for a possible clinical use should be further investigated.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Clinical trial design in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains hampered by a lack of reliable and sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. The present study evaluated peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a surrogate marker of axonal degeneration in ALS. Longitudinal studies were undertaken in 21 ALS patients studied at 0 and 3 months, and 19 patients at 0, 3 and 6 months, with results compared to 13 age-matched controls. Imaging metrics were correlated across a range of functional assessments including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R), lower limb muscle strength (Medical Research Council sum score, MRCSS-LL), compound muscle action potential amplitudes and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Fractional anisotropy was reduced at baseline in ALS patients in the tibial (p < 0.05), and peroneal nerve (p < 0.05). Fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity declined in the tibial nerve between baselines, 3- and 6-month scans (p < 0.01). From a functional perspective, ALSFRS-R correlated with fractional anisotropy values from tibial (R = 0.75, p < 0.001) and peroneal nerves (R = 0.52, p = 0.001). Similarly, peroneal nerve MUNE values correlated with fractional anisotropy values from the tibial (R = 0.48, p = 0.002) and peroneal nerve (R = 0.39, p = 0.01). There were correlations between the change in ALSFRS-R and tibial nerve axial diffusivity (R = 0.38, p = 0.02) and the change in MRCSS-LL and peroneal nerve fractional anisotropy (R = 0.44, p = 0.009). In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that some peripheral nerve DTI metrics are sensitive to axonal degeneration in ALS. Further, that DTI metrics correlated with measures of functional disability, strength and neurophysiological measures of lower motor neuron loss.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and interobserver performance of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and detect correlations with electrophysiology. Method(s): Twelve healthy volunteers (controls) and ten DPN patients were enrolled to undergo MR examinations. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of tibial nerve (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were measured. Unpaired t test and Levene tests were performed to assess differences between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for FA and ADC values. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between DTI and electrophysiology parameters in the patient group. Result(s): The FA values of TN and CPN in the DPN group were significantly lower and ADC were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Interobserver agreement was excellent. FA positively correlated and ADC negatively correlated with motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between motor nerve conduction amplitude and DTI parameters (p > 0.05). Moderate diagnostic accuracy of DTI was seen in the diagnosis of DPN. Conclusion(s): DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy and excellent interobserver performance in the detection of DPN involving the TN and CPN. There is moderate correlation with MCV. Key Points: * FA values of TN and CPN are significantly lower in DPN. * ADC values of TN and CPN are significantly higher in DPN. * DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy in detection of DPN. * There is excellent interobserver performance in DTI measurements. * Moderate correlation is seen between DTI parameters and MCV.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate if diffusion tensor imaging MR neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect lesions of peripheral nerves in patients with type 1 diabetes. Material(s) and Method(s): Eleven type 1 diabetic patients with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 type 1 diabetic patients without polyneuropathy (nDPN), and 10 healthy controls (HC) were investigated with a 3T MRI scanner. Clinical examinations, nerve-conduction studies, and vibratory-perception thresholds determined the presence of DPN. DTI-MRN (voxel size: 1.4 x 1.4 x 3 mm3; b-values: 0, 800 s/mm2) covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions of the lower extremity (tibial nerve). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated and compared to T2-relaxometry and proton-spin density obtained from a multiecho turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated DTI reproducibility, repeatability, and diagnostic accuracy. Result(s): DTI-MRN could accurately discriminate between DPN, nDPN, and HC. The proximal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 0.37 +/- 0.06; nDPN 0.47 +/- 0.03; HC 0.49 +/- 0.06; P < 0.01). In addition, distal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 0.31 +/- 0.05; nDPN 0.41 +/- 0.07; HC 0.43 +/- 0.08; P < 0.01). Likewise, proximal ADC was highest in DPN (DPN 1.69 +/- 0.25 x 10-3mm2/s; nDPN 1.50 +/- 0.06 x 10-3mm2/s; HC 1.42 +/- 0.12 x 10-3mm2/s; P < 0.01) as was distal ADC (DPN 1.87 +/- 0.45 x 10-3mm2/s; nDPN 1.59 +/- 0.19 x 10-3mm2/s; HC 1.57 +/- 0.26 x 10-3mm2/s; P = 0.09). The combined interclass-correlation (ICC) coefficient of DTI reproducibility and repeatability was high in the sciatic nerve (ICC: FA = 0.86; ADC = 0.85) and the tibial nerve (ICC: FA = 0.78; ADC = 0.66). T2-relaxometry and proton-spin-density did not enable detection of neuropathy. Conclusion(s): DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher ADC. These alterations are likely to reflect proximal and distal nerve fiber pathology. Level of Evidence: 1. J. Magn. Reson.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics as biomarkers for the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in acute peripheral nerve injury. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty-four adult rats received subepineurial microinjection of MSCs (n = 22) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n = 22) 1 week after the sciatic nerve trunk crush injury. Sequential fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging, T2 measurement, DTI and sciatic nerve functional assessment were performed at a 3.0 Tesla MR unit over an 8-week follow-up, with histological assessments performed at regular intervals. The sciatic nerve function index, T2 value, and DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity values of the distal stumps of crushed nerves were measured and compared between the two groups. Result(s): Nerves treated with MSCs showed better functional recovery and exhibited more pronounced nerve regeneration compared with nerves treated with PBS. T2 values in nerves treated with MSCs or PBS showed a similar change pattern (P = 0.174), while FA and RD values in nerves treated with MSCs showed more rapid return (one week earlier) to baseline level than nerves treated with PBS (P = 0.045; 0.035). Nerves treated with MSCs had higher FA and lower RD values than nerves treated with PBS during the period from 2 to 3 weeks after surgery (P <= 0.0001, 0.004; P = 0.004, 0.006). Conclusion(s): FA and RD values derived from DTI might be used as sensitive biomarkers for detecting the therapeutic effect of stem cells in acute peripheral nerve crush injuries.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance neurography (DW-MRN) in the visualisation of extremity nerves in the wrist and palm. Method(s): Thirty-two volunteers and 21 patients underwent imaging of the wrist and palm on a 3-T MR scanner. In all subjects, two radiologists evaluated the image quality on DW-MRN using a four-point grading scale. Kappa statistics were obtained for inter-observer performance. In volunteers, the chi-squared test was used to assess the differences in nerve visualisation on DW-MRN and axial fat-suppressed proton density weighted imaging (FS-PDWI). Result(s): In volunteers, the mean image quality scores for the median nerve (MN) and ulnar nerve (UN) were 3.71 +/- 0.46 and 3.23 +/- 0.67 for observer 1, and 3.70 +/- 0.46 and 3.22 +/- 0.71 for observer 2, respectively. The inter-observer agreement was excellent (k = 0.843) and good (k = 0.788), respectively. DW-MRN provided significantly improved visualisations of the second and the third common palmar digital nerves and three branches of UN compared with FS-PDWI (P < 0.05). In patients, the mean image quality scores for the two observers were 3.24 +/- 0.62 and 3.10 +/- 0.83, inter-observer performance was excellent (k = 0.842). Conclusion(s): DW-MRN is feasible for improved visualisation of extremity nerves and their lesions in the wrist and palm with adequate image quality, thereby providing a supplementary method to conventional MR imaging. Key points: * DW-MRN provides adequate image quality for wrist and palm neurography * DW-MRN performs similarly to FS-PDWI in nerve visualisation at the wrist * DW-MRN provides improved visualisation of small nerves in the palm * DW-MRN serves as a supplementary method to evaluate peripheral neuropathies.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Introduction: Diet and activity are recognized as modulators of nervous system disease, including pain. Studies of exercise consistently reveal a benefit on pain. This study focused on female rats to understand differences related to metabolic status and peripheral nerve function in females. Method(s): Here, we investigated parameters of peripheral nerve function relevant to pain in rats selectively bred for high (high-capacity runners; HCR) or low endurance exercise capacity (low-capacity runners; LCR) resulting in divergent intrinsic aerobic capacities and susceptibility for metabolic conditions. Result(s): LCR female rats have reduced mechanical sensitivity, higher intraepidermal nerve fiber density and TrkA-positive epidermal axons, increased numbers of Langerhans and mast cells in cutaneous tissues, and a higher fat content despite similar overall body weights compared to female HCR rats. Sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities, thermal sensitivity, and mRNA expression of selected genes relevant to peripheral sensation were not different. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that aerobic capacity and metabolic status influence sensory sensitivity and aspects of inflammation in peripheral tissues that could lead to poor responses to tissue damage and painful stimuli. The LCR and HCR rats should prove useful as models to assess how the metabolic status impacts pain.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Investigation of peripheral neuropathies by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) may provide increased diagnostic accuracy when performed in combination with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This study seeks to evaluate DTI in the detection of neuropathic abnormalities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A). Method(s): MRI of the sciatic and tibial nerves, including MRN and DTI, was prospectively performed in 15 CMT1A patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs). The following MRI parameters were evaluated and correlated with clinical and neurophysiological findings: T2-relaxation time, proton spin density (PD) and DTI (fractional anisotropy [FA] and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]). Result(s): DTI showed lower FA and higher ADC in CMT1A compared with HCs. T2 relaxation time showed no difference; however, PD of the sciatic nerve was higher in CMT1A. There were some close associations between neuropathy severity and MRN-DTI, with the closest correlation between FA and nerve conduction velocity in the sciatic nerve (r = 0.76, P < 0.01). Discussion(s): MRN-DTI evaluation of sciatic and tibial nerves improves the detection of nerve abnormalities in patients with CMT1A.

N2  - Objective: To detect and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Method(s): Thirty-six patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing-remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease-modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age-/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. Three Tesla MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2-dimensional (2D) fat-saturated, T2-weighted (T2w) and dual echo turbo spin echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton spin density and T2 relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion. Result(s): T2w hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients, with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5 +/- 5.7 versus 19.1 +/- 2.4 in controls (p < 0.0001). Nerve proton spin density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8 +/- 7.7/368.9 +/- 8.2) versus controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0 +/- 11.0/276.8 +/- 9.7, p < 0.0001). In contrast, T2 relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal: 82.0 +/- 2.1/78.3 +/- 1.7) versus MS (tibial/peroneal: 64.3 +/- 1.0/61.2 +/- 0.9, p < 0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial: 52.4 +/- 2.1mm2, peroneal: 25.4 +/- 1.3mm2) versus controls (tibial: 45.2 +/- 1.4mm2, p < 0.0015; peroneal: 21.3 +/- 0.7mm2, p = 0.0049). Interpretation(s): Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS in vivo by high-resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton spin density and a decrease of T2 relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS.

N2  - Purpose To investigate in vivo morphological and functional correlates of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXA-PNP) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Methods Twenty patients (7 female, 13 male, 58.9+/-10.0 years) with mild to moderate OXA-PNP and 20 matched controls (8 female, 12 male, 55.7+/-15.6 years) were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent a detailed neurophysiological examination prior to neuroimaging. A standardized imaging protocol at 3.0 Tesla included the lumbosacral plexus and both sciatic nerves and their branches using T2-weighted fat-saturated sequences and diffusion tensor imaging. Quantitative assessment included volumetry of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), sciatic nerve normalized T2 (nT2) signal and caliber, and fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). Additional qualitative evaluation of sciatic, peroneal, and tibial nerves evaluated the presence, degree, and distribution of nerve lesions. Results DRG hypertrophy in OXA-PNP patients (207.3+/-47.7mm3 vs. 153.0+/-47.1mm3 in controls, p = 0.001) was found as significant morphological correlate of the sensory neuronopathy. In contrast, peripheral nerves only exhibited minor morphological alterations qualitatively. Quantitatively, sciatic nerve caliber (27.3+/-6.7mm2 vs. 27.4+/-7.4mm2, p = 0.80) and nT2 signal were not significantly changed in patients (1.32+/-0.22 vs. 1.22+/-0.26, p = 0.16). AD, RD, and MD showed a non-significant decrease in patients, while FA was unchanged. Conclusion OXA-PNP manifests with morphological and functional correlates that can be detected in vivo by MRN. We report hypertrophy of the DRG that stands in contrast to experimental and postmortem studies. DRG volume should be further investigated as a biomarker in other sensory peripheral neuropathies and ganglionopathies.Copyright © 2017 Apostolidis et al.

N2  - Background Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic brain condition involving the trigeminal nerve and characterized by severe and recurrent facial pain. Although the cause of TN has been researched extensively, there is a lack of convergence on the physiologic processes leading to pain symptoms. This review seeks to better elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of TN by analyzing the outcomes of studies that use magnetic resonance structural imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging to examine nerve damage in patients with TN. Methods Performing a structured review of the literature, the authors included human magnetic resonance anatomic and diffusion-weighted imaging studies aimed at visualizing the trigeminal nerve or measuring neural damage pertaining to TN. Studies that measured and compared nerve damage in the affected and unaffected sides in patients or patients and controls were analyzed for neural changes associated with TN. Results Twenty-five studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, the data from the anatomic and diffusion studies showed decreased volume and cross-sectional area, decreased fractional anisotropy, and increased apparent diffusion coefficient and diffusivity associated with the affected side of patients compared with the unaffected side as well as in patients compared with controls. Conclusions A review of the studies included indicates that neural differences exist between the affected and unaffected sides in patients as well as between patients and controls in both structural and diffusion metrics. The amalgamated data suggest that damage of the trigeminal nerve tissue is commonly found in patients with TN and could be a primary factor in TN pathophysiology.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate functional and morphometric magnetic resonance neurography of the dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve segments in patients with Fabry painful neuropathy. Method(s): In this prospective study, the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and proximal peripheral nerve segments of the lower extremity were examined in 11 male patients with Fabry disease by a standardized 3T magnetic resonance neurography protocol. Volumes of L3 to S2 dorsal root ganglia, perfusion parameters of L5-S1 dorsal root ganglia and the spinal nerve L5, and the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic nerve were compared to healthy controls. Result(s): Dorsal root ganglia of patients with Fabry disease were symmetrically enlarged by 78% (L3), 94% (L4), 122% (L5), 115% (S1), and 119% (S2) (p < 0.001). In addition, permeability of the blood-tissue interface was decreased by 53% (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the peripheral zone of the dorsal root ganglion containing the cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons (p < 0.001). Spinal nerve permeability showed no difference between patients with Fabry disease and controls (p = 0.7). The sciatic nerve of patients with Fabry disease at the thigh level showed an increase in cross-sectional area by 48% (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Patients with Fabry disease have severely enlarged dorsal root ganglia with dysfunctional perfusion. This may be due to glycolipid accumulation in the dorsal root ganglia mediating direct neurotoxic effects and decreased neuronal blood supply. These alterations were less pronounced in peripheral nerve segments. Thus, the dorsal root ganglion might play a key pathophysiologic role in the development of neuropathy and pain in Fabry disease.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Objective The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of Ultra-high field [UHF] 7 Tesla [T] MRI as compared to 3T MRI in non-contrast enhanced [nCE] imaging of structural anatomy in the elbow, forearm, and hand [upper extremity]. Materials and method A wide range of sequences including T1 weighted [T1] volumetric interpolate breath-hold exam [VIBE], T2 weighted [T2] double-echo steady state [DESS], susceptibility weighted imaging [SWI], time-of-flight [TOF], diffusion tensor imaging [DTI], and diffusion spectrum imaging [DSI] were optimized and incorporated with a radiofrequency [RF] coil system composed of a transverse electromagnetic [TEM] transmit coil combined with an 8-channel receive-only array for 7T upper extremity [UE] imaging. In addition, Siemens optimized protocol/sequences were used on a 3T scanner and the resulting images from T1 VIBE and T2 DESS were compared to that obtained at 7T qualitatively and quantitatively [SWI was only qualitatively compared]. DSI studio was utilized to identify nerves based on analysis of diffusion weighted derived fractional anisotropy images. Images of forearm vasculature were extracted using a paint grow manual segmentation method based on MIPAV [Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization]. Results High resolution and high quality signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]-images of the hand, forearm, and elbow were acquired with nearly homogeneous 7T excitation. Measured [performed on the T1 VIBE and T2 DESS sequences] SNR and CNR values were almost doubled at 7T vs. 3T. Cartilage, synovial fluid and tendon structures could be seen with higher clarity in the 7T T1 and T2 weighted images. SWI allowed high resolution and better quality imaging of large and medium sized arteries and veins, capillary networks and arteriovenous anastomoses at 7T when compared to 3T. 7T diffusion weighted sequence [not performed at 3T] demonstrates that the forearm nerves are clearly delineated by fiber tractography. The proper digital palmar arteries and superficial palmar arch could also be clearly visualized using TOF nCE 7T MRI. Conclusion Ultra-high resolution neurovascular imaging in upper extremities is possible at 7T without use of renal toxic intravenous contrast. 7T MRI can provide superior peripheral nerve [based on fiber anisotropy and diffusion coefficient parameters derived from diffusion tensor/spectrum imaging] and vascular [nCE MRA and vessel segmentation] imaging.Copyright © 2017 Raval et al.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Peripheral nerve conduits were fabricated from biodegradable polyurethane (PU) which was synthesized by a waterborne process. The biodegradable PU was based on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) diol and polyethylene butylene adipate diol (2:3 molar ratio) as the soft segment. Conduits formed by the freeze-drying process had asymmetric microporous structure. The PU nerve conduits were used to bridge a 10-mm gap in rat sciatic nerve. Nerve regeneration was evaluated by walking track analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrophysiological, and histological analyses. Results demonstrated that after 6 weeks, walking function was recovered by 40%. MR images showed that the transected nerve was reconnected after 3 weeks and the diameter of the regenerated nerve increased from 3 to 6 weeks. The nerve conduction velocity of the regenerated nerve reached 50% of the normal value after 6 weeks. Histological examination revealed that the cross-sectional area of the regenerated nerve at the midconduit was 0.24 mm2 after 6 weeks. The efficacy of PU nerve conduits based on functional recovery and histology was superior to that of commercial conduits (Neurotube). The PU nerve conduit developed in this study may be a potential candidate for clinical peripheral nerve tissue engineering. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Purpose of Review: This study aimed to evaluate current barriers to HIV cure strategies and interventions for neurocognitive dysfunction with a particular focus on recent advancements over the last 3 years. Recent Findings: Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) poses challenges to minimise neurotoxicity, whilst ensuring blood-brain barrier penetration and minimising the risk of cerebrovascular disease. CSF biomarkers, BCL11B and neurofilament light chain may be implicated with a neuroinflammatory cascade leading to cognitive impairment. Diagnostic imaging with diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state fMRI show promise in future diagnosis and monitoring of HAND. Summary: The introduction of ART has resulted in a dramatic decline in HIV-associated dementia. Despite this reduction, milder forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) are still prevalent and are clinically significant. The central nervous system (CNS) has been recognised as a probable reservoir and sanctuary for HIV, representing a significant barrier to management interventions.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - During the last years high-resolution nerve sonography and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) comprising peripheral diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have emerged as promising biomarkers for peripheral nervous system (PNS) visualization. Several studies have thus far conducted to investigate disease-related PNS alterations in hereditary, immune-mediated and acquired axonal neuropathies as well as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We here review those findings to discuss their impact within the clinical setting. Overall, while MRN is still experimental in nature, nerve ultrasound can already aid in the diagnosis of various neuropathies. Electrophysiology and neuromuscular ultrasound have thus to be considered as ancillary techniques that should be used in a complementary manner in the same neurophysiological lab.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

N2  - Background: Krabbe disease is a rare but severe neurodegenerative disorder mainly affecting infants. It is characterized by deficiency of galactocerebrosidase, resulting in abnormal myelination in the brain and peripheral nerves. Neurological symptoms progress quickly and often lead to death within 2 years. Currently, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only treatment available that can alter disease progression in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. Objective(s): While the benefits of transplantation have been shown using behavioral exams, this study seeks to directly investigate the longitudinal changes in cerebral myelination using brain MRI and propose a more sensitive tool that identifies disease before symptoms are evident. It also aims to measure the effects of HSCT on changes in myelin integrity. Method(s): We longitudinally scanned 55 Krabbe patients with early infantile onset, of which 14 were treated with HSCT after their first MRI scan. The scans from these 55 patients were compared to those of 255 similarly aged controls. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to assess white matter (WM) integrity of the brain. The fractional anisotropy (FA) has been shown to measure the organization of the corticospinal tracts, which are responsible for relaying action potentials from the motor cortex to the spinal cord. Lower than normal FA values indicate disorganization of myelination around the tracts. Result(s): Patients that were not treated with HSCT present with lower than normal FA and showed some increase before decreasing significantly within two years. Patients treated with HSCT generally showed normal development of the corticospinal tracts, albeit in the lower part of the normal range. The FA values are consistent with the observed motor function. Conclusion(s): FA measurements of the brain show compromised WM integrity in early infantile Krabbe patients who are not treated with HSCT. In contrast, patients who are treated with HSCT early in life show an increase in myelination of the corticospinal tract similar to, albeit lower than normal controls. This study supports using DTI as a tool to measure WM integrity and effects of treatment. Thus, this newly developed tool can be used as a marker of disease progression in neonates diagnosed through statewide newborn screening programs.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The followup study of nerve ultrasonography in patients with neurolymphomatosis has not been reported. OBJECTIVE(S): To highlight the potential usefulness of nerve ultrasonography to identify and monitor peripheral nerve infiltration in patients with lymphoma. CASE REPORT: We performed peripheral nerve ultrasonography in a patient with primary neurolymphomatosis before and after chemotherapy. The patient was a 54-year-old female with a 5-month history of asymmetric limb pain, paresthesia, and weakness. EDX studies and spinal cord MRI showed an axonal neuropathy involving the bilateral cervical and lumbosacral roots, brachial plexus, and left median nerve. Detection of malignant B lymphocytes by cytology and flow cytometry of cerebral spinal fluid confirmed the diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Nerve ultrasound showed dramatic enlargement of the upper, middle, and lower trunks of the left brachial plexus (cross sectional area [CSA] was 21 mm2, 30 mm2, and 26 mm2, respectively), middle trunk of the right brachial plexus (CSA 15 mm2), and proximal part of the left median nerve (CSA 15-18 mm2). Five months later, after 5 rounds of chemotherapy with rituximab and high-dose methotrexate, as well as intrathecal injection of cytosine arabinoside and dexamethasone, the patient had clinical improvement. Nerve ultrasound also showed alleviation of nerve enlargement. The CSAs of the upper, middle, and lower trunks of the left brachial plexus were 5 mm2, 14 mm2, and 14 mm2, respectively; the CSA of the middle trunk of the right brachial plexus was 11 mm2; the CSA of the proximal part of the left median nerve was 12-13 mm2. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve ultrasound could help locate the distribution of nerve involvement and reveal disease progression.

N2  - Introduction: Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) has been used to minimize neurosurgical morbidity during operative manipulations to prevent irreversible damage by detecting changes in the brain, spinal cord, cranial or peripheral nerves. Changes must be discovered prior to structural injury to prevent iatrogenic injury. For the changes to have meaningful sensitivity and specificity and alter the course of surgery, their morphology must be of appropriate quality; their importance in cranial surgery when monitoring motor function, depends on them providing reliable quality-assured consistent information. This technique must be standardized with minimal variance and technical differences in electrode placement relative to underlying anatomy, thereby optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Transcranial electrode placement has been crucial when localizing the motor cortex to prevent contralateral motor deficits. Generally, the Transcranial Electrical Motor Evoked Potential (TceMEP) is evoked by stimulating at the scalp at conventional sites of the 10-20 System or slightly anterior sites modified to M1-M2 and M3-M4 per MacDonald's nomenclature. Using craniometric points, close approximation of the location of the precentral (PCS) and central sulcus (CS) can be accomplished. However, during TceMEP stimulation, depending on the electrode placement selection noted, we may be close to the PCS or primary motor area but not exactly over the sulci (CSF) requiring greater current concentration. This, in addition to individual variations, can create a significant increase in the noise relative to valuable signal. To obtain anatomically-accurate stimulation, precise placement of electrodes can greatly decrease the electrical intensity needed for an evoked response along the corridor of the sulcus, leading to more accurate results with fewer false positives. With recent advances of pre-operative planning with co-registered CT/CTA/MRI sequences and intraoperative neuronavigation, more accurate and precise patient-specific placement of electrodes can be implemented. Objective(s): This study focuses on the use of navigation to more precisely identify the precentral sulcus, superior, inferior frontal sulcus and central sulcus, for the purposes of both scalp and cortical electrode placement in intracranial surgery. Material(s) and Method(s): Pre-operative and intraoperative neuromonitoring data were collected from a group of 20 patients undergoing intracranial surgery. Purpose-built 3D rendering software for cortical and subcortical mapping with segmentation of critical pathways for somatosensory, motor and cranial nerves was used to co-locate these anatomic regions and guide the optimum position of respective electrode placement. In particular, frequency of TceMEP stimulation, threshold, amplitude, and latency were measured and recorded. Data was analyzed and compared with data collected from cases not implementing the use of intraoperative navigation. Video recordings of electrode placement were also obtained. Results and Conclusion(s): Using the aforementioned methods, we have been able more accurately place electrodes over the sulcus, Precentral sulcus, Superior and inferior frontal sulcus leading to a decreased overall electrical threshold required for stimulation, thereby monitoring only those structures that are clinically relevant during the surgery. This results in much lower stimulation intensities with the benefit of significantly less patient movement in addition to optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio yielding more robust data for actionable decision making to alter the course of surgery.

N2  - Objectives: Migraine is one of the most common diseases. Medication therapy is the first choice for primary headache, but some patients show resistance for medical therapy. Recently, neuromodulation such as peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNfS) is used for the treatment of migraine and neuralgia. Further more, in the group of patients with fibromyalgia PNfS for Cervical 2 area (C2 PNfS) is reported as effective for headache, trunk pain and depression. However, PNfS requires implantation surgery, so some complications such as infection and hardware erosion were reported. In addition, the mechanism of PNfS has not yet been fully understood. In this study, we investigated whether electro-acupuncture could reproduce the effects of C2 PNfS (EAP-C2-PNfS). Method(s): A board accredited headache physician diagnosed the headache using the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rdb edition (ICHD-3b). The 36 patients were diagnosed as migraine without aura (MWoA) (4 men, 32 women, mean age 46.2+/-13.2 years-old) and they underwent 3.0T MRI (SIEMENS, Erlangen, Germany) with 32-channel head coil including Diffusion Tensor Imaging(DTI) before and after EAP-C2-PNfS. We assessed headache intensity using Numerical rating scale (NRS). We measured the impact of headache on daily disability using Short-form 36 (SF-36) and Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). We used self-rating depression scale (SDS) as the depression assessment tool. Each scale was evaluated before and after EAP-C2-PNfS. The acupuncture needles (50mm length, 0.18mm diameter, SEIRIN JSP-type, Shizuoka, Japan) were subcutaneously inserted into the bilateral occipital scalp about 15 to 20mm and biphasic electrical pulse waves were applied for 15 minutes using electrical stimulator. The EAP-C2-PNfS was performed once per a week for 3 months. The DTI were acquired by single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) (TR=6800 ms, TE=75 ms, Nex=1, GRAPPA factor=2, b values is 0 and 1000 s/mm2, 20 motion proving gradient) with 50 axial slices (slice thickness=3 mm, no gap, field of view=230+/-230 mm2, matrix size=128+/-128mm2). The DTI scan time was 5 minutes 21 seconds. For imaging analysis, we used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL). Using this software, we analyzed Fractional anisotropy (FA) in whole brain. Result(s): Clinical indexes of NRS, HIT-6, SF-36 and SDS significantly improved after 3 months of EAP-C2-PNfS. On the other hand, FA decreased at some brain regions such as right thalamus, right minor forceps, right internal capsule and bilateral corpus callosum. All subjects showed no adverse event with EAP-C2-PNfS. Conclusion(s): Recently some reports suggest that functional dysfunction and central sensitization are present in pathology of chronic headache such as migraine. In DTI studies for MWoA, the patients at interictal phase showed increased FA in bilateral thalamus compared with those of healthy control. On the other hand, there are studies that report no significant difference of FA values among 3 groups: chronic, episodic migraine and healthy control. Right hemisphere is involved in cognitive aspect of pain. Our study showed that FA decrease in right hemisphere, so EAP-C2-PNfS may be effective by inhibiting neural activity in right hemisphere. In this study, clinical indexes of headache and depression were significantly improved and right hemisphere FA decreased after EAP-C2-PNfS for 3 months. EAP-C2-PNfS is low invasive and safe procedure. This study indicated that EAP-C2-PNfS is effective by neuromodulation for MWoA.

N2  - Background: Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy(DPN) is the most common cause of chronic neuropathic pain, although the evidence of the central nervous system involvement has been scarce. Objective(s): The aim of the present study was to investigate the differences of regional grey matter volume in subjects with painful DPN. Patients and Methods/Material and Methods: Fifteen subjects with painful DPN(62.6+/-8.1 years old, 5 females, HbA1c 6.96+/-1.10%) and nineteen healthy volunteer(66.2+/-10.0 years old, 12 females) underwent three-dimensional T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging at 3.0 tesla. We conducted Voxel-based morphometry by using statistical parametric mapping(SPM)12's segmentation and Dartel normalization. The initial voxel threshold was set to .001 uncorrected. Clusters were considered as significant when falling below a cluster corrected p = 0.05(FWE). Result(s): Compared to the control group, painful DPN group demonstrated decreased grey matter volume in the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, putamen, in addition to increased grey matter volume in primary sensorimotor area. Conclusion(s): Painful DPN may affect the pain-matrix which alter the regional brain volume and may explain the pathophysiology of chronic pain in patients with neuropathy.

N2  - Background: Mutations in the NEFH gene have been reported to be associated with neuronal damage and susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recently, frameshift mutations in the NEFH (p.Asp1004Glnfs*58 and p.Pro1008Alafs*56) have been reported to be the underlying cause of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2CC (CMT2CC) in 2016. The frameshift mutation resulted in a stop loss and translational elongation of a cryptic amyloidogenic element (CAE) encoded by the 3' UTR. Objective(s): This study was performed to identify the genetic cause of an axonal CMT family. Patients and Methods/Material and Methods: We examined an axonal CMT family with 2 affected and 3 unaffected members. Whole exome sequencing was applied to the CMT family. Result(s): We identified a De novo c.3015-3027dup frameshift mutation predicting p.Lys1010Glnfs*56 in NEFH from a CMT2 family with an atypical clinical symptom of prominent proximal weakness. This mutation is located near the previously reported frameshift mutations, suggesting a mutational hot spot. Lower limb MRI revealed marked hyperintense signal changes in the thigh muscles compared to those in the calf muscles. This study also observed an anticipation pattern of earlier onset and more severe symptoms in the later generation. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that the stop loss and translational elongations by the 3' UTR of the NEFH mutations may be a relatively frequent genetic cause of axonal peripheral neuropathy with the specific characteristics of proximal dominant weakness and an anticipation pattern.

N2  - Quantitative NMR techniques of peripheral nerves have received low attention in the neuromuscular scientifi c community lately. Approximately 2.4 % of the population suffer from peripheral neuropathy, whose diagnosis relies on neurological examination and electrodiagnostic studies (EDS). Nerve segments close to the trunk remain diffi cult to assess using these techniques. Nowadays, magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is increasingly used as a complementary diagnostic tool, which enables physicians to image deeply situated nerves and its surrounding tissues. We hypothesize that quantitative measures such as volume and shape, calculated from segmented peripheral nerves, can assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral neuropathies. Therefore, we aim to develop a peripheral nerve segmentation method from MRN images. We propose a fully-automatic multi-sequence segmentation pipeline consisting of fi ve main steps: (i) pre-processing using bias fi eld correction, histogram matching, and smoothing, (ii) registration of the turbo inversion recovery magnitude to T2-weighted MRN sequence, (iii) extraction of various features including intensity and anatomical location-based descriptors, (iv) voxel-wise tissue classifi cation into peripheral nerve and background using a machine learning model based on decision forests, and (v) post-processing to obtain a fi nal segmentation of the peripheral nerves. We evaluated the performance on a cohort of six volunteers with MRN images of the upper leg using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy and the Dice coeffi cient as evaluation metric. The automated segmentation yields a Dice coeffi-cient of 0.788 +/- 0.054. Qualitatively, the overall shape of the obtained 3-D nerve reconstructions is consistent with the manually segmented ground truth. In regards to the machine learning model, an analysis of the feature importance showed that the strongest descriptors of nerve agree with the visual cues used by physicians when locating and delineating peripheral nerves. These preliminary results suggest that the proposed method is able to fully-automatically segment peripheral nerves in the upper leg with a good accuracy. Future work includes the improvement of our method by using deep learning techniques and the segmentation of peripheral nerves in other regions than the upper leg. Moreover, we will evaluate the performance of our algorithm on cohorts of patients who have been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy by EDS.

N2  - Novel therapies for motor neuron disorders (MND) require reliable and reproducible outcome measures to monitor disease progression. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent candidate due to its reproducibility and observer independence. Limited MRI data in motor-neuropathies have been published to date, mainly targeting the corticospinal tract and motor cortex, as well as muscle volumetrics in peripheral nerve disorders. No longitudinal muscle MRI studies in patients with motor-neuropathies have been published to date. In this ongoing clinical study we aim to evaluate the use of skeletal muscle MRI as a biomarker over 12 month period in patients suffering from MND, but having variable rates of disease progression: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal and bulba. 3 study groups [SBMA patients (n=20), ALS patients (n=20) and healthy controls (n=18)] have undergone 3-Tesla MRI scanning of lower limbs, upper limbs, and bulbar region at baseline. 6 and 12 months follow-up examinations are ongoing. The protocol includes semi-quantitative descriptive rating of T1-w images, and quantitative 3-point Dixon and T2-relaxometry MRI to assess muscle fatty infi ltra-tion, oedema and atrophy. MRI fi ndings will be correlated over time with functional and clinical assessments in all 3 study groups. Widespread intramuscular fat accumulation, predominantly in the SBMA patient group can be observed using both, semi-quantitative and quantitative muscle MRI approaches at baseline, with correlations of muscle fat fraction with corresponding clinical and functional assessments. We expect similar associations to be observed in the longitudinal analysis. At present, clinical trials in MND rely on binary outcome measures such as number of patients surviving at a specifi ed time point. Therefore, establish-ing biomarkers providing surrogate outcome readouts is an important step for the development of new treatments. Our study will establish the potential of muscle MRI as an outcome marker in motor-neuropathies.

T1  - Experimental therapies for canine Krabbe disease

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD), or Krabbe disease, results from a deficiency in the hydrolytic enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC), which is responsible for degrading the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS) myelin lipids galactosylceramide and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). Symptoms in infants include irritability and stiffness with disease progressing rapidly to a vegetative state and death typically resulting by 2 years of age. GLD is naturally occurring in dogs and signs include ataxia, tremors, pelvic limb paralysis, loss of hearing, and blindness, with disease progression warranting euthanasia at 15.9 +/- 4.6 weeks. Motor and sensory conduction velocities in peripheral nerves of GLD dogs are significantly reduced compared to normal and brain stem auditory evoked response testing exhibits a significant increase in central conduction time, both consistent with demyelination. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain shows T2-weighted hyperintensity of the white matter, widened sulci, and enlarged ventricles and magnetic resonance spectroscopy identified decreases in N-acetylaspartate and increases in choline. Diffusion tensor imaging established decreased fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in multiple white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and posterior internal capsule. Histologically, GLD dog brains show severe loss of myelin, a decrease in oligodendrocytes, astrogliosis, and microgliosis. Gene therapy has been evaluated in GLD affected dogs using AAVrh10 encoding canine GALC (AAVrh10-cGALC). Two GLD dogs received a low dose of AAVrh10-cGALC, 1.2E12 total vector genomes divided evenly between combination intravenous (IV) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection routes and survived to 17.9 and 22.1 weeks of age. Two additional GLD dogs were treated with an increased dose, 1.9E13 total vector genomes, and survival was further increased to 30.3 and 43.1 weeks of age. Both low and high doses prevented the onset of tremors and delayed the onset of other neurological dysfunction. High dose AAVrh10-cGALC, but not low dose, resulted in normalization of peripheral nerve conduction velocity. After high dose treatment, GALC activity reached normal levels in the cerebellum and sciatic nerve and psychosine accumulation was reduced. High dose AAV resulted in CSF psychosine concentrations lower than untreated and low dose AAV-treated GLD dogs, despite being older. Histologically, the therapy largely attenuated the loss of myelin, accumulation of storage material, and onset of neuroinflammation. AAV gene therapy targeted to the CNS and PNS delayed the onset neurological dysfunction, increased survival, and corrected pathology in the canine model of Krabbe disease.

N2  - We report a follow-up study of nerve ultrasound in a patient with primary neurolymphomatosis. A 54-year-old female presented with 5-months history of asymmetric limb pain, paresthesia, and weakness. Electrodiagnostic studies and spinal cord MRI showed an axonal neuropathy involving cervical and lumbosacral root, brachial plexus and left median nerve. Detection of malignant B lymphocytes by cytology and flow cytometry of cerebral spinal fluid confirmed the diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Nerve ultrasound showed dramatic enlargement of upper, middle and lower trunks of left brachial plexus (cross sectional area-CSAs 21 mm2, 30 mm2, 26 mm2 respectively), middle trunk of right brachial plexus (CSA 15 mm2), and proximal part of left median nerve (CSA 15-18 mm2). Five months later, after five chemotherapy of rituximab and high-dose methotrexate, and intrathecal injection of cytosine arabinoside and dexamethasone, the patient had clinical improvement. Nerve ultrasound also showed alleviation of nerve enlargement. The CSAs of upper, middle and lower trunks of left brachial plexus were 5 mm2, 14 mm2, 14 mm2 respectively; the CSA of middle trunk of right brachial plexus was 11 mm2; the CSA of proximal part of left median nerve was 12-13 mm2. Peripheral nerve ultrasound could help locate the distribution of nerve involvement, and reveals disease progression.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has long been used to evaluate the location and integrity of white matter tracts in the brain. DTI uses quantitative data and directionality of water diffusion to determine axonal connectivity of the nervous system. The technology has only recently been utilized in limited settings in the peripheral nervous system due to challenging technical factors and lack of widespread availability. Magnetic Resonance (MR) neurography or peripheral neurography is a technique which uses diffusion to differentiate between intraneural and perineural tissues. It allows for fascicle patterns to be visualized particularly in the setting of peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Peripheral nerve sheath tumors of various pathologies cause surrounding nerves to be involved or displaced in a range of directions. This technique helps determine the anatomic location of these nerve fibers in relation to the mass, which is particularly helpful at distinguishing neuromas from schwannomas. This data is invaluable to the surgeon to ensure a safe and low morbidity operation. While this technology has benefit particularly with surgical planning, it has been underutilized due to the challenges of requiring complex software to produce fiber tracks and the inability to translate these images into the operating room. Here, we utilized BrainLab software that is commonly available and utilized in surgical suites to produce images of the radial nerve fiber tracts with an associated peripheral nerve sheath tumor prior to surgical resection. While the software is commonly used in the central nervous system, it has not been reported to have been used in the peripheral nervous system. This software offers a high usability and produces anatomically correct and reliable fiber tracts. This technique overcomes the reliance on highly specialized software and extensive training required for use that most other tractography software has. Utilizing peripheral neurography in this case allowed for complete surgical resection without postoperative deficits. This data offers clinicians an option to investigate peripheral nerve fibers in various pathologic states, to plan appropriate operative trajectories to peripheral nerve pathology, and to improve surgical outcomes for patients with peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

N2  - Mutations in NEFH gene encoding the heavy neurofilament protein are usually associated with neuronal damage and susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recently, frameshift variants in NEFH (p.Asp1004Glnfs*58 and p.Pro1008Alafs*56) have been reported to be the underlying cause of the axonal CMT (CMT2CC). The frameshift mutation resulted in stop loss and translation of a cryptic amyloidgenic element (CAE) encoded by the 3' UTR. This study also identified a de novo c.3015-3027dup frameshift mutation predicting p.Lys1010Glnfs*56 in NEFH from a CMT2 family with atypical clinical symptom of proximal dominant weakness. This mutation is located near the previously reported frameshift mutations, suggesting a mutational hot spot. These relatively frequent deletion/duplication events with this resign might be caused by the putative hairpin structure. Patient's lower limb MRI revealed a marked hyperintense signal changes in the hip muscles than those in the thigh or lower leg muscles. This study also observed an anticipation pattern of earlier onset (12 yrs old for mother to 6 yrs old for daughter) and more severe symptoms in later generation. Therefore, this study suggests that the stop loss and translational elongations by the 3' UTR of the NEFH mutations may be relatively a frequent genetic cause of axonal peripheral neuropathy with the specific characteristics of proximal dominant weakness and an anticipation pattern.

N2  - High-resolution ultrasound (hFUS, 20 MHz) of peripheral nerves is a valuable non-invasive, painless complement to neurophysiology, especially in the workup of CIDP. Nevertheless, the current spatial resolution of echographic images doesn't allow a detailed study of the nerves. Ultra-high frequency ultrasound (uhFUS, 50 MHz) is a new tool with a 3-5 times higher spatial resolution than traditional hFUS. The aim of this preliminary study is to evaluate sensory and motor nerves structural characteristics found with UHFUS in patients with definite CIDP. Seven patients with CIDP underwent uhFUS nerve evaluation of median, ulnar, peroneal and sural nerves, bilaterally. US findings included: cross-sectional area of the nerve, connective tissue depth, nerve vascularization and changes in echogenicity of fascicles. Patients also underwent electroneurography (ENG) and plexus MRI. In all patients, uhFUS nerve changes were as following: CSA was increased; connective tissue was thickened. Two of the seven patients presented an epineural hypervascularization, observed at the Doppler evaluation; none of them was treated by iv immunoglobulines. Echographic changes were present even in the absence ofMRI abnormalities (root hypertrophy). ENG characteristics correlated with the US patterns. uhFUS may be of adjunctive diagnostic value in CIDP assessment. More detailed images of nerves can be obtained compared with high-frequency US, allowing a better evaluation of the internal structure of the nerve. The increased CSA observed in all our subjects seems to relate to an enlargement of connective tissue. In particular, uhFUS allows a more detailed study of nerves, demonstrating that the structural abnormalities hit connective tissue, while - conversely to previous studies - fascicles anatomy seems to be spared. We did not show nerve vascularization except in non-treated patients. We speculate that those findings may explain a preliminary involvement of connective tissue in the pathogenesis of the CIDP; our findings of nerve enlargement may be tool to monitor disease activity in CIDP, and better understand disease pathogenesis. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and additional data are being processed.

N2  - Background: Evidence suggests that energy deficit plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of Huntington disease (HD). There is however lack of robust biomarkers for testing therapeutic strategies targeting brain energy metabolism. This study therefore aims at measuring dynamic parameters of brain energy metabolism in HD. Method(s): Phase one of the study involved recruiting 10 healthy individuals for method validation. The second phase - consisting in scanning 10 presymptomatic individuals, 10 patients at the early stage of HD and 10 controls - has been initiated and will be completed by May. Following our observation of abnormal energy profile in the occipital cortex, we wish to assess the rate of brain creatine kinase using 31P magnetization transfer (31P MT). Diffusion weighted spectroscopy (DWS) is also used to evaluate the diffusion properties of metabolites that reflect distinct metabolic compartments, i.e. neuronal versus glial. Furthermore, resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) intends to capture the impact of functional connectivity on neurometabolism and vice versa. Preliminary Results: We have successfully finished the validation phase in 10 healthy volunteers. 31P MT data showed that we fully saturated gamma-ATP without directly saturating the PCr signal. Our DWS analyses displayed similar findings to other studies performed in healthy individuals. Furthermore, the rsfMRI protocol was well tolerated with no induction of peripheral nerve stimulation and the data was of high quality. We are now actively scanning HD carriers and controls. Data analyses and interpretation will be available in August.

N2  - Responsive outcome measures are needed in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) to allow adequately powered clinical trials to test novel therapeutics. We have shown high responsiveness of MRI quantified intramuscular fat accumulation in calf muscles of CMT1A patients over 12 months. The aim of the present study was to assess the responsiveness and longitudinal validity of quantitative MRI over a 4 year follow-up period. We undertook two further sets of quantitative MRI, myometric and clinical assessments in the original MRC Centre CMT1A quantitative MRI cohort. MRI sequences included fat quantification using the 3 point Dixon fat-water separation method, T2 quantification and magnetisation transfer imaging. Of the 20 patients with genetically confirmed CMT1A were assessed at baseline (11 male, mean age 42.8 +/- 13.9 years), 17 underwent repeat assessments a median on 12 months (data already published), 14 underwent repeat assessments at a median of 27 months, and 11 underwent a final assessment at a median of 49 months. The primary outcome measure currently being analysed is mean calf muscle fat fraction at a single axial slice a fixed distance distal to the knee joint. Results of this analysis and correlation with clinical measures will be presented at the Peripheral Nerve Society meeting.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate large coverage magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Method(s): In this prospective study 18 patients with CIDP and 18 healthy controls were examined by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 Tesla. Lumbosacral plexus was imaged by a T2-weighted 3D-sequence (1 mm isotropic voxel size); peripheral nerves of the upper and lower extremity by axial T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo sequences (0.5 x 0.3 mm in-plane resolution). Lesions were characterized by nerve cross sectional area (CSA) and T2-weighted signal (nT2). Additionally, T2-relaxometry of the sciatic nerve was performed using a multi-spin-echo sequence. All patients received a complementary electrophysiological exam. Result(s): Patients with CIDP exhibited increased nerve CSA and nT2 compared to controls (p < 0.05) in a proximally predominating pattern. ROC analysis revealed best diagnostic accuracy for CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (AUC = 0.88) and nT2 of the sciatic nerve (AUC = 0.88). CSA correlated with multiple electrophysiological parameters of demyelinating neuropathy (f-wave latency, nerve conduction velocity) of sciatic and median nerve, while nT2 only correlated with f-wave latency of sciatic and not median nerve. T2-relaxometry indicated that MR-signal increase in CIDP was due to increase in proton-spin-density (p < 0.05), and not increase in T2-relaxation time. Conclusion(s): Both nT2 and CSA might aid in diagnosis of CIDP, but CSA correlates more robustly with electrophysiological parameters. Since best diagnostic accuracy was shown for proximal nerve locations, MRN may be a useful complementary tool in select CIDP cases.

N2  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is traditionally viewed as a central nervous system disease. To date, there is no unequivocal evidence implicating involvement of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). This study aims to prove whether the PNS is additionally affected and if so, to detect, localize and quantify these peripheral nerve lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) by applying high-resolution MR-Neurography (MRN) with large anatomical coverage in combination with standard electrophysiological and neurological tests. We prospectively enrolled 34 patients with confirmed MS (>3 years), two patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), and 35 age-/sex-matched healthy volunteers. Any other potential causes for a concomitant polyneuropathy were excluded. AllMS patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological testing. 3 Tesla MRN with large anatomical coverage from lumbar plexus and spinal nerves down to ankle level was performed in all participants by using fat-saturated, T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo (TSE) sequences (TR/TE 5970/55 ms) and a dual echo TSE sequence for T2-relaxometry (TR 5210 ms; TE1/TE2 12/73 ms). A 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence (TR 3000 ms; effective TE 210 ms) was used for imaging of the lumbar plexus. Manual segmentation of spinal/sciatic/tibial/peroneal nerves was performed on a total of 15,975 axial slices. Besides evaluation of nerve T2w-signal, detailed quantification of nerve lesions by analyzing morphometric (nerve caliber) and microstructural markers (proton-spin-density and T2-relaxation-time) was conducted. Mean lesion load at thigh level was higher in MS (151.5+/-5.7) vs. controls (19.1+/-2.4;p<0.0001). Nerve proton-spin-density was also higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8+/-7.7 / 368.9+/-8.2) vs. controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0+/-11.0 / 276.8+/-9.7;p<0.0001). In contrast, T2-relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal: 82.0+/-2.1 / 78.3+/-1.7) vs. MS (tibial/peroneal: 64.3+/-1.0 / 61.2+/-0.9;p<0.0001). Proximal tibial and fibular nerve caliber was also significantly higher in MS (tibial: p<0.0015; fibular: p=0.0049). For the first time, PNS lesions in MS patients could be visualized and quantified in vivo by high-resolution MRN. Lesions are indicated by an increase of proton-spin-density and a decrease of T2-relaxation-time. Nerve caliber as a morphometric criterion also significantly increased. This proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathomechanism of MS and might have future implications on therapeutic approaches.

N2  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the most common autosomic recessive ataxia, due to a trinucleotide expansion within the Frataxin gene. Within the wide phenotype, FRDA patients present also with an axonal neuropathy whose pathological mechanisms are not completely known. Eight patients (5 women, mean age 34.6 yrs, range 20-45) with genetically confirmed FRDA underwent neurophysiological and nerve ultrasound evaluation at four limbs bilaterally. Echogenicity and cross-sectional area (CSA) of median, ulnar, radial, peroneal, tibial, and sural nerves were recorded.MRneurography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis were performed in one patient; fractional anisotropy (FA), radial (RD) and axial (AD) diffusivity of median, radial and ulnar nervewere calculated at proximal, intermediate and distal sites. All patients presented with sensory axonal neuropathy. Seven patients (88%) presented with increased CSA of median and ulnar nerves at arm and axilla. Mean median nerve CSA at mid-upper arm was 20.9 mm2 (normal values < 11 mm2), mean ulnar nerve CSA at mid-upper arm was 13.6 mm2 (normal values < 8 mm2). Mean median nerve CSA at axilla was 13.8 mm2 (normal values < 11 mm2), mean ulnar nerve CSA at axilla was 9.9 mm2 (normal values < 8 mm2). MR Neurography (performed in one patient) confirmed diffuse swelling and signal hyperintensity of median and ulnar nerves at the arm and DTI analysis showed abnormal values of FA, AD and RD along the whole course of evaluated nerves thus suggesting a wide alteration of nerves structure. FRDA patients presented with an axonal neuropathy characterized, at ultrasound, by a nerve enlargement strictly limited to mid-upper limbs in all patients, findings that cannot be solely explained by a dying-back axonopathy, as suggested by several authors. Neither a dorsal root ganglia neural loss could explain by itself our findings, because a diffuse CSA reduction would have been expected. On the whole, these findings represent a peculiar feature in FRDA, but its pathophysiologic meaning remains unclear.

N2  - Background and aims: Nerve conduction studies are the gold standard for evaluation of peripheral neuropathies. However, the nerves may be unexcitable in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) and the degree of severity difficult to assess. These factors indicate the need for more sensitive methods to determine the presence and severity of neuropathy in CMT. The aim of this study was to evaluate Magnetic-Resonance-Neurography (MRN) applying Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI) for the detection of abnormalities associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A). Method(s): MRN was performed in proximal and distal nerve segments of the lower extremity (sciatic and tibial nerve) in 15 patients with CMT1A and 30 healthy controls (HC). MRN consisted of conventional multi-echo MR imaging to calculate T2-relaxation-time (T2) and protonspin-density (PD), and DTI to determine fractionalanisotropy (FA) and the apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC). The findings at MRN were related to severity of neuropathy based on clinical examinations and nerve conduction studies. Sensitivity and specificity of MRN was estimated from receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC). Result(s): DTI of the peripheral nerves showed lower FA values (p<0.01) and higher ADC values (p<0.01) in CMT1A patients as compared to HC. T2 showed no difference, but the PD of the sciatic nerve was higher in patients than in controls (p<0.01). There were close associations between neuropathy severity and MRN with the closest correlation between FA and nerve conduction velocity in the sciatic nerve (R2=0.58; p<0.01). ROC analyses showed good separation of CMT1A and HC. Conclusion(s): MRN enables detection of neuropathic abnormalities in patients with CMT1A and may be considered for monitoring of the progression of disease in CMT patients.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate if diffusion-tensor-imaging MR-Neurography (DTIMRN) can detect lesions of peripheral nerves in patients with type 1 diabetes. Background(s): Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) often remains undiagnosed until advanced stages. DPN causes irreversible damage to the peripheral nerves. Early diagnosis and sensitive diagnostic techniques are needed. Method(s): Forty-nine type 1 diabetic patients (11 with severe polyneuropathy (sDPN), 13 with mild/moderate polyneuropathy (mDPN) and 25 without polyneuropathy (nDPN)) and 30 healthy controls (HC) were included. Clinical examinations, nerve-conduction-studies and vibratory-perception-thresholds described the presence and severity of DPN. DTI-MRN (voxel size: 1.4x1.4x3mm3; b-values: 0, 800 s/mm2) covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions of the lower extremity (tibial nerve). FA and ADC were calculated and compared to T2 relaxometry and proton-spin-density obtained from a multi-echo TSE sequence. Result(s): DTI-MRN could accurately discriminate between DPN, nDPN and HC. The proximal FA was lowest in sDPN (sDPN 0.38+/-0.04; mDPN 0.41+/-0.07; nDPN 0.47+/-0.02; HC 0.48+/-0.06; p<0.01). In addition, distal FA was lowest in sDPN (sDPN 0.31+/-0.08; mDPN 0.34+/-0.06; nDPN 0.41+/-0.07; HC 0.42+/-0.07; p<0.01). Likewise, proximal ADC was highest in sDPN with lower values in patients with mPDN and nDPN as well as in HC. The severity of neuropathy was correlated to DTI-MRN with a strong association of proximal (FA: R2 = 0.49, p<0.01; ADC: R2 = 0.15, p = 0.01) and distal nerve lesions (FA: R2 = 0.32, p< 0.01; ADC: R2 = 0.19; p-value < 0.01). Conclusion(s): DTI-MRN enables detection of DPN by decreasing nerve FA and increasing ADC closely related to the severity of DPN. These findings may reflect proximal and distal nerve fibre pathology. We shall further develop this novel approach for use in clinical studies and clinical practice. Previous data from our group was presented at the ADA 2016 Scientific Sessions.

N2  - In this study we investigated the feasibility of using simultaneously excited multi-slice echo planar imaging (EPI) acquired using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to delineate the peripheral nerves. Multiband (MB) EPI can excite and refocus multiple slice locations simultaneously using multiband radiofrequency excitation and refocusing pulses which can be un-aliased by exploiting the differences in coil sensitivities. We hypothesize that MB diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides excellent signal to noise ratio with the added incentive of faster scan time compared to conventional DTI. Here we aim to focus on interrogating the median nerve at the level of the elbow with MB DTI EPI using quantitative measurements of the DTI metrics. Method(s): Subjects and data acquisition: Three consented healthy volunteers were scanned at the level of the elbow on a GE 3T 60cm bore MR scanner (MR 750) using a 16 channel flexible extremity array in the superman position with MB DTI and conventional DTI. The DTI parameters for the MB are as follows: FOV: 12cmx12cm, Matrix: 128x128mm, TR/TE: 2000/57.2ms, BW: 195kHz, slice thickness: 3mm, b=0,600s/mm2, 16 gradient directions, 4 NEX, for a total scan time of 2minutes and 23 seconds. The standard DTI protocol is as follows: FOV: 12cmx12cm, Matrix: 80x40mm, TR/TE: 3500/66.1ms, BW: 167kHz, slice thickness: 3mm, b=0,600s/mm2, 16 gradient directions, 4 NEX, for a total scan time of 3minutes and 48 seconds. Tensor fitting and segmentation: The tensor fitting was conducted with DWI of b=600s/mm2 to obtain the DTI maps using DTI Studio (mristudio.org). The median nerve was extracted based on the contrast of the DTI color map using a regional growing algorithm, e.g. Fig. 1, by thresholding the FA values between 0.3 and 0.8. The fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were measured using the median nerve as a mask. Result(s): As shown in Fig. 2, the MB DTI shows improved SNR and delineation of anatomic structures compared to conventional DTI. For the MB DTI, the mean FA (0.52+/-0.04), AD (2.8x10-3mm+/-0.22), RD (1.27x10-3mm+/-0.2), MD (5.02x10-3mm2/s+/-0.94) were similar to conventional DTI mean FA (0.47+/-0.08), AD (2.21x10-3mm+/-0.18), RD (1.0 x10-3mm+/-0.0), MD (4.22x10-3mm2/s+/-0.37). There were no significant differences between MB DTI and conventional DTI for all measurements using ANOVA (p=0.42). Discussion(s): MB DTI reduces scan time with improved image quality by visual inspection compared to conventional DTI. The DTI metrics were consistent between both MB and non-MB DTI for the median nerve. Many researchers have used MB DTI in the brain, however, to our best knowledge, this is the first time that MB DTI has been reported to delineate the median nerve. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Neuromuscular ultrasound is a patient-friendly, inexpensive, point-ofcare technique with proven sensitivity and validity to help diagnose patients with a neuromuscular disorder. It is not a replacement for EMG, buth rather, as EMG is a measurement of function and ultrasound is concerned with structure, the use of both techniques is complementary; quite similar to combining EEG and MRI for CNS disorders. Nerve and muscle ultrasound can be used for screening for the presence of a neuromuscular disorder, diagnosing entrapment, tumours, inflammatory neuropathies and motor neuron disease, and is helpful as an non-invasive parameter for the follow up of patients with muscular dystrophy and assessment of respiratory muscle function. US also allows for dynamic imaging of moving muscle tissue, and can for example screen for fasciculations with high diagnostic certainty. Muscle ultrasound has a sensitivity for detecting neuromuscular disorders of 67%-86% using visual evaluation alone, and a diagnostic sensitivity for the presence of a neuromuscular disorder of over 90% using quantified analysis of grayscale values or backscatter Ultrasound scanning of peripheral nerves measures nerve size as the cross-sectional area (CSA), which can be used for determining pathology when population reference values are taken into account. Nerve ultrasound has excellent diagnostic values, and is more sensitive than MRI (93% vs 67%), with equivalent specificity (86%).

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) for the detection of neuropathy in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A). Background(s): Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is diagnosed based on clinical examination, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and genetic analysis. NCS is the golden standard for evaluation of peripheral neuropathies, however, the nerves may be inexcitable and the degree of severity is difficult to assess more precisely. These factors underscore the need for sensitive methods to determine the presence and severity of neuropathy in CMT. Design/Methods: MRN was performed in proximal and distal nerve segments of the lower extremity (sciatic and tibial nerve) in 15 patients with CMT1A and 30 healthy controls (HC). MRN consisted of conventional MR imaging to calculate T2-relaxation-time (T2) and proton-spin-density (PD) and diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) to determine fractional-anisotropy (FA) and the apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC). The findings at MRN were related to neuropathy severity based on clinical examinations and nerve conduction studies. Sensitivity and specificity of MRN was estimated from receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Result(s): In CMT1A patients, as compared to HC, DTI of the sciatic nerve showed lower FA values (HC: 0.49+/-0.06; CMT1A: 0.36+/-0.07) (p<0.01) and higher ADC values (HC: 1.42+/-0.12 x 10-3mm2/s; CMT1A: 1.67+/-0.20 x 10-3mm2/s) (p< 0.01). Similar findings were seen for the tibial nerve with lower FA values (p<0.01) and higher ADC values (p<0.01). Conventional T2 showed no difference, however, the PD of the sciatic nerve was higher in the patient group (HC: 381+/-80; CMT1A: 545+/-101) (p<0.01). There were close associations between neuropathy severity and MRN with the closest correlation between FA and nerve conduction velocity in the sciatic nerve (R2=0.58; p<0.01). ROC analyses showed good separation of CMT1A and HC. Conclusion(s): MRN examination enables detection of neuropathic abnormalities in patients with CMT1A and may prove to be a responsive measure for monitoring of the neuropathy.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate if diffusion-tensor-imaging MR-Neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect lesions of peripheral nerves in patients with type 1 diabetes. Background(s): Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication that often remains undiagnosed until advanced stages. DPN causes irreversible damage to the peripheral nerves. Thus, to prevent progression of DPN, early diagnosis is important emphasizing the need for more sensitive diagnostic techniques. Design/Methods: Forty-nine type 1 diabetic patients (11 with severe polyneuropathy (sDPN), 13 with mild/moderate polyneuropathy (mDPN) and 25 without polyneuropathy (nDPN)) and 30 healthy controls (HC) were included. Clinical examinations, nerve-conduction-studies and vibratory-perception-thresholds, determined the presence and severity of DPN. DTI-MRN (voxel size: 1.4x1.4x3mm3; b-values: 0, 800 s/mm2) covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions of the lower extremity (tibial nerve). FA and ADC were calculated and compared to T2 relaxometry and proton-spin-density obtained from a multi-echo TSE sequence. Result(s): DTI-MRN could accurately discriminate between DPN, nDPN and HC. The proximal FA was lowest in sDPN (sDPN 0.38+/-0.04; mDPN 0.41+/-0.07; nDPN 0.47+/-0.02; HC 0.48+/-0.06; p<0.01). In addition, distal FA was lowest in sDPN (sDPN 0.31+/-0.08; mDPN 0.34+/-0.06; nDPN 0.41+/-0.07; HC 0.42+/-0.07; p<0.01). Likewise, proximal ADC was highest in sDPN with lower values in patients with mPDN and nDPN as well as in HC. The severity of neuropathy was correlated to DTI-MRN demonstrating a strong association of proximal (FA: R2 = 0.49, p<0.01; ADC: R2 = 0.15, p = 0.01) and distal nerve lesions (FA: R2 = 0.32, p< 0.01; ADC: R2 = 0.19; p-value < 0.01). T2 relaxometry and proton-spin-density did not enable detection of nerve lesions. Conclusion(s): DTI-MRN enables detection of DPN by decreasing nerve FA and increasing ADC closely related to the severity of DPN. These alterations are likely to reflect proximal and distal nerve fiber pathology.

N2  - Introduction - Review the physical basis and technical specifications for the acquisition of DWI-Neurography and DTI-Neurography studies. - Show the characteristics of peripheral nerves tumors using these techniques. Material and Methods Description of the basic sequence design and technical parameters required for the acquisition of DWI and DTI-Neurography studies. Bibliographic update of the main applications of DWI and DTINeurography for assessing peripheral nerve tumors. Illustrate, by own examples, the usefulness and limitations of DWI and DTI-Neurography studies for the evaluation of this kind of lesions. Results We present examples of benign lesions (Schwannoma and Neurofibroma), malignant lesions (Neurofibrosacroma) and pseudotumoral lesions such as neuromas or intraneural ganglion cysts. The characteristic sof theselesions, both in DWI and DTI, is detailed according to the degree of restriction of diffusion (signal intensity on DWI and ADC values) and their behavior in the study of DTI (FAvalues and relationship with the rest of the nerve in the 3D neurographic reconstructions (tractography). The added value of these techniques over conventional sequences is discussed and the possible inclusion or not as a part of routine MRI protocols for assessing tumoral lesions of peripheral nerves. Conclusions DWI and DTI Neurography studies allow to improve characterization of peripheral nerve tumors from bothmorphologically (using 3D reconstructions), and functional point of view, using parameters derived from their acquisitions (ADC, FA). This manner, differential diagnosis between them can be facilitated increasing our overall diagnostic accuracy. These techniques are showing promising results and may be considered for inclusion as part of routine protocols for assessing peripheral nerve tumors.

N2  - Purpose: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common condition seen in up to 75% of individuals undergoing chemotherapy, manifesting as pain and numbness of the extremities leading to functional disability and diminished quality of life. CIPN has been related to direct and indirect physiologic effects of anti-cancer agents on peripheral nerves. Current methods of measurement of CIPN include subjective measures, clinical measures, and invasive electrodiagnostic testing which have many pitfalls. MR neurography (MRN) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) show promise in the workup of peripheral nerves. These techniques, not previously studied in CIPN, have promise as a biomarker of onset and severity of CIPN and an aid to evaluating preventive strategies. In addition, these techniques have the potential of greatly impacting diagnosis, outcome, and outlook for these patients. We investigated a possible relationship between DTI and CIPN. Material(s) and Method(s): Cancer patients on chemotherapy with and without subjective CIPN of the feet were evaluated using vibratory perception threshold (VPT) testing. A VPT score of >=25Volts defined the presence of CIPN. The posterior tibial nerve and branches in both feet were imaged using MRN and DTI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured at the posterior tibial, medial plantar and lateral plantar nerves. Measurements for the CIPN group were compared to measurements in the group without CIPN by VPT cut-off. Correlations and possible relationships between DTI parameters and CIPN were analyzed. Result(s): A total of nine patients were enrolled; a total of 15 feet were imaged (8 feet with CIPN, 7 feet without CIPN). The average age was 60.6 +/- 13.4 years (range = 33-74). The posterior tibial nerve ADC values were significantly lower than the medial plantar nerve ADC values in all feet (F = 3.50, p = 0.04). We found a correlation with FA and ADC values at specific nerve locations with CIPN, with the left medial plantar nerve FA value and left lateral plantar nerve ADC value demonstrating the strongest positive correlations (0.73 and 0.62, respectively). Conclusion(s): This pilot study provides preliminary data showing correlations between FA and ADC measurements with CIPN. MRN with DTI shows promising results as a potential objective biomarker for CIPN and may provide helpful information for patients with cancer on chemotherapy and with peripheral neuropathy. A larger, more definitive study of MRN with DTI as an objective biomarker and possible early predictor for CIPN is warranted.

N2  - Purpose: MRI of peripheral nerves around metallic hardware presents unique technical and methodologic challenges. The information gleaned from such imaging, however, is sometimes invaluable in clinical management of peripheral nerve injuries. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review a collection of recent clinical cases involving MRI of peripheral nerves around metal and to discuss the challenges, pitfalls, and current optimization techniques for such imaging. Material(s) and Method(s): IRB approval was obtained for this retrospective analysis. A search of the radiology information system was performed to identify a subset of clinical cases which highlight advances in peripheral nerve imaging around metal. Cases from our institutional peripheral nerve imaging program were selected based on the following criteria: (1) metallic hardware present nearby peripheral nerves of interest, and (2) imaging with metal artifact reduction sequences (MARS) and techniques employed. Examples of techniques employed on MRI included: careful selection of field of view, matrix and slice thickness to optimize spatial resolution, increased bandwidth to decrease distortion from metal, use of planes orthogonal to the nerve's longitudinal axis, use of 3.0 Tesla when possible given inherent increased signal to noise ratio and faster acquisition time, and others. Select patients' MR images with and without MARS were analyzed for peripheral nerve visibility, conspicuity, and for detailed characterization of nerve abnormalities, and imaging findings were correlated with medical histories. Result(s): Thirty clinical cases of peripheral nerve imaging around metallic hardware were selected as part of this work. Imaged nerves included: radial (n = 5), musculocutaneous (n = 2), median (n = 4), suprascapular (n = 3), axillary (n = 2), sciatic (n = 7), common peroneal (n = 2), tibial (n = 2), and femoral (n = 3). In several of the analyzed cases, the suspected clinical diagnosis could not be adequately diagnosed on the images acquired without the optimized metal-artifact reduction sequence and techniques. Furthermore, in a few cases, the obscured imaging findings were critical to immediate patient management. After assessing dozens of clinical cases, we found the optimal fat suppression technique for adequately visualizing nerves in the presence of metal to be a Dixon pulse sequence, which inherently provides greater SNR as compared to a STIR sequence. Dixon is also less susceptible to field inhomogeneity compared to adiabatic suppression techniques, which is particularly important when imaging the extremity, off iso-center, and large field of views such as the brachial and lumbosacral plexi. However, in cases where the nerve of interest is immediately adjacent to metallic hardware, artifact on the Dixon sequence may obscure regional anatomy, and an inversion recovery sequence may be preferred. Conclusion(s): Optimal imaging of peripheral nerves around metallic hardware is challenging but can be invaluable to patient management. Here, we identified clinical scenarios where peripheral nerves can be imaged in the presence of large metallic prostheses or when other metallic hardware obscures visualization, such as distal radius fracture fixation hardware obscuring nerves about the wrist. MRI's major advantage is its ability to directly visualize nerves in multiple planes with high spatial and contrast resolution, which affords it the ability to define cause, localize site, and grade the severity of peripheral nerve injury.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The management of peripheral nerve injuries remains a large challenge for plastic surgeons. With the inability to fuse axonal endings, results after microsurgical nerve repair have been inconsistent. Our current nerve repair strategies rely upon the slow and lengthy process of axonal regeneration (~1 mm/d). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been investigated as a potential axonal fusion agent; however, the percentage of axonal fusion has been inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to identify a PEG delivery device to standardize outcomes after attempted axonal fusion with PEG., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a rat sciatic nerve injury model in which we completely transected and repaired the left sciatic nerve to evaluate the efficacy of PEG fusion over a span of 12 weeks. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of a delivery device's ability to optimize results after PEG fusion., RESULTS: We found that PEG rapidly (within minutes) restores axonal continuity as assessed by electrophysiology, fluorescent retrograde tracer, and diffusion tensor imaging. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that motor axon counts are significantly increased at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks postoperatively in PEG-treated animals. Furthermore, PEG restored behavioral functions up to 50% compared with animals that received the criterion standard epineurial repair (control animals)., CONCLUSIONS: The ability of PEG to rapidly restore nerve function after neurotmesis could have vast implications on the clinical management of traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aims to compare engineered nerve conduits constructed from porcine-derived urinary bladder matrix (UBM) with the criterion-standard nerve autografts, for segmental loss peripheral nerve repairs., METHODS: Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups. All underwent a 10-mm sciatic nerve gap injury. This was repaired using either (1) reverse autograft-the 10-mm cut segment was oriented 180 degrees and used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps or (2) UBM conduit-the 10-mm nerve gap was bridged with UBM conduit. Behavior assessments such as sciatic function index and foot fault asymmetry scores were performed weekly. At 3- or 6-week time endpoints, the repaired nerves and bilateral gastrocnemius/soleus muscles were harvested from each animal. Nerves were evaluated using immunohistochemistry for motor and sensory axon staining and with diffusion tensor imaging. The net wet muscle weights were calculated to assess the degree of muscle atrophy., RESULTS: The UBM group demonstrated significantly improved foot fault asymmetry scores at 2 and 4 weeks, whereas there was no difference in sciatic function index. The net muscle weights were similar between both groups. Motor axon counts proximal/inside/distal to the conduit/graft were similar between UBM conduits and reverse autografts, whereas sensory axon counts within and distal to the conduit were significantly higher than those of the autograft at 6 weeks. Sensory axonal regeneration seemed to be adherent to the inner surface of the UBM conduit, whereas it had a scattered appearance in autografts. Diffusion tensor imaging parameters between groups were similar., CONCLUSIONS: Urinary bladder matrix conduits prove to be at least similar to nerve autografts for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries with a short gap. The matrix perhaps serves as a scaffold to augment sensory nerve growth., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In a clinical setting, UBM may eliminate the donor site morbidity and increased operative time associated with nerve autografting.

N2  - Objectives: Widespread sensory deficits occur in 20-40% of chronic pain patients on the side of pain, independent of pain aetiology, and are known as nondermatomal sensory deficits (NDSDs). NDSDs can occur in absence of central or peripheral nervous system lesions. We hypothesised that NDSDs were associated with cerebral grey matter changes in the sensory system and in pain processing regions, detectable with voxel-based morphometry. Method(s): Twenty-five patients with NDSDs, 23 patients without NDSDs ("pain-only"), and 29 healthy controls were studied with high resolution structural MRI of the brain. A comprehensive clinical and psychiatric evaluation based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual was performed in all patients. Result(s): Patients with NDSDs and "pain-only" did not differ concerning demographic data and psychiatric diagnoses, although anxiety scores (HADS-A) were higher in patients with NDSDs. In patients with NDSDs, grey matter increases were found in the right primary sensory cortex, thalamus, and bilaterally in lateral temporal regions and the hippocampus/fusiform gyrus. "Pain-only" patients showed a bilateral grey matter increase in the posterior insula and less pronounced changes in sensorimotor cortex. Conclusion(s): Dysfunctional sensory processing in patients with NDSDs is associated with complex changes in grey matter volume, involving the somatosensory system and temporal regions.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Background: Peripheral nerve injury is a common and important cause of morbidity and disability in patients who have suffered a traumatic injury, particularly younger people. Various different injuries can result in damage to specific nerves. In patients with multiple trauma, the prevalence of peripheral nerve injury is estimated at 2.8%, but can reach 5% with the inclusion of brachial plexus involvement. Physical examination, as well as the origin and location of the trauma, can indicate the nerve involved and the type of nerve damage. However, the depth and severity of damage, and the structures involved often cannot be determined initially, but depend on longer periods of observation to reach a definitive and accurate diagnosis for which treatment can be proposed. Current approaches to locate and assess the severity of traumatic nerve injury involve clinical and electrodiagnostic studies. From a clinical and neurophysiological point of view, nerve injuries are classified in an attempt to correlate the degree of injury with symptoms, type of pathology, and prognosis, as well as to determine the therapy to be adopted. Objective(s): MRI in the diagnosis of traumatic peripheral nerve injury has increasingly been used by surgeons in clinical practice. In this article, we analyze the use of magnetic resonance (MR) for the evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve diseases that are surgically treatable. We also consider basic concepts in the evaluation of technical and MR signs of peripheral nerve injuries. Material(s) and Method(s): Studies were identified following a computerized search of MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present), and the Cochrane database. The MEDLINE search was conducted on PUBMED, the EMBASE search was conducted on OVID, and the Cochrane database was conducted using their online library. A set was created using the terms: 'traumatic', 'nerve', and 'resonance'. Result(s): The included articles were identified using a computerized search and the resulting databases were then sorted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This yielded 10,340 articles (MEDLINE, n = 758; EMBASE, n = 9564; and Cochrane, n = 18). A search strategy was then built by excluding articles that only concern plexus injury and adding the terms 'neuropathies', 'DTI' and 'neurotmesis'. In total, seven studies were included in the review effectively addressing the role of MRI in the evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injury. We extracted all relevant information on the imaging findings and the use of magnetic resonance in trauma. We did not include technical or specific radiological aspects of the imaging techniques. Conclusion(s): These seven articles were subsequently evaluated by analyzing their results, methodological approach, and conclusions presented.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.

N2  - Traumatic conditions of peripheral nerves and plexus have been classically evaluated by morphological imaging techniques and electrophysiological tests. New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies based on 3D fat-suppressed techniques are providing high accuracy for peripheral nerve injury evaluation from a qualitative point of view. However, these techniques do not provide quantitative information. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are functional MRI techniques that are able to evaluate and quantify the movement of water molecules within different biological structures. These techniques have been successfully applied in other anatomical areas, especially in the assessment of central nervous system, and now are being imported, with promising results for peripheral nerve and plexus evaluation. DWI and DTI allow performing a qualitative and quantitative peripheral nerve analysis, providing valuable pathophysiological information about functional integrity of these structures. In the field of trauma and peripheral nerve or plexus injury, several derived parameters from DWI and DTI studies such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or fractional anisotropy (FA) among others, can be used as potential biomarkers of neural damage providing information about fiber organization, axonal flow or myelin integrity. A proper knowledge of physical basis of these techniques and their limitations is important for an optimal interpretation of the imaging findings and derived data. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the potential applications of DWI and DTI neurographic studies is performed with a focus on traumatic conditions, including main nerve entrapment syndromes in both peripheral nerves and brachial or lumbar plexus.Copyright © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

N2  - This study evaluates whether diffusion tensor imaging magnetic resonance neurography (DTI-MRN), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density can detect and grade neuropathic abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 49) were included-11 with severe polyneuropathy (sDPN), 13 with mild polyneuropathy (mDPN), and 25 without polyneuropathy (nDPN)-along with 30 healthy control subjects (HCs). Clinical examinations, nerve conduction studies, and vibratory perception thresholds determined the presence and severity of DPN. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal (tibial nerve) nerve segments of the lower extremity. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated, as were T2 relaxation time and proton spin density obtained from DTI-MRN. All magnetic resonance findings were related to the presence and severity of neuropathy. FA of the sciatic and tibial nerves was lowest in the sDPN group. Corresponding with this, proximal and distal ADCs were highest in patients with sDPN compared with patients with mDPN and nDPN, as well as the HCs. DTI-MRN correlated closely with the severity of neuropathy, demonstrating strong associations with sciatic and tibial nerve findings. Quantitative group differences in proton spin density were also significant, but less pronounced than those for DTI-MRN. In conclusion, DTI-MRN enables detection in peripheral nerves of abnormalities related to DPN, more so than proton spin density or T2 relaxation time. These abnormalities are likely to reflect pathology in sciatic and tibial nerve fibers.Copyright © 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective motor neuron degeneration in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. It is generally accepted that ALS is caused by death of motor neurons, however the exact temporal cascade of degenerative processes is not yet completely known. To identify the early pathological changes in spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 ALS mice we performed a comprehensive longitudinal analysis employing diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging alongside histology and electron microscopy, in parallel with peripheral nerve histology. We showed the gradient of degeneration appearance in spinal cord white and gray matter, starting earliest in the ventral white matter, due to a cascade of pathological events including axon dysfunction and mitochondrial changes. Notably, we found that even the main sensory regions are affected by the neurodegenerative process at symptomatic disease phase. Overall our results attest the applicability of DTI in determining disease progression in ALS mice. These findings suggest that DTI could be potentially adapted in humans to aid the assessment of ALS progression and eventually the evaluation of treatment efficacy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Neurosurgical perspectives on management of peripheral nerve tumors
A1  - Sitthinamsuwan, Bunpot

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Background: Most of peripheral nerve tumors are benign. Surgical removal is still the standard treatment and should be considered in patients with symptoms. Objective(s): The operation endeavors to excise tumors concomitant with preservation of neural function. Material(s) and Method(s): The authors reviewed medical literatures in terms of peripheral nerve tumor classification, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring and surgical treatment. Result(s): The most common peripheral nerve tumor is schwannoma. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare entity and often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Patients with peripheral nerve tumors can present with palpable mass, pain, neurological deficits and pressure symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard method for diagnosis. Ultrasonography, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tractography and electrophysiological studies are optional presurgical investigations. Operation complications can be avoided by using intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. Surgery aims to remove the tumors totally. Functional nerve fascicles must be preserved. Radical resection is necessary in MPNST to improve survival outcomes. Conclusion(s): Most of peripheral nerve tumors can be resected totally and have good prognosis. Diagnosis of the tumors is based on clinical examination and imaging studies. Malignant tumors must be treated aggressively to prolong survival rate.Copyright © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

N2  - Here, we report the structural evidence of cerebral white matter abnormalities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) patients and the relationship between these abnormalities and clinical disability. Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in CMT patients with demyelinating (CMT1A/CMT1E), axonal (CMT2A/CMT2E), or intermediate (CMTX1/DI-CMT) peripheral neuropathy. Although all patients had normal brain magnetic resonance imaging, all genetic subgroups except CMT1A had abnormal DTI findings indicative of significant cerebral white matter abnormalities: decreased fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity, and increased radial diffusivity. DTI abnormalities were correlated with clinical disability, suggesting that there is comorbidity of central nervous system damage with peripheral neuropathy in CMT patients.

N2  - Objective The neurofibromatoses (NF) type 1 and 2 are hereditary tumor predisposition syndromes caused by germline mutations in the NF1 and NF2 tumor suppressor genes. In NF1 and 2, peripheral nerve tumors occur regularly. For further characterizing nerve ultrasound was performed in patients with NF1 and 2. Methods Patients with established diagnosis of NF1 (n = 27) and NF2 (n = 10) were included. Ultrasound of peripheral nerves and cervical roots was performed during routine follow-up visits. Healthy volunteers were studied for comparison. Results In patients with NF1, median cross-sectional area (CSA) of most nerves was significantly increased compared to controls and to NF2 due to generalized plexiform tumors, which arose out of multiple fascicles in 23 of 27 patients (85%). These were often accompanied by cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas. In NF2, the overall aspect of peripheral nerves consisted of localized schwannomas (80%) and, apart from that, normal nerve segments. Conclusion Nerve ultrasound is able to visualize different nerve pathologies in NF1 and NF2. It is a precise and inexpensive screening method for peripheral nerve manifestation in neurofibromatosis and should be considered as the first choice screening imaging modality for all peripheral nerves within reach of non-invasive ultrasound techniques. Significance Ultrasound patterns of peripheral nerve pathologies are described for the first time in a large cohort of patients with NF1 and NF2. It is a suitable screening tool and enables targeted MRI analysis.Copyright © 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology

N2  - The aim of this study was to assess with MRI morphometric ultrastructural changes in nerves affected by diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). We used an MR micro-neurography imaging protocol and a semiautomated technique of tissue segmentation to visualize and measure the volume of internal nerve components, such as the epineurium and nerve fascicles. The tibial nerves of 16 patients affected by DPN and of 15 healthy volunteers were imaged. Nerves volume (NV), fascicles volume (FV), fascicles to nerve ratio (FNR), and nerves cross-sectional areas (CSA) were obtained. In patients with DPN the NV was increased and the FNR was decreased, as a result of an increase of the epineurium (FNR in diabetic neuropathy 0,665; in controls 0,699, p=0,040). CSA was increased in subjects with DPN (12,84 mm2 versus 10,22 mm2, p=0,003). The FV was increased in patients with moderate to severe DPN. We have demonstrated structural changes occurring in nerves affected by DPN, which otherwise are assessable only with an invasive biopsy. MR micro-neurography appears to be suitable for the study of microscopic changes in tibial nerves of diabetic patients.Copyright © 2017 P. F. Felisaz et al.

N2  - Aim To investigate the applicability of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance neurography (DW-MRN) in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Materials and methods In total, 47 patients with CTS (69 wrists) and 19 normal participants (38 wrists) was included in this study. Cross-sectional area (CSA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median nerves in the carpal tunnel were determined using DW-MRN. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Results No significant differences in age or body mass index (BMI) were observed between the control and CTS groups. DW-MRN imaging showed obvious hyperintensity in the lesions in CTS wrists, while other nerve regions were related to slight hyperintensity. Interobserver variability analysis indicated excellent agreement regarding both the CSA and ADC measurements for the control and CTS groups. Both the mean CSA and ADC values of the median nerves in carpal tunnel in the CTS group were significantly higher than the control group. According to the ROC analysis, the CSA cut-off value was 11.7 mm2, and sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 89.5%, respectively. Conversely, the median nerve ADC cut-off value was 1.047x10-3 mm2/s. The sensitivity and specificity were 91.3% and 76.3.9%, respectively. Conclusion DW-MRN represents a highly reproducible diagnostic technique for CTS. The ADC value of median nerves in the carpal tunnel is significantly higher in CTS patients, which provides a potential powerful tool for the disease diagnosis.Copyright © 2016

N2  - Background: In addition to fiber tracking, stereoscopic display of the peripheral nerves can be obtained based on magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using post-processing methods, including volume rendering (VR) and maximum intensity projection (MIP). However, sufficient suppression of the image noise remains a challenge. Objective(s): To achieve three-dimensional (3D) display of the peripheral nerves in the wrist region using two post-processing methods for DTI, i.e. VR reconstruction for single-direction images and the subtraction of unidirectionally encoded images for suppression of heavily isotropic objects (SUSHI); to compare the quality of images obtained via the two approaches; and to explore their clinical applications. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed DTI scans using 6 (DTI6) and 25 (DTI25) encoding diffusion directions for 20 wrists of 10 healthy adult volunteers. We used VR to reconstruct 2 types of images: 1, single-direction (anterior-posterior [AP] direction) and 2, SUSHI (AP direction with the subtraction of the superior-inferior [SI] direction). The 3D nerve image quality, noise level, and degree of noise-removal difficulty were evaluated according to custom evaluation scales. The preliminary clinical applications of these methods were explored through follow-ups with patients with nerve laceration in the wrist region. Result(s): Single-direction VR reconstruction clearly showed the nerves for both DTI6 and DTI25 but with obvious noise. In DTI25, VR reconstruction for SUSHI showed the nerves clearly with excellent nerve signal intensity. In DTI6, SUSHI post-processing lost some ulnar nerve signal intensity, resulting in a significant difference in image quality scores between single-direction images and SUSHI. Most of the noise was removed after SUSHI post-processing. Conclusion(s): VR reconstruction for both single-direction images and SUSHI using DTI25 raw data provides excellent 3D displays of the peripheral nerves in the wrist region. SUSHI post-processing is a useful denoising tool because it automatically reduces the majority of isotropic object noise.Copyright © 2016, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Iranian Society of Radiology.

N2  - Isolated traumatic oculomotor nerve palsy without internal ophthalmoplegia is a rare condition after closed head trauma. The nerve strain leads to intraneural edema with nerve swelling on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and traumatic disruption of the blood peripheral nerve barrier with contrast enhancement on T1-weighted MR images. In this patient, susceptibility-weighted MR imaging allowed the direct visualization of the intraneural hemorrhage after suspected traumatic diffuse neuronal axonal injury.Copyright © 2016 The Authors

N2  - BACKGROUND: The effect of an additional neurological injury (suprascapular nerve traction injury) to a chronically retracted rotator cuff muscle is incompletely understood and warrants clarification., PURPOSE: To investigate the microscopic and macroscopic muscle degeneration patterns caused by tendon release and/or muscle denervation in a sheep rotator cuff model., STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study., METHODS: Infraspinatus muscle biopsy specimens (for histological analysis) were obtained from 18 Swiss alpine sheep before and 16 weeks after release of the infraspinatus tendon (tenotomy [T] group; n = 6), transection of the suprascapular nerve (neurectomy [N] group; n = 6), or tendon release plus nerve transection (tenotomy + neurectomy [T&N] group; n = 6). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) were used to assess retraction (CT), muscle density (CT), volume (MRI T2), and fat fraction (MRI Dixon). Stiffness of the infraspinatus was measured with a spring scale., RESULTS: At 16 weeks postoperatively, the mean infraspinatus muscle volume had decreased significantly more after neurectomy (to 47% +/- 7% of the original volume; P = .001) and tenotomy plus neurectomy (48% +/- 13%; P = .005) than after tenotomy alone (78% +/- 11%). Conversely, the mean amount of intramuscular fat (CT/MRI Dixon) was not significantly different in the 3 groups (T group: 50% +/- 9%; N group: 40% +/- 11%; T&N group: 46% +/- 10%) after 16 weeks. The mean myotendinous retraction (CT) was not significantly different in the T and T&N groups (5.8 +/- 1.0 cm and 6.4 +/- 0.4 cm, respectively; P = .26). Stiffness was, however, most increased after additional neurectomy. In contrast to muscle changes after tendon release, denervation of the muscle led to a decrease in the pennation angle of lengthened muscle fibers, with a reduced mean cross-sectional area of pooled muscle fibers, a slow- to fast-type transformation, and an increase in the area percentage of hybrid fibers, leading to overall significantly greater atrophy of the corresponding muscle., CONCLUSION: Although it is unclear which experimental group (T or T&N) most accurately reflects the clinical scenario in a given case, these findings provide baseline information for clinical differentiation between muscle changes caused by denervation or rotator cuff tendon lesions., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings of this study help to understand how and to which extent a neurological lesion of the supplying suprascapular nerve could influence the pattern of anatomic-physiological muscular changes after rotator cuff tendon tears.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - The aim of the study was to critically review the clinical approach to distinguish the sensory and motor nerve fascicles of the peripheral nerve system and to explore potential novel techniques to meet the clinical needs. The principles and shortcomings of the currently used methods for identification of sensory and motor nerve fascicles, including nerve morphology, electrical stimulation, spectroscopy, enzymohistochemistry staining (acetylcholinesterase [AchE], carbonic anhydrase [CA] and choline acetyltransferase [ChAC] histochemistry staining methods), and immunochemical staining were systematically reviewed. The progress in diffusion tensor imaging, proteomic approaches, and quantum dots (QDs) assessment in clinical applications to identify sensory or motor fascicles has been discussed. Traditional methods such as physical and enzymohistochemical methods are not suitable for the precise differentiation of sensory and motor nerve fascicles. Immunohistochemical staining using AchE, CA, and ChAC is promising in differentiation of sensory and motor nerve fascicles. Diffusion tensor imaging can reflect morphological details of nerve fibers. Proteomics can reveal the dynamics of specific proteins discriminating sensory and motor fascicles. QDs, with their size-dependent optical properties, make them the ideal protein markers for identification of the sensory or motor nerves. Diffusion tensor imaging, proteomics and QDs-imaging will facilitate the clinical identification of motor and sensory nerve fascicles, help in improving surgical success rates and assist in postoperative functional recovery.Copyright © 2016 Neurology India  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

N2  - Purpose: Panoramical radiographs or cone-beam computed tomography (CT) are the standard-of-care in dental imaging to assess teeth, mandible, and mandibular canal pathologies, but do not allow assessment of the inferior alveolar nerve itself nor of its branches. We propose a new technique for "MR neurographic orthopantomograms" exploiting ultrashort echo-time (UTE) imaging of bone and teeth complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography. Material(s) and Method(s): The Institutional Review Board approved the study in 10 healthy volunteers. Imaging of the subjects mandibles at 3.0T (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens-Healthcare) using a 64-channel head coil with isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar reformatting, was performed. Bone images were acquired using a 3D PETRA sequence (TE, 0.07 msec). Morphological nerve imaging was performed using a dedicated 3D PSIF and 3D SPACE STIR sequence. Functional MR neurography was accomplished using a new accelerated diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) prototype sequence (2D SMS-accelerated RESOLVE). Qualitative and quantitative image analysis was performed and descriptive statistics are provided. Result(s): Image acquisition and subsequent postprocessing into the MR neurographic orthopantomogram by overlay of morphological and functional images were feasible in all 10 volunteers without artifacts. All mandibular bones and mandibular nerves were assessable and considered normal. Fiber tractography with quantitative evaluation of physiological diffusion properties of mandibular nerves yielded the following mean +/- SD values: fractional anisotropy, 0.43 +/- 0.07; mean diffusivity (mm2/s), 0.0014 +/- 0.0002; axial diffusivity, 0.0020 +/- 0.0002, and radial diffusivity, 0.0011 +/- 0.0001. Conclusion(s): The proposed technique of MR neurographic orthopantomogram exploiting UTE imaging complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography was feasible and allowed comprehensive assessment of osseous texture and neural microarchitecture in a single examination.

N2  - Introduction: We investigated whether MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of the cervical spinal cord could aid the (differential) diagnosis of sensory neuronopathies, an underdiagnosed group of diseases of the peripheral nervous system. Method(s): We obtained spinal cord DTI and T2WI at 3 T from 28 patients, 14 diabetic subjects with sensory-motor distal polyneuropathy, and 20 healthy controls. We quantified DTI-based parameters and looked at the hyperintense T2W signal at the spinal cord posterior columns. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values at C2-C3 and C3-C4 levels were compared between groups. We also compared average fractional anisotropy (mean of values at C2-C3 and C3-C4 levels). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine diagnostic accuracy of average fractional anisotropy, and we compared its sensitivity against the hyperintense signal in segregating patients from the other subjects. Result(s): Mean age and disease duration were 52 +/- 10 and 11.4 +/- 9.3 years in the patient group. Eighteen subjects had idiopathic disease and 6 dysimmune etiology. Fractional anisotropy at C3-C4 level and average fractional anisotropy were significantly different between patients and healthy controls (p < 0.001 and <0.001) and between patients and diabetic subjects (p = 0.019 and 0.027). Average fractional anisotropy presented an area under the curve of 0.838. Moreover, it had higher sensitivity than visual detection of the hyperintense signal (0.86 vs. 0.54), particularly for patients with short disease duration. Conclusion(s): DTI-based analysis enables in vivo detection of posterior column damage in sensory neuronopathy patients and is a useful diagnostic test for this condition. It also helps the differential diagnosis between sensory neuronopathy and distal polyneuropathies.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Purpose To develop an in-vivo imaging method for the measurement of dorsal-root-ganglia-(DRG) perfusion, to establish its normal values in patients without known peripheral nerve disorders or radicular pain syndromes and to determine the physiological spatial perfusion pattern within the DRG. Methods This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. 46 (24 female, 22 male, mean age 46.0 +/- 15.2 years) subjects without known peripheral neuropathies or pain syndromes were examined by a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom VERIO or TRIO, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) with a VIBE (Volume-Interpolated-Breathhold-Examination) dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) T1-w-sequence (TR/TE 3.3/1.11 ms; 24 slices; voxel resolution 1.3 x 1.3 x 3.0 mm3) covered the pelvis from the upper plate of the 5th lumbar vertebra to the 2nd sacral vertebra. Transfer-constant (Ktrans) and interstitial-volume-fraction (interstitial-leakage-fraction, Ve) were modeled for the DRG and spinal nerve by applying the Tofts-model. Statistical analyses included pairwise comparisons of L5/S1 DRG vs. spinal nerve. Furthermore, distinct physiological zones within the S1 DRG were compared (cell body rich area (CBRA) vs. nerve fiber rich area (NFRA)). Results DRG showed a significantly increased permeability compared to spinal nerve (Ktrans 3.8 +/- 1.5 10- 3/min vs. 1.6 +/- 0.9 10- 3/min, p-value: < 0.001) combined with an increased interstitial leakage of contrast agent into the extravascular-extracellular-space (Ve 38.1 +/- 19.2% vs. 17.3 +/- 9.9%, p-value: < 0.001). Parameters showed no statistically significant difference on DRG-level (L5 vs. S1; p-value: 0.62 (Ktrans); 0.17 (Ve)) and -side (left vs. right; p-value: 0.25 (Ktrans); 0.79 (Ve)). Female gender was associated with a significantly increased permeability (Ktrans female 4.3 +/- 1.4 10- 3/min vs. male 3.4 +/- 0.9 10- 3/min, p-value: < 0.05) but no statistically significant differences in interstitial leakage (Ve female 40.1 +/- 14,1% vs. male 34.5 +/- 17.4%, p-value: 0.24). DRG showed distinct spatial distribution patterns of perfusion: Ktrans and Ve were significantly higher in the CBRA than in the NFRA (Ktrans 4.4 +/- 1.8 10- 3/min vs. 1.7 +/- 1.2 10- 3/min, p-value: < 0.001 and Ve 40.9 +/- 21.3% vs. 15.1 +/- 11.7%, p-value: < 0.001). Conclusion Non-invasive and in-vivo measurement of human DRG perfusion by MRI is a feasible technique. DRG show substantially higher permeability and interstitial leakage than spinal nerves. Even distinct physiological perfusion patterns for different microstructural compartments could be observed within the DRG. The technique may become particularly useful for future research on the poorly understood human sensory neuropathies and pain syndromes.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown that fractional anisotropy (FA) is lower in peripheral nerves in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We examined whether DTI correlates to muscle strength or impairment. Method(s): MRI of sciatic and tibial nerves was performed on 3-T MR scanner by obtaining T2- and DTI-weighted sequences with fat saturation. On each slice of T2-weighted (T2w) and DTI, the tibial and sciatic nerves were segmented and served for calculation of signal intensity. On DTI images, pixel-by-pixel calculation of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was done. Muscle strength at knee and ankle was determined by isokinetic dynamometry and severity of CIDP by neuropathy impairment score (NIS). Result(s): Fourteen CIDP patients treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin were compared to gender- and age-matched controls. T2w values expressed as a nerve/muscle ratio (nT2w) were unchanged in CIDP versus controls 0.93 +/- 0.21 versus 1.02 +/- 0.21 (P = 0.10). FA values were lower in CIDP compared to controls 0.38 +/- 0.07 versus 0.45 +/- 0.05 (P < 0.0001), and ADC values were higher in CIDP versus controls 1735 +/- 232 versus 1593 +/- 116 x 10-6 mm2/s (P = 0.005). In CIDP, FA values correlated to clinical impairment (NIS) (r = -0.57, P = 0.03), but not to muscle strength. FA value in the sciatic nerve distinguishes CIDP from controls with a sensitivity and a specificity of 92.9 %. Conclusion(s): CIDP patients have unchanged nT2w values, lower FA values, and higher ADC values of sciatic and tibial nerves compared to controls. FA values correlated to NIS but were unrelated to muscle strength. DTI of sciatic nerves seems promising to differentiate CIDP from controls.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Objectives: This study reports on a patient who developed degeneration of an injured spinothalamic tract (STT) detected on diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Case description: A 56-year-old female had suffered from head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident. The patient did not experience loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia and the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. She had begun to feel pain in her left hand and foot at ~ 7 days after onset. The characteristics and severity of pain were as follows: constant tingling and pricking sensation without allodynia or hyperalgesia (Visual Analogue Scale score: 3~4). No specific focal lesion was observed on brain and spine MRI and an electromyography study showed no evidence of peripheral nerve injury or radiculopathy. At 6 months after onset, the central pain in the left hand and foot became aggravated, with a Visual Analogue Scale score of 6. Result(s): On 1-month DTT, partial tearing was observed in both STTs. In contrast, both partially torn STTs had become atrophy on 9-month DTT. Conclusion(s): This study recommends further studies conducted on the prognosis (regeneration or degeneration) of injured STTs and on the effect of change of an injured STT on central pain.Copyright © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Rationale and Objectives The aims of this study were to propose a semiautomated technique to segment and measure the volume of different nerve components of the tibial nerve, such as the nerve fascicles and the epineurium, based on magnetic resonance microneurography and a segmentation tool derived from brain imaging; and to assess the reliability of this method by measuring interobserver and intraobserver agreement. Materials and Methods The tibial nerve of 20 healthy volunteers (age range = 23-69; mean = 47; standard deviation = 15) was investigated at the ankle level. High-resolution images were obtained through tailored microneurographic sequences, covering 28 mm of nerve length. Two operators manually segmented the nerve using the in-phase image. This region of interest was used to mask the nerve in the water image, and two-class segmentation was performed to measure the fascicular volume, epineurial volume, nerve volume, and fascicular to nerve volume ratio (FNR). Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were calculated. Results The nerve structure was clearly visualized with distinction of the fascicles and the epineurium. Segmentation provided absolute volumes for nerve volume, fascicular volume, and epineurial volume. The mean FNR resulted in 0.69 with a standard deviation of 0.04 and appeared to be not correlated with age and sex. Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were excellent with alpha values >0.9 for each parameter investigated, with measurements free of systematic errors at the Bland-Altman analysis. Conclusions We concluded that the method is reproducible and the parameter FNR is a novel feature that may help in the diagnosis of neuropathies detecting changes in volume of the fascicles or the epineurium.Copyright © 2016 The Association of University Radiologists

N2  - Purpose To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 measurements in the evaluation of radiation-induced peripheral nerve injury (RIPNI). Materials and Methods RIPNI was produced in a randomly selected side of sciatic nerve in each of 21 rabbits while the contralateral side served as the control. The limb function and MR parameters were evaluated over a 4-month period. Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (lambdaa), radial diffusivity (lambdaa) and T2 values were obtained using 3T MR for quantitative analysis. Two animals were randomly killed for histological evaluation at each timepoint. Results The T2 value of irradiated nerve increased at 1 day (63.95 +/- 15.60, P = 0.012) and was restored at 1 month (52.34 +/- 5.38, P = 0.105). It increased progressively at 2 to 4 months (60.39 +/- 10.60, 66.96 +/- 6.08, 75.51 +/- 7.39, all P < 0.01). lambdaa significantly increased at 1 day (0.82 +/- 0.44, P = 0.046) and slightly decreased at 1 month (0.61 +/- 0.17, P < 0.001). It increased gradually from 2 to 3 months (0.84 +/- 0.29, 1.13 +/- 0.33, both P < 0.001) followed by a decline at 4 months (0.83 +/- 0.17, P < 0.001). FA was statistically lower than the contralateral sides at 1 to 4 months (0.72 +/- 0.08, 0.60 +/- 0.12, 0.51 +/- 0.11, 0.62 +/- 0.06, all P < 0.01). Changes in FA and lambdaa correlated well with the functional and pathological changes in irradiated nerve. Conclusion DTI may be a more sensitive and accurate method to evaluate RIPNI compared with T2 measurements. FA and lambdaa are promising quantitative indices in monitoring RIPNI.Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Neurocutaneous syndromes and brain tumors
A1  - Ullrich, Nicole J. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - The etiology of most childhood cancer remains largely unknown, but is likely attributable to random or induced genetic aberrations in somatic tissue. However, a subset of children develops cancer in the setting of an underlying inheritable condition involving a germline genetic mutation or chromosomal aberration. The term "neurocutaneous syndrome" encompasses a group of multisystem, hereditary disorders that are associated with skin manifestations as well as central and/or peripheral nervous system lesions of variable severity. This review outlines the central nervous system tumors associated with underlying neurocutaneous disorders, including neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, Von Hippel Lindau, and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Recognizing the presence of an underlying syndrome is critically important to both optimizing clinical care and treatment as well as genetic counseling and monitoring of these affected patients and their families.Copyright © SAGE Publications.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the quality of recently emerged advanced diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques with conventional single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) in a functional assessment of lumbar nerve roots. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved the study including 12 healthy volunteers. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed at 3 T (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare) with b-values of 0 and 700 s/mm2 and an isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar reformatting. The nerve roots L2 to S1 were imaged in coronal orientation with readout-segmented EPI (rs-DTI) and selective-excitation EPI (sTX-DTI) with an acquisition time of 5 minutes each, and in axial orientation with single-shot EPI (ss-DTI) with an acquisition time of 12 minutes (scan parameters as in recent literature). Two independent readers qualitatively and quantitatively assessed image quality. Result(s): The interobserver reliability ranged from "substantial" to "almost perfect" for all examined parameter and all 3 sequences (kappa = 0.70-0.94). Overall image quality was rated higher, and artifact levels were scored lower for rs-DTI and sTX-DTI than for ss-DTI (P = 0.007-0.027), while fractional anisotropy and signal-to-noise ratio values were similar for all sequences (P >= 0.306 and P >= 0.100, respectively). Contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly higher for rs-DTI and ss-DTI than for sTX-DTI (P = 0.004-0.013). Conclusion(s): Despite shorter acquisition times, rs-DTI and sTX-DTI produced images of higher quality with smaller geometrical distortions than the current standard of reference, ss-DTI. Thus, DTI acquisitions in the coronal plane, requiring fewer slices for full coverage of exiting nerve roots, may allow for functional neurography in scan times suitable for routine clinical practice.Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Differentiating multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is important, as MMN is a difficult, but treatable disorder. Method(s): We studied peripheral nerve imaging techniques in differentiating MMN from ALS by measuring the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median and ulnar nerves in the forearms using high resolution ultrasound (HRUS) and MRI. Result(s): HRUS CSA values of the median nerve in the forearm (P = 0.002) and the ulnar nerve distal to the sulcus (P = 0.009) were significantly enlarged in patients with MMN. There was a positive correlation between CSA as measured with HRUS and MRI (Spearman rho 0.60; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Peripheral nerve imaging is a potentially powerful technique to distinguish MMN from ALS. Muscle Nerve, 2016 Muscle Nerve 54: 1133-1135, 2016.Copyright © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Wernicke's encephalopathy is often undiagnosed, particularly in non-alcoholics. There are very few reports of non-alcoholic patients diagnosed with Korsakoff syndrome in the absence of a prior diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy and no studies of diffusion tensor imaging in non-alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome. We report on three non-alcoholic psychiatric patients (all women) with long-term non-progressive memory impairment that developed after malnutrition accompanied by at least one of the three Wernicke's encephalopathy manifestations: ocular abnormalities, ataxia or unsteadiness, and an altered mental state or mild memory impairment. In neuropsychological examination, all patients had memory impairment, including intrusions. One patient had mild cerebellar vermis atrophy in MRI taken after the second episode of Wernicke's encephalopathy. The same patient had mild hypometabolism in the lateral cortex of the temporal lobes. Another patient had mild symmetrical atrophy and hypometabolism of the superior frontal lobes. Two patients were examined with diffusion tensor imaging. Reduced fractional anisotropy values were found in the corona radiata in two patients, and the uncinate fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in one patient. Our results suggest that non-alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome is underdiagnosed. Psychiatric patients with long-term memory impairment may have Korsakoff syndrome and, therefore, they should be evaluated for a history of previously undiagnosed Wernicke's encephalopathy.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objective The use of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was evaluated in assessing cochlear nerve deficiency (CND) and its effect on normal maturation of auditory tract. Methods 25 CND patients and 25 controls (age matched: 2 months to 17 years, gender matched) were evaluated by mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis, and radial kurtosis and compared against fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivities in internal auditory canal (IAC), lateral lemniscus (LL) and inferior colliculus (IC). The age related changes of auditory tract were studied through Pearson correlation between estimated indices and age of both CND and control populations. Results Significant loss of MK (IAC: 10.71%, IC: 10.87%, LL: 15.63%) was observed in CND cases as against moderate reduction in FA (IAC: 8.57%, IC: 10%, LL: 7.69%) in all three anatomical locations. Similarly, substantial decline is observed in radial kurtosis (IAC: 27.03%, IC: 33.33%, LL: 31.43%) in comparison to moderate increase in radial diffusivity (IAC: 13.46%, IC: 24.39%, LL: 24%) in CND cases. No statistically significant change was seen in both axial kurtosis and diffusivities. In control populations, MK (r = 0.473, p = 0.011) and radial kurtosis (r = 0.418, p = 0.016) correlate positively with age and had no correlation in case of CND cases. FA (r = 0.356, p = 0.019) minimally correlated with age in control population but showed no statistically significant correlation in CND cases (r = 0.198, p = 0.036). Conclusion DKI metrics performed better than DTI in assessing microstructural changes of CND. In particular, MK and radial kurtosis are found to be more sensitive enough to differentiate the normal maturation of cochlear nerve from CND cases.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - SPG11 belongs to the autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) and presents during childhood or puberty with a complex clinical phenotype encompassing learning difficulties, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, and mental retardation. We hereby present the case of a 30-year-old female patient with complex autosomal recessive HSP with thinning of the corpus callosum (TCC) and dementia that was compound heterozygous with two novel mutations in the SPG11 gene. Sequence analysis of the SPG11 gene revealed two novel mutations in a compound heterozygous state in the index patient (c.2431C>T/p.Gln811Ter and c.6755-6756insT/p.Glu2252Aspfs*88). MRI showed abnormal TCC, white matter (WM) hyperintensities periventricularly, and the 'ears of the lynx' sign. Diffusion tensor imaging showed a mild-to-moderate decrease in fractional anisotropy and an increase in mean diffusivity in WM compared to age-matched controls, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed abnormal findings in affected WM with a decrease in N-acetyl-aspartate in WM regions of interest. This is the first SPG11 kindred from the Greek population to be reported in the medical literature.Copyright © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Paresthesia-dominant and pain-dominant subgroups have been noted in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a peripheral neuropathic disorder characterized by altered primary somatosensory/motor (S1/M1) physiology. We aimed to investigate whether brain morphometry dissociates these subgroups. Subjects with CTS were evaluated with nerve conduction studies, whereas symptom severity ratings were used to allocate subjects into paresthesia-dominant (CTS-paresthesia), pain-dominant (CTS-pain), and pain/paresthesia nondominant (not included in further analysis) subgroups. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at 3T using a multiecho MPRAGE T1-weighted pulse sequence, and gray matter cortical thickness was calculated across the entire brain using validated, automated methods. CTS-paresthesia subjects demonstrated reduced median sensory nerve conduction velocity (P 0.05) compared with CTS-pain subjects. In addition, cortical thickness in precentral and postcentral gyri (S1/M1 hand area) contralateral to the more affected hand was significantly reduced in CTS-paresthesia subgroup compared with CTS-pain subgroup. Moreover, in CTS-paresthesia subjects, precentral cortical thickness was negatively correlated with paresthesia severity (r(34) -0.40, P 0.016) and positively correlated with median nerve sensory velocity (r(36) 0.51, P 0.001), but not with pain severity. Conversely, in CTS-pain subjects, contralesional S1 (r(9) 0.62, P 0.042) and M1 (r(9) 0.61, P 0.046) cortical thickness were correlated with pain severity, but not median nerve velocity or paresthesia severity. This double dissociation in somatotopically specific S1/M1 areas suggests a neuroanatomical substrate for symptom-based CTS subgroups. Such fine-grained subgrouping of CTS may lead to improved personalized therapeutic approaches, based on superior characterization of the linkage between peripheral and central neuroplasticity.Copyright © 2016 International Association for the Study of Pain.

N2  - Purpose: While standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are increasingly employed in post-mortem (PM) examinations, more advanced techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) remain unexplored in forensic sciences. Therefore, we studied the temporal stability and reproducibility of DTI and fiber tractography (FT) in non-fixed PM subjects. In addition, we investigated the lumbosacral nerves with PMDTI and compared their tissue characteristics to in vivo findings. Method(s): MRI data were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner in seven PM subjects, consisting of six non-trauma deaths and one chronic trauma death, and in six living subjects. Inter-scan (within one session) and inter-session (between days) reproducibility of diffusion parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD), were evaluated for the lumbosacral nerves using Bland-Altman and Jones plots. Diffusion parameters in nerves L3-S2 were compared to living subjects using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): Reproducibility of diffusion values of inter-scan 95% limits of agreement ranged from -0.058 to 0.062 for FA, and (-0.037 to 0.052) x 10-3 mm2/s for MD. For the inter-session this was -0.0423 to 0.0423, and (-0.0442 to 0.0442) x 10-3 mm2/s for FA, and MD, respectively. Although PM subjects showed approximately four-fold lower diffusivity values compared to living subjects, FT results were comparable. The chronic trauma case showed disorganization and asymmetry of the nerves. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that DTI was reproducible in characterizing nervous tissue properties and FT in reconstructing the architecture of lumbosacral nerves in PM subjects. We showed differences in diffusion values between PM and in vivo and showed the ability of PMDTI and FT to reconstruct nerve lesions in a chronic trauma case. We expect that PMDTI and FT may become valuable in identification and documentation of PM nerve trauma or pathologies in forensic sciences.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: After successful utilization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting brain pathologies, it is now being examined for use in the detection of peripheral neuropathies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic potentials of DTI in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Material/Methods: The literature search was performed in multiple electronic databases using a keyword search and final selection of the studies was based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We performed a meta-analyses of mean differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between CTS patient and healthy subjects. Publication bias detection was done with Begg's test and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the source/s of higher heterogeneity and the authenticity of results. Result(s): FA was significantly lower in CTS patients in comparison with healthy subjects (mean and the difference [95% confidence interval] was -0.06 [-0.10, -0.02] (p=0.003). The ADC was significantly higher in CTS patients (mean difference [95% CI] was 0.10 [0.02, 0.18], p=0.02). Overall sensitivity of FA-based diagnosis was 82.82%, with 77.83% specificity. Conclusion(s): DTI can be a valuable tool in diagnosing CTS.Copyright © Med Sci Monit, 2016.

N2  - Purpose To determine the reliability and reproducibility of peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in healthy subjects. Materials and Methods We assessed the test-retest and interrater reliability studies of peripheral nerve DTI in a cohort of 12 healthy subjects (mean age 44.0 years, range 26-71 years). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed on a 3T scanner (MR750, GE Healthcare). DTI and T1-weighted sequences were performed on the tibial and peroneal nerves in the knee. Each subject was scanned on three separate occasions. Image analyses were performed at two anatomic positions: the level of the lateral femoral condyle (position 1), and the superior pole of the patella (position 2). Analysis was performed using three software packages ("raters"): FuncTools, FSL, and Diffusion Toolkit. Metrics obtained included fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Results DTI metrics were not significantly different between each measurement position, except peroneal nerve AD and tibial nerve RD were higher at position 1 (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). There was no significant difference in DTI metrics between male and female subjects (P = 0.10-0.99). The test-retest reliability of DTI metrics was high, maximal for FA (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96). ICC values for individual DTI metrics were similar between each measurement position, except that tibial nerve AD was significantly higher at position 2 (P = 0.03). Interrater reliability was also high (ICC = 0.95-0.96). Conclusion We found peripheral nerve DTI to be reliable and reproducible, with few effects related to the postprocessing package used.Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Objectives The aims of this preliminary study were to determine the number of axonal bundles (fascicles) in the median nerve,1 using a high-resolution, proton density (PD)-turbo spin echo (TSE) fat suppression sequence, and to determine normative T2 values, measured by triple-echo steady state, of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), at 7 T.2 Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted between March 2014 and January 2015. All study participants gave written informed consent. Six healthy volunteers (30 +/- 12 years) and 5 patients with CTS (44 +/- 16 years) were included. Measurements were performed on both wrists in all volunteers and on the affected wrist in patients (3 right, 2 left). Based on 5-point scales, 2 readers assessed image quality (1, very poor; 5, very good) and the presence of artifacts that might have a possible influence on fascicle determination (1, severe artifacts; 5, no artifacts) and counted the number of fascicles independently on the PD-TSE sequences. Furthermore, T2 values by region of interest analysis were assessed. Student t tests, a hierarchic linear model, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Proton density-TSE image quality and artifacts revealed a median of 5 in healthy volunteers and 4 in patients with CTS for both readers. Fascicle count of the median nerve ranged from 13 to 23 in all subjects, with an ICC of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.95). T2 values were significantly higher (P = 0.023) in patients (24.27 +/- 0.97 milliseconds [95% CI, 22.19-26.38]) compared with healthy volunteers (21.01 +/- 0.65 milliseconds [95% CI, 19.61-22.41]). The ICC for all T2 values was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98). Conclusion(s): This study shows the possibility of fascicle determination of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and patients with CTS (although probably less accurately) with high-resolution 7 T magnetic resonance imaging, as well as significantly higher T2 values in patients with CTS, which seems to be associated with pathophysiological nerve changes.Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Spinal cord and peripheral nerves are classically known to be damaged in Friedreich's ataxia, but the extent of cerebral involvement in the disease and its progression over time are not yet characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate longitudinally cerebral damage in Friedreich's ataxia Methods: We enrolled 31 patients and 40 controls, which were evaluated at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. To assess gray matter, we employed voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness measurements. White matter was evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging. Statistical analyses were both cross-sectional and longitudinal (corrected for multiple comparisons). Result(s): Group comparison between patients and controls revealed widespread macrostructural differences at baseline: gray matter atrophy in the dentate nuclei, brainstem, and precentral gyri; and white matter atrophy in the cerebellum and superior cerebellar peduncles, brainstem, and periventricular areas. We did not identify any longitudinal volumetric change over time. There were extensive microstructural alterations, including superior cerebellar peduncles, corpus callosum, and pyramidal tracts. Longitudinal analyses identified progressive microstructural abnormalities at the corpus callosum, pyramidal tracts, and superior cerebellar peduncles after 1 year of follow-up. Conclusion(s): Patients with Friedreich's ataxia present more widespread gray and white matter damage than previously reported, including not only infratentorial areas, but also supratentorial structures. Furthermore, patients with Friedreich's ataxia have progressive microstructural abnormalities amenable to detection in a short-term follow-up.Copyright © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

N2  - Constitutional 11q interstitial deletion syndrome presents with congenital anomalies including microcephaly with craniostenosis, minor dysmorphic features, vitreoretinopathy, and renal anomalies. This syndrome is occasionally associated with neuroblastoma (NB) as a life-threatening complication, which is important for clinical care. Although the corresponding locus to NB has been predicted to exist in 11q22-23 by previous deletion studies related to NB, the causative haploinsufficient genes have not yet been identified. We herein reported for the first time the simultaneous coexistence of adrenal NB and abdominal prevertebral ganglioneuroma in a 6-year-old girl with a constitutional hemizygous 11q14.1-23.3 deletion. Of the 11 haploinsufficient genes predicted with an in silico database, we focused on NCAM1 and CADM1 as the genes accountable for NB and ganglioneuroma. The deletion range, especially the 11q22.3 involvement, needs to be determined in 11q deletion cases in order to predict susceptibility to peripheral nerve tumors involving NB and ganglioneuroma.Copyright © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - The goals of this study were (1) to provide accessible and instructive browsing software for sectioned images and a portable document format (PDF) file that includes three-dimensional (3D) models of an entire dog body and (2) to develop techniques for segmentation and 3D modeling that would enable an investigator to perform these tasks without the aid of a computer engineer. To achieve these goals, relatively important or large structures in the sectioned images were outlined to generate segmented images. The sectioned and segmented images were then packaged into browsing software. In this software, structures in the sectioned images are shown in detail and in real color. After 3D models were made from the segmented images, the 3D models were exported into a PDF file. In this format, the 3D models could be manipulated freely. The browsing software and PDF file are available for study by students, for lecture for teachers, and for training for clinicians. These files will be helpful for anatomical study by and clinical training of veterinary students and clinicians. Furthermore, these techniques will be useful for researchers who study two-dimensional images and 3D models. Anat Rec, 299:81-87, 2016.Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the longitudinal relationship between chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms (sx) and brain perfusion changes in patients with breast cancer. Interaction of CIPN-sx perfusion effects with known chemotherapy-associated gray matter density decrease was also assessed to elucidate the relationship between CIPN and previously reported cancer treatment-related brain structural changes. Method(s): Patients with breast cancer treated with (n=24) or without (n=23) chemotherapy underwent clinical examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging at the following three time points: before treatment (baseline), 1 month after treatment completion, and 1 year after the 1-month assessment. CIPN-sx were evaluated with the self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity four-item sensory-specific scale. Perfusion and gray matter density were assessed using voxel-based pulsed arterial spin labeling and morphometric analyses and tested for association with CIPN-sx in the patients who received chemotherapy. Result(s): Patients who received chemotherapy reported significantly increased CIPN-sx from baseline to 1 month, with partial recovery by 1 year (P <.001). CIPN-sx increase from baseline to 1 month was significantly greater for patients who received chemotherapy compared with those who did not (P=-.001). At 1 month, neuroimaging showed that for the group that received chemotherapy, CIPN-sx were positively associated with cerebral perfusion in the right superior frontal gyrus and cingulate gyrus, regions associated with pain processing (P<.001). Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging analysis in the group receiving chemotherapy indicated that CIPN-sx and associated perfusion changes from baseline to 1 month were also positively correlated with gray matter density change (P <.005). Conclusion(s): Peripheral neuropathy symptoms after systemic chemotherapy for breast cancer are associated with changes in cerebral perfusion and gray matter. The specific mechanisms warrant further investigation given the potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.Copyright © 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology. All rights reserved.

N2  - A 25-year-old man developed a growing neck mass, and percutaneous biopsy yielded diagnosis of schwannoma. The patient underwent magnetic resonance (MR) neurography, including diffusion tensor imaging performed with RESOLVE at 3 tesla (Skyra; Siemens, Malvern, PA). Postprocessing and 3-dimensional tractography were performed in DSI studio (dsi-studio.labsolver.org). 1 MR neurography confirmed a mass arising from the right C4 nerve (figure, A). Tractography localized a potential window for surgical approach in the surrounding nerve fibers (figure, B and C). Intraoperative electrophysiologic mapping and microscopy findings (figure, D-F) precisely confirmed the imaging findings. Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography may be valuable in the preoperative workup of peripheral nerve tumors. 2,3Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Background: Peripheral nerves at the elbow region are prone to entrapment neuropathies and injuries. To make accurate assessment, clinicians need stereoscopic display of the nerves to observe them at all angles. Objective(s): To obtain a stereoscopic display of the peripheral nerves at the elbow region based on magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using three post-processing methods of volume rendering (VR), maximum intensity projection (MIP), and fiber tractography, and to evaluate the difference and correlation between them. Subjects and Methods: Twenty-four elbows of 12 healthy young volunteers were assessed by 20 encoding diffusion direction MR DTI scans. Images belonging to a single direction (anterior-posterior direction, perpendicular to the nerve) were subjected to VR and MIP reconstruction. All raw DTI data were transferred to the Siemens MR workstation for fiber tractography post-processing. Imaging qualities of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were evaluated by two observers independently based on a custom evaluation scale. Result(s): Stereoscopic displays of the nerves were obtained in all 24 elbows by VR, MIP, and fiber tractography post-processing methods. The VR/MIP post-processing methods were easier to perform compared to fiber tractography. There was no significant difference among the scores of fiber tracking and VR/MIP reconstruction for single direction. The imaging quality scores of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were significantly correlated based on intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis (ICC ranged 0.709 - 0.901), which suggested that the scores based on fiber tractography and VR/MIP for the same sample were consistent. Inter- and intraobserver agreements were good to excellent. Conclusion(s): Stereoscopic displays of the peripheral nerves at the elbow region can be achieved by using VR, MIP, and fiber tracking post-processing methods based on raw DTI images. VR and MIP reconstruction could be used as preview tools before fiber tracking to determine whether the raw images are satisfactory.Copyright © 2016, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Iranian Society of Radiology.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown that fractional anisotropy (FA) is lower in peripheral nerves in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We examined whether DTI correlates to muscle strength or impairment. MRI of sciatic and tibial nerves was performed on 3T MR-scanner by obtaining T2-and DTI-weighted sequences with fat saturation. On each slice of T2w and DTI the tibial and sciatic nerve were segmented and served for calculation of signal intensity. On DTI images pixel-by-pixel calculation of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was done. Muscle strength at knee and ankle was determined by isokinetic dynamometry and severity of CIDP by Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS). Fourteen CIDP patients treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin were compared to gender and age matched controls. FA-values of tibial and sciatic nerve were lower in CIDP compared to controls [0.34+/-0.07 vs. 0.42+/-0.07 and 0.42+/-0.07 vs. 0.48+/-0.03 (P < 0.0001)] and ADC-values were higher in CIDP vs. controls [1833+/-277 x10-6mm2/s vs. 1648+/-175 x10-6mm2/s and 1648+/-175 x10-6mm2/s vs. 1568+/-83 x10-6mm2/s (P < 0.05)]. T2w-values were lower in sciatic nerve comparing CIDP to controls. In CIDP, FA-values correlated to NIS (r =-0.57, P = 0.03), but not to muscle strength. In sciatic nerves, FA-value distinguishes CIDP from controls with sensitivity and specificity of 92.9%. CIDP patients have altered FA-, ADC-and T2w-values of sciatic and tibial nerves than controls, but were not correlated to muscle strength in CIDP, although FA-values correlated to NIS. FA-values in sciatic nerves seem promising for differentiation between CIDP and controls. Sponsored by Octapharma Pharmaceuticals.

N2  - Objective: Current medicines for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) control not the mechanism but the symptoms. Stem cell therapy has shown regenerative effects on damaged cells from limb ischemia, and some animal stem cells have been also reported to have favorable effects on DPN. Therefore, we explored the effects of human mobilized mononuclear cells (hMNC) in rats with DPN and examined the mechanisms. Method(s): hMNC were isolated and cryopreserved from a healthy volunteer after G-CSF mobilization. Sprague Dawley nude rats were induced to diabetes by streptozotocin injection and then 8 weeks later, 1 x 106 hMNC were transplanted into muscles of unilateral hind limb. Into the contralateral limb, normal saline was injected as a control. Before and at 4 weeks after transplantation, nerve conduction velocities (NCV) and laser-doppler perfusion imaging of both limbs were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining for PGP9.5 in the foot epidermis was performed to measure nerve regeneration. The grafts were monitored using 3T-MRI in vivo, and expression of growth factors with angiogenic and neurotrophic properties such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) were examined in the muscle by RT-PCR. Result(s): The STZ-induced diabetic rats showed decreased NCV and perfusion compared to nondiabetic rats. NCV, PGP9.5 density, and perfusion were improved in the hMNC-transplanted limbs compared to the saline-injected limbs in the diabetic rats. According to MRI imaging, iron-tagged MNC were observed as long as 5 weeks after transplantation, but the grafts didn't seem to exist so long. In the hMNC-transplanted muscle, mRNA expressions of the growth factors were increased compared to those in the salineinjected muscle. Conclusion(s): This study suggested that hMNC had a potential to regenerate the damaged nerves in DPN. Improved blood perfusion and induction of growth factors could be involved in the process.

N2  - With technical advances in MRI hardware and development of faster, higher resolution pulse sequences, MR imaging has been increasingly used to evaluate peripheral nerve pathologies. Available techniques include T2 based MR neurography utilized for detection of morphological changes and diffusion tensor imaging for detection of functional as well as anatomical changes. However, these techniques pose certain challenges. Some of these challenges are inherent to the technique whereas other challenges vary from case to case. Technical challenges include balancing spatial resolution and coverage and management of artifacts. In addition many pathologies can present with similar morphological changes on MR imaging and as such this technique cannot be used in isolation. Although MRI techniques can demonstrate peripheral nerve abnormalities, the accuracy of the technique and its role in the diagnostic pathway remains to be determined for various pathologies. These challenges will be addressed during the presentation.

N2  - Traditionally, diseases of the peripheral nervous system were diagnosed, based on a combination of detailed clinical and electrophysiological measurements, sometimes accompanied by electromyography. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was predominantly included in the diagnostic workup to rule out any underlying mass lesion within or adjacent to a peripheral nerve. After first experimental studies around 25 years ago, MRI has been further developed for peripheral nerve imaging, by increasing the structural resolution and contrast, and was therefore termed "MR-Neurography" (MRN)1, 2. Since that time, MRN has become a valuable tool in the diagnostic assessment of peripheral nerve lesions as it can determine the exact lesion localization, spatial lesion dispersion and lesion extension in-vivo3. T2-weighted (Tw) sequences with fat saturation were found to be most useful for the imaging of peripheral nerves. In these sequences, normal nerve tissue has a relatively similar signal compared to the surrounding muscles, while a marked signal increase can be seen in case of nerve impairment4, 5. The T2w signal increase of nerve tissue is unspecific, and can be found e.g. in entrapment neuropathies, nerve injuries, metabolic, hereditary or inflamatory neuropathies. Nevertheless, it has a high sensitivity and can help to clearly differentiate between demyelination and axonal nerve lesions, and in traumatic nerve injury it can distinguish between axonotmetic and neurotmetic injury. Additional measurement of the nerve caliber has also proven its validity, in that nerve impairment is often associated with an increase of nerve diameter. The development of highresolution MRN is far from being completed, and more and more new sequences emerged over the last years in order to achieve signal quantification, higher sensitivity, and especially higher specificity. One possible sequence is the Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), a method that is based on the direction-dependent diffusion in anisotropic structures, and which is a quantitative estimate of nerve anisotropy6. Further signal quantification can be achieved by calculating the proton spin density and the apparent T2 relaxation time, which requires the recording of the MR signal at different echo times7. Both parameters are known to be in-vivo markers of nerve tissue integrity and they depend on tissue density as well as on the macromolecular composition and the extracellular content of protein and lipid3. Another new method is the Magnetization Transfer (MT) imaging, where the MT Ratio (MTR) is computed, which can enhance the knowledge about the interaction between free water protons and protons that are associated with macromolecules or bound water, and therewith about the macromolecular tissue content8. Usefulness, validity and clinical relavence of MRN in general and of new diagnostic markers in particular will be demonstrated in non-focal (e.g. polyneuropathies) and focal neuropathies (different nerve entrapement syndroms).

T1  - MRI of nerve entrapment and peripheral nerve tumors

N2  - MR imaging is currently the premier method of depicting disorders of the peripheral nervous system. The information obtained with MR imaging may be complementary to the information provided with ultrasound, electromyography and nerve conduction studies in cases of nerve entrapment. Pathology of the peripheral nerves can be detected and characterized with MR imaging by recognizing changes in the morphology and signal intensity of abnormal nerves. MR imaging can also depict the changes that occur in muscles related to denervation. Entrapment of a peripheral nerve causes signal alteration within the muscles innervated by that nerve on MR images. These signal abnormalities seen with MR imaging may then be followed to resolution or progressive atrophy and fatty infiltration. Moreover, the site and cause of entrapment may be discovered with MR imaging by following the nerve implicated from the distribution of abnormal muscles on MR imaging. These features of MR imaging may help establish the cause of pain and dysfunction related to pathology of the peripheral nervous system. For routine imaging of peripheral nerves on high field systems we use high-resolution fast-spin-echo proton density images (TR 3000/ TE 35) coupled with matching fat-suppressed fast-spin-echo T2- weighted images (TR 4000/TE 50) at the same slice locations in all three planes of section. We also use this method routinely when evaluating joints for internal derangement. Entrapment neuropathies and injuries of peripheral nerves: Morphologic findings on MR imaging in cases of peripheral nerve injury include discontinuity of the nerve and a lax "coiled spring" appearance in cases of nerve transection. An amputation neuroma is characterized by enlargement of the transected nerve at its termination. A peripheral nerve may be visibly compressed or flattened on MR imaging at a site of entrapment or nerve subluxation. Enlargement of a peripheral nerve may be seen proximal or distal to a site of compression. Increased signal on T2-weighted images is the initial MR imaging finding within muscles that are undergoing denervation. Although this increase in relative signal intensity has been reported as early as 24 h after a severe nerve injury, it is typically seen after two to three weeks of denervation on STIR or fat-suppressed T2-weighted images. There is typically perifascial edema present in muscle strain injury that is absent in subacute denervation that allows differentiation of these two entities on MR imaging. In subacute denervation the affected muscles are relatively bright on T2-weighted images secondary to muscle fiber shrinkage and associated increases in extracellular water. These changes may be followed to resolution or may be followed to progressive atrophy and fatty infiltration. The distribution of abnormal muscles on MR imaging may lead to a deduction about the specific nerve that is injured and prompt a careful search along the course of that nerve for a mass. The brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus: Primary abnormalities of the plexus are less common than spinal disorders. We most commonly image the brachial plexus or lumbosacral plexus after an unrevealing MR study of the cervical spine or lumbar spine. The brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus are best imaged, like the spine and joints, with specialized phased array surface coils. These studies require good technique to achieve homogeneous fat suppression and adequate resolution. Despite a more complex wiring diagram compared with the spine and extremities, pathology of the plexus is just as well seen with MR imaging. Commonly encountered entities in both regions include entrapment related to tumors, hematomas, aneurysms, abscesses, and adenopathy as well as dysfunction related to neuritis and radiation therapy. Trauma is more frequent in the brachial plexus relative to the lumbar plexus and sacral plexus. Nerve root avulsions in the cervical spine are associated with a dural tear and traumatic pseudomeningocele that can be seen with MR imaging. Myelography with computed tomography of the cervical spine may provide complementary information in these cases. MR imaging of the sacral plexus and the sciatic nerve can reveal pathoanatomic changes in patients that present with pyriformis syndrome. The upper extremity: MR imaging can be used to evaluate upper extremity nerves after blunt or penetrating trauma. MR imaging is also commonly performed to exclude a mass along the course of a given nerve in patients with a specific neuropathy. In the shoulder, we commonly find unsuspected entrapment of the suprascapular nerve secondary to a paralabral cyst associated with a superior labral tear. Entrapment of the axillary nerve within the quadrilateral space from a paralabral cyst associated with an inferior labral tear may also be seen, but is much less common. In the elbow, we commonly see increased signal within the ulnar nerve in patients with cubital tunnel syndrome. Spurs that undermine the cubital tunnel as well as an anomalous anconeous epitrochlearis muscle superficial to the ulnar nerve are well seen with MR imaging. Subluxation of the ulnar nerve may be seen on scans performed in flexion in patients with an absent or insufficient cubital tunnel retinaculum. We occasionally see entrapment of the deep and superficial branches of the radial nerve in patients with enlargement of the bicipital radial bursa that may present as a painful antecubital fossa mass or may be clinically occult. Entrapment of the median nerve from enlargement of the interosseous bursa is much less commonly encountered. In the wrist, we commonly see increased signal within the median nerve in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. Entrapment of the ulnar nerve in Guyon's canal is less commonly encountered. We commonly find unsuspected entrapment of the posterior interosseous nerve secondary to a dorsal carpal ganglion. Although these cysts may be quite small and clinically occult, they routinely arise from the dorsal fibers of the scapholunate ligament near the junction of the lunate, scaphoid, and capitate bones and are well seen on MR imaging if the scan is examined carefully in this region. These cysts arise just deep to the radial aspect of the fourth extensor tendon compartment where the posterior interosseous nerve is receiving the sensory fibers of the wrist joint. MR imaging may demonstrate an associated small defect of the scapholunate ligament in patients with these dorsal ganglion cysts. The lower extremity: As in the upper extremity, MR imaging is commonly performed to exclude a mass along the course of a given nerve in patients with a specific neuropathy. MR imaging can also be used to evaluate lower extremity nerves after penetrating or blunt trauma. We have seen neuromas related to iatrogenic injury of the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve from knee arthroscopy as well as neuromas related to iatrogenic injury of the deep peroneal nerve from ankle arthroscopy. We have also diagnosed a neuroma of the lateral calcaneal branch of the sural nerve related to repair of the Achilles tendon as well as a neuroma of the superficial peroneal nerve related to a fascial release for compartment syndrome. We have also seen nerve injury related to deep lacerations and fractures in the lower extremity with MR imaging. In the hip, it is relatively uncommon to encounter entrapment neuropathies with MR imaging. Enlargement of the iliopsoas bursa may be associated with hip arthropathies and can cause entrapment of the femoral nerve that can be detected with MR imaging. Rupture of the proximal hamstring tendons or muscles can result in a hematoma that entraps the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve may also be injured in posterior dislocation of the hip. We have seen several cases of obturator nerve entrapment by masses such as paralabral csyts resulting in adductor compartment muscle denervation on MR imaging. In the knee, we occasionally see entrapment of the peroneal nerve secondary to ganglion cysts that communicate with the proximal tibiofibular joint. These ganglion cysts may dissect along the course of small articular nerve branches to enter the nerve sheath and entrap the nerve fibers from within the sheath. Such intraneural ganglion cysts may occur near other joints but most commonly involve the common peroneal nerve. Intraneural ganglion cysts may rarely involve the tibial nerve and communicate with the knee. Amputation stump neuromas are well seen with MR imaging and are most commonly seen about the knee. In the ankle, we occasionally see entrapment of the tibial nerve in patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome. Common etiologies seen on MR imaging include talocalcaneal coalition that may undermine the tarsal tunnel and ganglion cysts that arise from the medial aspect of the ankle joint, subtalar joint or flexor tendon sheaths. Ganglion cysts and coalition may coexist and contribute to entrapment of the tibial nerve within the tarsal tunnel. Morton's neuromas are also well seen with MR imaging and are commonly found between the metatarsal heads in patients with forefoot pain. Most Morton's neuromas are decreased in signal on T2- weighted images, with increased signal seen in about 25% of cases on MR imaging. The increased signal may be related to intraneural edema and ischemia in relatively acute cases. Morton's neuromas may be detected with MR imaging in patients that are asymptomatic. This is not surprising given the existing body of literature that has determined the prevalence of various disorders such as spinal stenosis, disc protrusions, labral tears, and meniscal tears in elderly, relatively asymptomatic patients with MR imaging. Neoplasms of peripheral nerves: Any type of mass may compress a peripheral nerve and cause symptoms related to pain and dysfunction. In this section, we will briefly consider MR imaging of intrinsic masses of peripheral nerves.

N2  - Objective: To describe clinical and genetic features of the third patient with mutations in COASY, a rare form of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). Background(s): NBIA is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized radiologically by iron deposition in the globus pallidus and occasionally in other basal ganglionic structures. Multiple causative genes have been identified, but approximately 30% of cases remain unexplained. In 2014, biallelic mutations in COASY, the gene coding for CoA synthase, were reported in two patients with early childhood toe-walking, intellectual disability, progressive dystonia, and motor axonal neuropathy; these are the only cases reported to date (Dusi et al 2014). CoA synthase is involved in the last two steps of Coenzyme A biosynthesis. Another defect in Coenzyme A synthesis underlies the most common form of NBIA, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), which is caused by mutations in PANK2. Case: Our male patient was born to consanguineous parents of Italian origin. Birth history and infantile development were reportedly normal. He walked at 16 months, but at 18 months he was referred for neurological evaluation due to deceleration in head growth, hypotonia, abnormal gait, and marked speech and language delay. At 6 years he was able to walk with supervision, however his motor function then deteriorated. He developed left arm dystonia and then progressive generalized dystonia over the next 3 years. Examination at 10 years revealed inability to walk, truncal hypotonia, lower limb spasticity, hyperreflexia, weakness, and generalized dystonia with marked involvement of the left arm and leg. Speech articulation became increasingly impaired. Trihexylphenidyl and clonazepam provided limited symptomatic benefit. Brain MRI at 12 years demonstrated symmetric abnormal pallidal susceptibility, consistent with iron deposition. There was T2 hyperintensity within the anteromedial region, and a small, round area of T1 hypointensity in the center of the globus pallidus bilaterally. No mutations in PANK2, FLT, or C19ORF12 were detected. Analysis of the COASY gene revealed the homozygous missense variant c.1222G>A (p.Glu408Lys), predicted to be pathogenic. Conclusion(s): The NBIA syndrome associated with mutations in COASY is characterized clinically by spasticity and toe-walking in early childhood, intellectual disability, and slowly progressive generalized dystonia. The pallidal lesions seen on MRI are distinctive, and can be differentiated from similar lesions observed in PKAN.

T1  - Disruption of white matter integrity in sensory and motor pathways in diabetic peripheral neuropathy: Evidence from diffusion tensor imaging

N2  - Background and aims: There is now emerging evidence that diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is associated with both structural change and functional reorganization of the somatosensory cortex (SSC). We have previously demonstrated spinal cord atrophy and a reduction in grey matter volume in the primary SSC in DSPN but the integrity of the white matter tracks between these two anatomical areas has not been studied. In this study we have applied Magnetic Resonance (MR) Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to estimate cerebral water diffusion directionality which can be used to infer intracranial axonal tract architecture. Material(s) and Method(s): 11 type 1 diabetes patients (8 males, mean age 54.6+13.8 years) with DPN and 13 healthy volunteers (7 males, age 49.3+15.0 years) without diabetes underwent detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments (NIS-LL+7 - confirming DPN). All subjects had DTI on MR at 3T (Achieva, Philips Healthcare) using a spin-echo, EPI-based 32-direction technique. Group mean fractional anisotropy maps were generated and compared. Result(s): We found significantly lower fractional anisotropy in the primary SSC (MNI coordinates: -32,-30,46), supramarginal gyrus (-28,-40,39) and corticospinal tract (-24,-17,36) in DSPN compared to the healthy volunteer group (p < 0.05). There were no regions where the fractional anisotropy was higher in the DPN compared to healthy volunteer group. Conclusion(s): This study for the first time has shown alterations in white matter water diffusion fractional anisotropy in patients with DPN. This finding implies disruption of white matter tract integrity of the sensory and motor pathways in the brain in DPN. Changes in the degree of white matter structure, as indexed by a decline in fractional anisotropy, might provide a bio-mechanical understanding of CNS involvement in DPN. Larger studies are now required with including a diabetic control group without DPN.

N2  - Background and aims: Current medicines for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) control not the mechanism but the symptoms. Stem cell therapy has shown regenerative effects on damaged cells from limb ischemia, and some animal stem cells have been also reported to have favorable effects on DPN. Therefore, we explored the effects of human mobilized mononuclear cells (hMNC) in rats with DPN and examined the mechanisms. Material(s) and Method(s): hMNC were isolated and cryopreserved from a healthy volunteer after G-CSF mobilization. Sprague Dawley nude rats were induced to diabetes (DM) by streptozotocin injection and then 8 weeks later, 1 x 106 hMNC were transplanted into muscles of Rt. hind limb. Into the contralateral Lt. limb, normal saline was injected as a control. Before and at 4 weeks after transplantation, nerve conduction velocities (NCV) and laser-doppler perfusion imaging of both limbs were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining for PGP9.5 in the foot epidermis was performed to measure nerve regeneration. Expression of growth factors with angiogenic and neurotrophic properties were examined in the muscle by RT-PCR, and the grafts were monitored using 3T-MRI in vivo. Immortalized mouse Schwann cell line, IMS32 cells were cultured to examine effects of growth factors on myelination markers. Result(s): The DMrats showed decreased NCVand perfusion compared to non-DM rats. NCV and perfusion improved in the hMNC-transplanted limbs compared to the saline-injected limbs in the DM rats. However, density of intra-epidermal nerve fibers was not significantly different between the limbs. According to MRI imaging, iron-tagged hMNC were observed as long as 5 weeks after transplantation, but the grafts didn't exist so long. mRNA expression of HGF in the hMNC treated muscle increased compared to that in the saline-injected muscle, and HGF treatment significantly enhanced Mpz transcript in IMS32 cells. Conclusion(s): This study suggested that hMNC had a potential to improve DPN, and improved blood perfusion and induction of growth factors could be involved in the process.

N2  - Introduction: A major diagnostic challenge in treating traumatic peripheral nerve injuries is to distinguish axonotmetic from neurotmetic grades of injury, since the former can recover on their own while the latter require a surgical intervention and repair. Current treatment protocols mandate performing serial clinical exams and electrodiagnostic studies to look for evidence of functional recovery and muscle reinnervation respectively. MR neurography using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocols is showing promise in visualizing axons both in normal and injured nerves showing axonal degeneration and regeneration. We are studying various ultrasound protocols to determine whether this less expensive and more available imaging modality can also be used to distinguish axonotmetic from neurotmetic grades of nerve injury. Method(s): Patients with severe traumatic peripheral nerve injuries producing complete axonal degeneration were evaluated with serial clinical exams, electrodiagnostic studies, MR neurography, and ultrasound studies using both standard and eleastography protocols. Ultrasound imaging was performed with the focus on looking at differences in nerve containing axons, severely damaged nerve not containing axons following axonal degeneration, and repaired nerve containing regenerating axons. Ultrasound findings were correlated with evidence of recovery as shown by functional improvement on clinical exam, muscle reinnervation on EMG studies, and findings on MR DTI studies. Result(s): Our preliminary findings show that ultrasound imaging can detect differences in nerve with and without axons. Specifically, distal damaged nerve following degeneration of axons shows evidence of increased stiffness as compared to more normal nerve with axons proximal to the site of traumatic injury. Conclusion(s): Ultrasound using both standard and elastography protocols shows promise in distinguishing severe nerve injuries that can recover through axonal regeneration (axontometic grade) from the more severe types of injury (neurotmetic grade) that cannot recover without a surgical intervention and repair.

N2  - Background and aims: Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is a devastating autosomal dominantly inherited disorder with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) as one of its main features. We systematically studied FAP using a high-resolution ultrasonography (US). Method(s): In this prospective cross-sectional study we took structured patients' history, performed neurological examination, and measured peripheral nerve cross sectional areas (CSAs) using US. Nerve CSAs were bilaterally measured at 14 standard locations. Demographic and US findings were compared to unilateral findings obtained in 50 healthy volunteers. Result(s): Study included 33 FAP patients and 21 asymptomatic TTR gene mutation carriers. Patients' peripheral nerve CSAs were significantly larger than controls', most dramatically at the common entrapment sites (e.g., median nerve at the wrist and ulnar nerve at the elbow), and in the proximal nerve segments (e.g., median nerve in the upper arm; Fig. 1). Findings in carriers were similar but less pronounced, with CSAs being significantly larger compared to the control group only in the median nerve at the upper arm. Conclusion(s): We confirmed peripheral nerve thickening in FAP patients, which is probably caused by amyloid accumulation with resulting nerve oedema and fibrosis. As previously demonstrated in patho-histological and magnetic resonance neurography studies nerve thickenings were most pronounced in the proximal nerve segments. Similar findings in diabetic symmetric distal and vasculitic polyneuropathies were attributed to the ischaemic nerve damage at the watershed zones of poor perfusion, such as in the mid-upper arm or the mid-thigh. Our data therefore support microvascular impairment in the pathogenesis of FAP. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with severe morbidity and mortality, and SCI may lead to reduced life expectancy. The most prevalent cause of SCI is traffic accidents and falls, both inflicting contusion traumas. While humans are incapable of restoring affected neural tissue after SCI, some vertebrates have the ability to regenerate neural tissue. One of these species is the Mexican axolotl salamander (Ambystoma mexicanum). Previous studies have shown that spinal cord resection in the axolotl resulted in complete regeneration with ependymal cells being the apparent progenitor. Contusion trauma in mice results in rapid and comprehensive activation of reactive ependymal cells, but without encourage of regeneration. However, in vitro experiments have shown that ependymal cells possess potential to differentiate into either astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Several mammalian studies have shown regenerative potential of the central nervous system (CNS) under specific circumstances, e.g. when grafting tissue from peripheral nerves to CNS lesions. Some nervous restoration can be achieved by introducing the permissive environment of the peripheral nerve system. The regenerative potential of the axolotl after resection and previous experiments on mammals strongly indicate that the paradigm of CNS not being able to regenerate is trembling. The aim of this study was to investigate the axolotl's ability to regenerate after contusion spinal cord injury. Methods This study is on-going (at the time of abstract submission) as a single blinded investigation. Axolotls were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 6) or the sham group (n = 6). A laminectomy of two vertebrae at the level just caudal to the hind limbs was performed. To induce a blunt SCI, a 25 g rod in 30 mm free fall was released on the exposed spinal cord of animals of the intervention group. Sham received identical surgery without SCI. To examine regrowth, multiple modalities were applied pre-operatively, and subsequently every third week for 9 weeks. T2-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging MRI sequences were applied to reveal regeneration of the spinal cord and estimate the degree of linear diffusion at the site of injury. To support non-invasive anatomical examinations, the progress of spinal cord regeneration was assessed by histology. Functional regeneration was tested using swimming exercise yielding the maximal swimming capacity of the animals during the regenerative process. Finally, activity level was monitored by computationally tracking animal movements during a 1-hour period. Results and discussion We found full anatomical and functional recovery after traumatic SCI within 2 months. Whilst still being in progress, the experiment has produced results at the first time point. DTI and following functional anisotropy analysis were successfully used to visualise the injury, with apparent differences between intervention and sham groups. The swimming capacity test has also shown that sham animals scored higher than intervention animals. The perspective of the study is to apply the model in future studies on neurogenic and regenerative factors on a molecular level. (Figure presented).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a rare childhood onset autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the central and peripheral nervous system. Mutations in the GAN gene cause loss of function of gigaxonin, a cytoskeletal regulatory protein, clinically leading to progressive sensorimotor neuropathy and neuropathy, reduced coordination, slurred speech, seizures, and progressive respiratory failure leading to death by the 2nd to 3rd decade of life. We are in the midst of a first-in-human intrathecal AAV9 mediated gene transfer trial for GAN. Given the ultra-rare nature of the disease, it is critical to build disease appropriate outcome measures and have lead in safety and outcome data to feed into the clinical trial. Our aim here was to identify and develop targeted quantitative markers of disease severity in GAN. METHOD(S): This natural history study evaluated measures of motor, neurophysiologic, and ophthalmologic function as well as exploratory neuroimaging markers in genetically confirmed GAN patients seen at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The primary aim was to correlate a quantitative motor scale (MFM32) with a semi-quantitative Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) in cross sectional analysis of GAN patients. Secondary aims included evaluation of strength (myometry) and motor nerve amplitude (nerve conduction) compared to motor function (MFM32). Quantitative ophthalmologic testing included retinal nerve fiber layer thickness analysis correlated to visual acuity, MFM32, and motor nerve amplitude. Additional exploratory measures of spinal cord volume, brain DTI, quantitative MR spectroscopy, and biochemical (in serum and CSF) measures are underway. RESULT(S): 15 GAN patients were evaluated at the NIH. Data analysis (Pearson correlation) showed the following: 1) NIS and MFM32 are significantly correlated (p<0.0001); 2) Muscle strength of knee extension, knee flexion, hip abduction, and hand grip each correlate significantly with MFM32 (p values from <0.0001 to 0.039) ; 3) Median motor nerve amplitude correlates significantly with MFM32 (p=0.0016). There was no significant correlation between elbow extension or elbow flexion strength and MFM32. Retinal nerve fiber layer corresponds strongly with MFM32 and the median motor nerve amplitude (p<0.0001 and p=0.005, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): The phase I intrathecal gene transfer study for GAN is a novel clinical trial, and will set a precedent by proof of principle for future gene transfer trials for neurodegenerative disorders. The primary outcome is safety, but given that the trial entails administration of a presumed effective dose, careful selection to outcome measures was essential in the protocol design. Through this natural history study, we have identified markers such as the MFM32, NIS, median motor amplitude, and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, as well as spinal cord volumetric data that clearly correlate with disease progression. These markers are being followed longitudinally in natural history and were designed into the phase I trial. Such broad data capture allows for the incorporation of more targeted disease specific clinically meaningful outcome measures and data on natural rate of progression of such markers over short durations of follow up. Such models of trial design will be crucial to the development of genetic therapeutic trials for rare neurodegenerative disorders.

N2  - Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD), or Krabbe disease, results from a deficiency in the hydrolytic enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC), which is responsible for degrading the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS) myelin lipids galactosylceramide and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). Symptoms in infants include irritability and stiffness with disease progressing rapidly to a vegetative state and death typically resulting by 2 years of age. GLD is naturally occurring in dogs and signs include ataxia, tremors, pelvic limb paralysis, loss of hearing, and blindness, with disease progression warranting euthanasia at 15.9 +/- 4.6 weeks. In GLD dogs, GALC concentrations are decreased in leukocytes, CSF, and tissues and psychosine concentrations are elevated in serum and CSF. Conduction velocities in peripheral nerves of GLD dogs are < 50% of normal and G-ratios of the sciatic nerve are significantly higher than normal. Brain stem auditory evoked response testing exhibits a loss of waveform integrity and increased central conduction time consistent with auditory system demyelination. MRI of the brain shows T2-weighted hyperintensity of the white matter, widened sulci, and enlarged ventricles and MRS identified decreases in N-acetylaspartate and increases in choline. Diffusion tensor imaging established decreased fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in multiple white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and posterior internal capsule. Histologically, GLD dogs revealed severe loss of myelin, a decrease in oligodendrocytes, astrogliosis, and microgliosis. Combination gene therapy has been evaluated in GLD affected dogs using AAVrh10 encoding canine GALC (AAVrh10-cGALC). Two GLD dogs received a low dose of AAVrh10-cGALC, 1.2E12, by combination intravenous (IV) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection routes and displayed a modest increase in survival to 17.9 and 22.1 weeks of age. Two additional GLD dogs were treated with an increased dose of AAVrh10-cGALC, 1.9E13, and survival was further increased to 30.3 and 43.1 weeks of age. Both low and high dose combination IV and ICV therapy delayed the onset of neurological signs and prevented the onset of tremors, one of the debilitating neurologic signs in untreated GLD dogs. High dose AAVrh10-cGALC, but not low dose, resulted in complete normalization of pelvic and thoracic limb NCV and near normal sensory NCV. Combination therapy of either dose had negligible effect on the auditory system, as treated animals showed little to no improvement in distance between waveform peaks or hearing threshold over untreated animals. After high dose treatment with AAVrh10-cGALC, GALC activity reached near normal levels in the cerebellum and sciatic nerve, with levels decreasing in more distal brain regions. GALC levels in the liver and heart were intermediate between affected untreated GLD and normal control dogs. Interestingly, the highest GALC activity was found in the quadriceps muscle. GLD dogs treated with high dose AAV had CSF psychosine concentrations lower than untreated and low dose AAVtreated GLD dogs, despite being substantially older. Efficacy of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) alone and in combination with IV AAVrh10-cGALC is currently being evaluated in GLD dogs. Ongoing studies suggest that addition of IV infusion of AAVrh10- cGALC substantially increases survival as compared to HSCT alone.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate if the MRI technique diffusion tensor imaging can detect nerve lesions in Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) patients treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) Background: CIDP is diagnosed based on neurophysiological and clinical examination. Studies have shown that MRI of peripheral nerves can detect lesion in several types of polyneuropathy. Previously, it has been shown that Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is decreased in the tibial nerve from a mixed group of CIDP patients. Method(s): MRI of the sciatic and tibial nerves was performed at thigh and shin using the knee coil on a 3T Siemens Magnetom Skyra MR-scanner. At both thigh and shin one cross section was selected for imaging. Twenty slices were obtained (slice thickness/distance 4:2 mm) performing T2- and DTI-weighted MRI sequences with fat saturation. Data from DTI-weighted images served for pixel-by-pixel calculation of FA and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC). Circular region-of-interest (ROI) was segmented around the tibial and sciatic nerves at each image slice with reference to the T2-weighted images. Average FA- and ADC-values were calculated from the nerve ROI. Result(s): All CIDP patients (n=14) were treated with SCIG (Gammanorm). Healthy controls (n=14) were gender and age matched. FA-values of the tibial and the sciatic nerve were decreased in CIDP versus controls (0.34+/-0.07 vs 0.42+/-0.07 (P<0.0001) and 0.42+/-0.07 vs 0.48+/-0.03 (P<0.0001)). Correspondingly, ADC-values in tibial and sciatic nerve were increased in CIDP versus control (1833+/-277 vs 1648+/-175 (P<0.0001) and (1648+/-175 vs 1568+/-83 (P<0.05)). The sciatic/tibial ratio of the FA-map showed no difference comparing CIDP and controls (1.25+/-0.24 vs 1.16+/-0.15 (P=0.09)) but significant changes were found for the ADC-map (0.91+/-0.13 vs 0.98+/-0.10 (P=0.02)) Conclusion(s): We found decreased FA- and increased ADC-values on DTI of sciatic and tibial nerves in CIDP versus controls suggesting that in CIDP demyelination can be detected by MRI.

N2  - Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD), including the infantile phenotype Krabbe disease, results from a deficiency in the hydrolytic enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC), which is responsible for degrading the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS) myelin lipids galactosylceramide and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). Symptoms in infants include irritability and stiffness with disease progressing rapidly to a vegetative state and death in early childhood. Signs in terrier dogs include ataxia and spastic paralysis with disease progression warranting euthanasia at 16.2 +/- 4.5 weeks. Serum GALC concentrations in both children and dogs are decreased and psychosine concentrations are elevated. Conduction velocities in peripheral nerves of GLD dogs were < 50% of normal and G-ratios of the sciatic nerve were significantly higher than normal. Brain stem auditory evoked response testing exhibited a loss of waveform integrity and increased central conduction time consistent with auditory systemdemyelination. MRI of the brain showed T2-weighted hyperintensity of the white matter, widened sulci, and enlarged ventricles and MRS identified decreases in Nacetylaspartate and increases in choline, indicative of neuronal loss and abnormal myelin turnover respectively. Diffusion tensor imaging established decreased fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in multiplewhitematter tracts including the corpus callosum and posterior internal capsule. Histologically, GLD dogs revealed severe loss of myelin, a decrease in oligodendrocytes, astrogliosis, and microgliosis. Efficacy of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) alone and in combination with intravenous adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy is currently being evaluated in GLD dogs. Preliminary data suggests that addition of IV infusion of AAV substantially increases survival as compared to HSCT alone. Additionally, IV infusion of AAV in combination with CNS-directed delivery is being evaluated in GLD dogs in the absence of HSCT. Preliminary data demonstrates a clear dose response to the therapy, ability to prolong survival, and systemic delivery has shown a positive affect on treating PNS disease.

N2  - Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that occur commonly in individuals with neurocutaneous disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1. Vagal nerve neurofibromas, however, are a relatively rare occurrence.We present the case of a 22-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with a neurofibroma of the left cervical vagal nerve. The mass was resected through an anterior approach without major event. In the postoperative course, the patient developed left vocal cord paralysis treated with medialization with injectable gel. We then present a comprehensive review of the literature for surgical resection of vagal nerve neurofibromas.Copyright © 2016 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the clinical setting as a complementary tool to conventional MRI in the study and assessment of the sciatic nerve and its pathologies. Method(s): 17 patients diagnosed with different types of sciatic neuropathy and 10 healthy controls underwent a conventional MRI and a DTI study in a 3-T MR scanner (Achieva 3-T X-Series; Philips Healthcare, Netherlands). Result(s): In the control group, we were able to track and visualize the common sciatic nerve and its main branches from hip to foot. In the patient group, the affected sciatic nerves presented statistically significant lower fractional anisotropy values and higher apparent diffusion coefficient values when compared with controls, suggesting nerve damage. In all cases, DTI offered complementary information for diagnosis and/or confirmation of the suspected pathology. When compared with conventional MRI, DTI showed higher sensitivity for nerve damage detection. Conclusion(s): DTI offers a significant improvement and an important complement to visualize the sciatic nerve and its main branches. In patients with sciatic nerve pathology DTI allows to a better detection and characterization of the nerve damage.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

N2  - Background The PMP22 gene encodes a protein integral to peripheral myelin. Its deletion leads to hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). PMP22 is not expressed in the adult central nervous system, but previous studies suggest a role in CNS myelin development. The objective of this study was to identify potential structural and functional alterations in the afferent visual system in HNPP patients. Methods Twenty HNPP patients and 18 matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited in a crosssectional study. Participants underwent neurological examination including visual acuity, visual evoked potential (VEP) examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and magnetic resonance imaging with calculation of brain atrophy, regarding grey and white matter, and voxel based morphometry (VBM), in addition answered the National Eye Institute's 39-item Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ). Thirteen patients and 6 HC were additionally examined with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Results All patients had normal visual acuity, but reported reduced peripheral vision in comparison to HC in the NEI-VFQ (p = 0.036). VEP latency was prolonged in patients (P100 = 103.7+/-5.7 ms) in comparison to healthy subjects (P100 = 99.7+/-4.2 ms, p = 0.007). In OCT, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness RNFL was decreased in the nasal sector (90.0+/-15.5 vs. 101.8+/-16.5, p = 0.013), and lower nasal sector RNFL correlated with prolonged VEP latency (Rho = -0.405, p = 0.012). MRS revealed reduced tNAA (731.4+/-45.4 vs. 814.9 +/-62.1, p = 0.017) and tCr (373.8+/-22.2 vs. 418.7+/-31.1, p = 0.002) in the visual cortex in patients vs. HC. Whole brain volume, grey and white matter volume, VBM and metabolites in a MRS sensory cortex control voxel did not differ significantly between patients and HC. Conclusion PMP22 deletion leads to functional, metabolic and macro-structural alterations in the afferent visual system of HNPP patients. Our data suggest a functional relevance of these changes for peripheral vision, which warrants further investigation and confirmation.Copyright © 2016 Brandt et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

N2  - To investigate the microstructural changes in compressed nerves using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of herniated disc treated with percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy. Diffusion tensor imaging has been widely used to visualize peripheral nerves, and the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed using DTI. However, the microstructural changes after surgery are not well-understood in patients with lumbar disc herniation. Thirty-four consecutive patients with foraminal disc herniation affecting unilateral sacral 1 (S1) nerve roots were enrolled in this study. DTI with tractography was performed on S1 nerve roots before and after surgery. The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient values were calculated from tractography images. In compressed nerve roots, the FA value before surgery was significantly lower than that after surgery (P=0.000). A significant difference in FA values was found between the compressed and normal sides before surgery (P=0.000). However, no significant difference was found between the compressed and normal sides after surgery (P=0.057). A significant difference in apparent diffusion coefficient values was found before and after surgery at the compressed side (P=0.023). However, no significant difference was found between the compressed and normal sides after surgery (P=0.203). We show that the diffusion parameters of compressed nerve roots were not significantly different before and after percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy, indicating that the microstructure of the nerve root recovered after surgery.Copyright © 2016 the Author(s).

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Krabbe's disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder resulting from deficiency of beta-galactocerebrosidase that affects primarily cerebral white matter and peripheral nerves. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to changes in white matter myelination, but its assessment is based purely on qualitative, visual inspection, and it is subject to interobserver variability and open to reader bias. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced MRI technique that provides quantitative information about the microscopic structural organization of the white matter and changes in cell density and myelination, and it is a suitable MRI tool for studying Krabbe's disease. This Review discusses the available studies on the application of quantitative DTI analysis to assess white matter changes in patients with Krabbe's disease. Quantitative analysis of DTI scalars, especially radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, has been shown to be a sensitive in vivo biomarker of white matter microstructural damage in Krabbe's disease, to detect early white matter injury in asymptomatic neonates with Krabbe's disease, to predict motor and cognitive functions after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and to serve as a measurement for monitoring effects of HSCT on white matter development in Krabbe's disease. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can provide structural information and objective values for nerves. The aims of this study were to perform quantitative evaluation and fibre tracking of the normal inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) using DTI on 3.0-T MRI., METHODS: DTI was applied to 92 IANs of 46 healthy volunteers. Circular regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on three different positions at the mandibular foramen, second molar and mental foramen of each nerve on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and the ADC and FA of each ROI were measured. Differences in the values arising from the nerve positions were evaluated. Furthermore, fibre tracking of the IANs was performed by tractography, and the quality of visualization was evaluated., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the ADC and FA between the right and left sides regardless of the anteroposterior positions. Regarding differences arising from the anteroposterior measurement positions, the ADC and FA showed no significant differences (p>0.017), except for the ADCs between the positions at the mandibular foramen and mental foramen in the left side (p=0.0068). Overall, 70 (76%) of the 92 IANs could be visualized fully or partially by tractography., CONCLUSIONS: The ADC and FA of the IAN were successfully obtained from healthy volunteers using DTI and were confirmed to be symmetrical regardless of the measurement positions. DTI is a feasible technique for the quantitative evaluation and visualization of the IAN.

N2  - Ultrasonography (US) is commonly used to assess the peripheral nerves of the lower extremity because of its many advantages over magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The most obvious advantages over MR imaging are superior soft-tissue resolution, low cost, portability, lack of magnetic susceptibility artifact, and the ability to image patients who cannot undergo MR imaging. US has been shown to have equal specificity and greater sensitivity than MR imaging in the evaluation of peripheral nerves. Additional benefits are the capability of real-time and dynamic imaging, and the ability to scan an entire extremity quickly without the need for a patient to lie motionless for long periods of time, as with MR imaging. Any abnormal findings can be easily compared against the contralateral side. Published literature has shown that US has clinical utility in patients suspected of having peripheral nerve disease: US can be used to guide diagnostic and therapeutic decisions, as well as help confirm electrodiagnostic findings. Common indications for lower extremity peripheral nerve US are the evaluation for injury due to penetrating trauma, entrapment by scar tissue, or tumor. To confidently perform US of the peripheral nerves of the lower extremity, it is important to gain a thorough knowledge of anatomic landmarks and the course of each nerve. Readers who may not be familiar with US will be introduced to the basics of scanning the peripheral nerves of the lower extremity. Important anatomic landmarks and common sites of injury and entrapment will be reviewed.Copyright (©)RSNA, 2016.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Epineural scar formation is one of the most significant negative factors affecting surgical repair after peripheral nerve injury. The scar tissue mechanically hinders axonal regeneration and causes adhesions between nerves and surrounding tissues. A hemostatic agent Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS; Immun Gida Ilac Kozmetik San. ve Tic. Ltd. Sti., Istanbul, Turkey) has not been previously used. Decreasing the postoperative bleeding and adhesions between nerve and surrounding tissues will prevent the formation of scar tissue, as well as corresponding compressive neuropathy and/or deceleration of axonal regeneration. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the effects of bleeding on nerve healing and scar tissue after repair of peripheral nerve injuries., METHODS: The right sciatic nerve of 30 Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 260-330 g) was cut 1.5 cm proximal to the trifurcation and repaired primarily with 8/0 sutures using epineural technique. The rats were then divided into 3 groups. Saline was applied in Group 1 (n=10), ABS in Group 2 (n=10), and heparin in Group 3 (n=10) for 5 minutes to the repair site and surrounding tissues. In each group, electrophysiological measurements were performed with electromyography (EMG) at postoperative week 12. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used at week 12. Macroscopical and histopathological evaluations were conducted after sacrificing the rats at week 24 with total excision of the repaired sciatic nerves and surrounding tissues., RESULTS: The ABS and saline groups showed better healing than the heparin group. The ABS and saline groups were better in the histopathologic evaluations, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups., CONCLUSION: Statistically significant differences were not found between the 3 groups. Significant results may be obtained with larger studies.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used in the study of the central nervous system. DTI represents a potential diagnostic tool for the peripheral nerve. However, more detailed information is needed for application of DTI in the clinical setting. In this study, peripheral degeneration and regeneration were evaluated using DTI-based analyses in a rabbit model. The changes in DTI parameters were compared to histological and functional changes after nerve injury. We used a high magnetic field (7.04T) MRI system. Japanese white male rabbits were used as the model of sciatic nerve crush injury. MR images were obtained before injury and at 2, 4, 6 and 8weeks post-injury. The DTI parameters of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (lambda ), and radial diffusivity (lambda) were calculated. Our results showed decreased FA and increased lambda during the degenerative phase after sciatic nerve injury. In contrast, increased FA and decreased lambda were observed during the regenerative phase. FA changes were correlated with axon number and with motor function recovery, assessed with the toe-spreading index. This study clearly demonstrates the validity of applying DTI parameters to the in vivo evaluation of peripheral nerve regeneration. Furthermore, results suggest that DTI can be a potent tool for predicting the extent of functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are widely used in the evaluation of the central nervous system and recently have been reported as a potential tool for diagnosis of the peripheral nerve or the lumbar nerve entrapment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate consecutive changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of normal lumbar nerve roots from the junction of the dura mater. Method(s): The lumbar spinal nerves were examined in 6 male healthy volunteers (mean age, 35 years) with no experiences of sciatica, with a 3.0-T MR unit using a five-element phased-array surface coil. DTI was performed with the following imaging parameters: 11084.6/73.7 ms for TR/TE; b-value, 800 s/mm2; MPG, 33 directions; slice thickness, 1.5 mm; and total scan time, 7 min 35 s. ADC and FA values at all consecutive points along the L4, L5 and S1 nerves were quantified on every 1.5 mm slice from the junction of the dura mater using short fiber tracking. Result(s): ADC values of all L4, 5, and S1 nerve roots decreased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction and was constant distally afterward. ADC values in the proximal portion demonstrated S1 > L5 > L4 (p < 0.05). On the other hand, FA values increased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction, and was constant distally afterward. FA values in the proximal portion showed L4 > L5 > S1 (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated that ADC and FA values of each L4, 5, and S1 at the proximal portion from the junction of the dura matter changed linearly. It would be useful to know the normal profile of DTI values by location of each nerve root so that we can detect subtle abnormalities in each nerve root.Copyright © 2015 Miyagi et al.

N2  - Tractography (or fiber tracking) consists of three-dimensional modeling of the preferential movement of water molecules in the form of fiber tracks from the tensor field information. This technique allows a new approach for the microarchitectural analysis of anisotropic structures such as nerves, white matter, and muscles. Many disorders have been studied including cervical myelopathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, nerve root compression, and nerve tumors. Muscles have been less evaluated. Tractography is still a research technique, and its validation and widespread routine clinical use will require a good deal of work toward a harmonization of the MRI protocols and data postprocessing methods.

N2  - Objectives To achieve 3-dimensional (3D) display of peripheral nerves in the wrist region by using maximum intensity projection (MIP) post-processing methods to reconstruct raw images acquired by a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan, and to explore its clinical applications. Methods We performed DTI scans in 6 (DTI6) and 25 (DTI25) diffusion directions on 20 wrists of 10 healthy young volunteers, 6 wrists of 5 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, 6 wrists of 6 patients with nerve lacerations, and one patient with neurofibroma. The MIP post-processing methods employed 2 types of DTI raw images: (1) single-direction and (2) T2-weighted trace. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median and ulnar nerves were measured at multiple testing sites. Two radiologists used custom evaluation scales to assess the 3D nerve imaging quality independently. Results In both DTI6 and DTI25, nerves in the wrist region could be displayed clearly by the 2 MIP post-processing methods. The FA and ADC values were not significantly different between DTI6 and DTI25, except for the FA values of the ulnar nerves at the level of pisiform bone (p = 0.03). As to the imaging quality of each MIP post-processing method, there were no significant differences between DTI6 and DTI25 (p > 0.05). The imaging quality of single-direction MIP post-processing was better than that from T2-weighted traces (p < 0.05) because of the higher nerve signal intensity. Conclusions Three-dimensional displays of peripheral nerves in the wrist region can be achieved by MIP post-processing for single-direction images and T2-weighted trace images for both DTI6 and DTI25. The FA and ADC values of the median nerves can be accurately measured by using DTI6 data. Adopting 6-direction DTI scan and MIP post-processing is an efficient method for evaluating peripheral nerves.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is hallmarked by degeneration of small unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers in the skin. Traditionally, it has been considered as a pure disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, previous work found that dysfunction of skin nerves led to abnormal recruitment of pain-related regions, suggesting that the brain may be affected in SFN. This report combined structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify structural and functional changes in the brain of 19 patients with SFN compared with 17 healthy controls. We applied tensor-based morphometry to detect brain structural alterations in SFN. Greater volume reduction in pain-processing regions, particularly the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices (ACCs), was associated with greater depletion of intraepidermal nerve fibers, a pathological biomarker of skin nerve degeneration. Based on the hypothesis that structural alterations in the pain-processing regions might impair their functional connectivity, we further applied psychophysiological interaction analysis to assess functional connectivity of the ACCs during noxious heat stimulation. There was significant reduction in functional connectivity from the ACCs to the limbic areas (the parahippocampal gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex), pain-processing area (the insula), and visuospatial areas (the cuneus). Moreover, the degree of reduction in functional connectivity for the ACC to the amygdala and the precuneus was linearly correlated with the severity of intraepidermal nerve fiber depletion. Our findings suggest that SFN is not a pure peripheral nervous system disorder. The pain-related brain networks tend to break into functionally independent components, with severity linked to the degree of skin nerve degeneration.Copyright © 2015 International Association for the Study of Pain.

N2  - Introduction We investigated the applicability of nerve ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Methods We systematically examined several nerves with ultrasound and the lumbar roots and tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa of nine CIDP patients with MRI additionally to the nerve conduction studies. Results Patients with overall disability sum score (ODSS) 2-3 were characterised by normal fascicular structure in MRI and ultrasound. Patients with higher ODSS showed isolated enlarged fascicles and increased cross sectional area (CSA) of the peripheral nerves and of the diameter of the cauda equina and L5 root, whereas two of them showed atrophic fascicles in both imaging techniques. Conclusions Nerve ultrasound and MRI findings show the same morphological fascicle alterations in peripheral nerves in correlation to ODSS. Nerve ultrasound as an affordable tool, easy and quick to perform, could replace MRI in daily routine for monitoring peripheral nerve morphology.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objectives: This study evaluated the potential of three-tesla diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography to detect changes of the radial (RN) and median (MN) nerves during transient upper arm compression by a silicon ring tourniquet. Method(s): Axial T2-weighted and DTI sequences (b = 700 s/mm2, 16 gradient encoding directions) of 13 healthy volunteers were obtained. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the MN and RN were measured at the spiral groove and further visualized in 3D by deterministic tractography (thresholds: FA =.15, angle change = 27degree). Result(s): Local/lesional RN FA values increased (p = 0.001) and ADC values decreased (p = 0.02) during a 20-min upper arm compression, whereas no significant FA (p = 0.49) or ADC (p = 0.73) changes of the MN were detected. There were no T2-w nerve signal changes or alterations of nerve trajectories in 3D. Conclusion(s): Acute nerve compression of the RN leads to changes of its three-tesla DTI metrics. Peripheral nerve DTI provides non-invasive insights into the "selective" vulnerability of the RN at the spiral groove. Key Points: * DTI-based neurography detects nerve changes during acute nerve compression. * Compression leads to a transient increase in local radial nerve FA values. * DTI provides insights into radial nerve vulnerability at the spiral groove.Copyright © 2015, European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) adds diagnostic accuracy in magnetic resonance neurography. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. We enrolled 16 patients with peripheral polyneuropathy of various etiologies involving the upper arm and 30 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3 T using transverse T2-weighted (T2-w) turbo spin echo and spin echo planar imaging diffusion-weighted sequences. T2-weighted normalized signal (nT2), fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) of the median, ulnar, and radial nerves were quantified after manual segmentation. Diagnostic performance of each separate parameter and combinations of parameters was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Bootstrap validation was used to adjust for potential overfitting. Results Average nT2, ADC, RD, and AD values of the median, ulnar, and radial nerve were significantly increased in neuropathy patients compared with that in healthy controls (nT2, 1.49 +/- 0.05 vs 1.05 +/- 0.05; ADC, 1.4 x 10-3 +/- 2.8 x 10-5 mm2/s vs 1.1 x 10-3 +/- 1.3 x 10-5 mm2/s; RD, 9.5 x 10-4 +/- 2.9 x 10-5 mm2/s vs 7.2 x 10-4 +/- 1.3 x 10-5 mm2/s; AD, 2.3 x 10-3 +/- 3.7 x 10-5 mm2/s vs 2.0 x 10-3 +/- 2.2 x 10-5 mm2/s; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Fractional anisotropy values were significantly decreased in patients (0.51 +/- 0.01 vs 0.59 +/- 0.01; P < 0.001). T2-weighted normalized signal and DTI parameters had comparable diagnostic accuracy (adjusted AUC: T2-w, 0.92; FA, 0.88; ADC, 0.89; AD, 0.84; RD, 0.86). Combining DTI parameters significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy over single-parameter analysis. In addition, the combination of nT2 with DTI parameters yielded excellent adjusted AUCs up to 0.97 (nT2 + FA). Conclusions Diffusion tensor imaging has high diagnostic accuracy in peripheral neuropathy. Combining DTI with T2 can outperform T2-w imaging alone and provides added value in magnetic resonance neurography.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The aim of this study was to develop a method to generate multi-organ acellular matrices. Using a foetal sheep model have developed a method of systemic pulsatile perfusion via the umbilical artery which allows for simultaneous multi-organ decellularization. Twenty sheep foetuses were systemically perfused with Triton X-100 and sodium dodecyl sulphate. Following completion of the whole-body decellularization, multiple biopsy samples were taken from different parts of 21 organs to ascertain complete cell component removal in the preserved extracellular matrices. Both the natural and decellularized organs were subjected to several examinations. The samples were obtained from the skin, eye, ear, nose, throat, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, musculoskeletal, central nervous and peripheral nervous systems. The histological results depicted well-preserved extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity and intact vascular structures, without any evidence of residual cellular materials, in all decellularized bioscaffolds. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and biochemical properties remained intact, similar to their age-matched native counterparts. Preservation of the collagen structure was evaluated by a hydroxyproline assay. Dense organs such as bone and muscle were also completely decellularized, with a preserved ECM structure. Thus, as shown in this study, several organs and different tissues were decellularized using a perfusion-based method, which has not been previously accomplished. Given the technical challenges that exist for the efficient generation of biological scaffolds, the current results may pave the way for obtaining a variety of decellularized scaffolds from a single donor. In this study, there have been unique responses to the single acellularization protocol in foetuses, which may reflect the homogeneity of tissues and organs in the developing foetal body.Copyright © 2015 International Journal of Experimental Pathology.

N2  - Accumulated evidence from experimental animal models suggests that neuronal loss within the dorsal horn is involved in the development and/or maintenance of peripheral neuropathic pain. However, to date, no study has specifically investigated whether such neuroanatomical changes also occur at this level in humans. Using brain imaging techniques, we sought to determine whether anatomical changes were present in the spinal trigeminal nucleus in subjects with chronic orofacial neuropathic pain. In 22 subjects with painful trigeminal neuropathy and 44 pain-free controls, voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted anatomical images and diffusion tensor images were used to assess regional gray matter volume and microstructural changes within the brainstem. In addition, deterministic tractography was used to assess the integrity of ascending pain pathways. Orofacial neuropathic pain was associated with significant regional gray matter volume decreases, fractional anisotropy increases, and mean diffusivity decreases within the spinal trigeminal nucleus, specifically the subnucleus oralis. In addition, tractography revealed no significant differences in diffusivity properties in the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve, the spinal trigeminal tract, or the ventral trigeminothalamic tracts in painful trigeminal neuropathy subjects compared with controls. These data reveal that chronic neuropathic pain in humans is associated with discrete alterations in the anatomy of the primary synapse. These neuroanatomical changes may be critical for the generation and/or maintenance of pathological pain.Copyright © 2015 the authors.

N2  - The majority of previous studies on hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) were focused on peripheral nerves, whereas cerebral alterations in HNPP have been less attended to. In this work, DTI was used to detect the changes in WM, especially in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in HNPP patients for its sensitivity in probing the microstructure of WM, the sensitive metric was searched for probing cerebral alterations and the regional distribution of cerebral abnormalities was identified. Twelve HNPP patients and 12 age-and gender-matched healthy controls underwent the conventional MRI, DTI scan, and electrophysiological examination. The conventional MRI images were first analyzed to identify abnormal intense regions and the NAWM regions. NAWM refers to the white matter regions that do not include the lesions on conventional MRI. The ADC and FA values of the NAWM were then measured and compared between patient and control groups. The sensitivity and specificity of 3 methods and the cerebral regional distribution of MR signal abnormalities were further analyzed. Hyperintense foci were observed on T2WI and FLAIR images in 6 patients. Compared to the controls, FA values of the patients were significantly lower in bilateral frontal, orbitofrontal, and temporal NAWMs; whereas the electrophysiological examination results of patients and controls exhibited no statistically significant difference. The sensitivity of FA value was higher than that of electrophysiological examination and conventional MRI. The majority of abnormal signals on conventional MRI images and abnormal FA values were located in the frontal and temporal lobes. The results of our study show cerebral WM changes in HNPP patients. FA value in DTI has been shown to be sensitive to the cerebral microstructural changes in HNPP. The frontal lobe is the predilection site that is most involved in HNPP.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a powerful MR imaging technique that can be used to probe the microstructural environment of highly anisotropic tissues such as peripheral nerves. DTI has been used predominantly in the central nervous system, and its application in the peripheral nervous system does pose some challenges related to imaging artifacts, the small caliber of peripheral nerves, and low water proton density. However advances in MRI hardware and software have made it possible to use the technique in the peripheral nervous system and to obtain functional data relating to the effect of pathologic processes on peripheral nerves. This article reviews the imaging principles behind DTI and examines the literature regarding its application in assessing peripheral nerves.Copyright © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) are neoplasms derived from neoplastic Schwann cells or their precursors. Whereas benign PNSTs are relatively common and considered curable lesions, their malignant counterparts are rare but highly aggressive and require early diagnosis and treatment. MR imaging has been the modality of choice for noninvasive evaluation of PNSTs. This article discusses the features of PNSTs in conventional and advanced MR imaging, and it emphasizes the features that help differentiate benign and malignant variants.Copyright © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Pathologic conditions of the brachial plexus often result in serious and disabling complications. With the increasing availability and use of new and powerful MRI sequences and coils, understanding and assessment of the complex anatomy and pathology of the brachial plexus have been greatly facilitated. These new technical developments have led to an improved assessment of brachial plexus lesions, thereby improving patient care. In this article we describe various MRI techniques for the evaluation of the brachial plexus obtained at 1.5 T and 3 T, and we explain differences and similarities between sequences and protocols performed on MRI equipment from different vendors. The main characteristics of pathologic conditions affecting the brachial plexus are discussed and illustrated, as well as their differential diagnoses, with an emphasis on key imaging findings and relevance for patient management. Pitfalls related to suboptimal technique and image interpretation are also addressed.Copyright © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a peripheral nerve disorder which impacts the living quality of patients both psychologically and physically. Whether HFS has structural changes under these specific stressors including psychological and physiological conditions in the CNS remains largely unknown. In the current study, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to evaluate changes in gray matter (GM) by using T1-weighted imaging in 25 HFS patients and 25 demographically similar healthy volunteers. The severity of the spasm was assessed using a Cohen evaluation scale. Hamilton anxiety (HAMA) and Hamilton depression (HAMD) rating scales were used to evaluate the affective conditions of subjects. 3D-FIESTA and 3D-TOF sequences were applied to evaluate the neurovascular compression (NVC) rating in each subject. In our results, we found that HFS patients had higher NVC rating scores than those of healthy volunteers, and the spasm severity rating was positively correlated with the NVC rating (. r=. 0.736, p<. 0.001). HFS patients had higher scores on the HAMA and HAMD compared with healthy volunteers. For the GM comparison, reductions were found in the thalamus, putamen, pallidum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus in patients with HFS compared with healthy volunteers. Additionally, the GM volume changes in the amygdala did not exhibit any significant between-group differences with HAMA and HAMD scores as covariates. Our results suggested that HFS probably led to GM volume abnormalities of the CNS. We indicated that the GM volume changes of the amygdala may be highly related to emotional factors.Copyright © 2015 IBRO.

T1  - Corticotropin releasing hormone and imaging, rethinking the stress axis
A1  - Contoreggi, Carlo 
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - The stress system provides integration of both neurochemical and somatic physiologic functions within organisms as an adaptive mechanism to changing environmental conditions throughout evolution. In mammals and primates the complexity and sophistication of these systems have surpassed other species in triaging neurochemical and physiologic signaling to maximize chances of survival. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and its related peptides and receptors have been identified over the last three decades and are fundamental molecular initiators of the stress response. They are crucial in the top down regulatory cascade over a myriad of neurochemical, neuroendocrine and sympathetic nervous system events. From neuroscience, we've seen that stress activation impacts behavior, endocrine and somatic physiology and influences neurochemical events that one can capture in real time with current imaging technologies. To delineate these effects one can demonstrate how the CRH neuronal networks infiltrate critical cognitive, emotive and autonomic regions of the central nervous system (CNS) with somatic effects. Abundant preclinical and clinical studies show inter-regulatory actions of CRH with multiple neurotransmitters/peptides. Stress, both acute and chronic has epigenetic effects which magnify genetic susceptibilities to alter neurochemistry; stress system activation can add critical variables in design and interpretation of basic and clinical neuroscience and related research. This review will attempt to provide an overview of the spectrum of known functions and speculative actions of CRH and stress responses in light of imaging technology and its interpretation. Metabolic and neuroreceptor positron emission/single photon tomography (PET/SPECT), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), anatomic MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (pMRS) are technologies that can delineate basic mechanisms of neurophysiology and pharmacology. Stress modulates the myriad of neurochemical and networks within and controlled through the central and peripheral nervous system and the effects of stress activation on imaging will be highlighted.Copyright © 2014.

N2  - We evaluated safety and feasibility of high-pressure transvenous limb perfusion in an upper extremity of adult patients with muscular dystrophy, after completing a similar study in a lower extremity. A dose escalation study of single-limb perfusion with 0.9% saline was carried out in nine adults with muscular dystrophies under intravenous analgesia. Our study demonstrates that it is feasible and definitely safe to perform high-pressure transvenous perfusion with 0.9% saline up to 35% of limb volume in the upper extremities of young adults with muscular dystrophy. Perfusion at 40% limb volume is associated with short-lived physiological changes in peripheral nerves without clinical correlates in one subject. This study provides the basis for a phase 1/2 clinical trial using pressurized transvenous delivery into upper limbs of nonambulatory patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, our results are applicable to other conditions such as limb girdle muscular dystrophy as a method for delivering regional macromolecular therapeutics in high dose to skeletal muscles of the upper extremity.Copyright © 2015 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters as in-vivo biomarkers of axon and myelin sheath integrity of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. Method(s): MRI examinations at 3T including DTI were conducted on wrists in 30 healthy subjects. After manual segmentation of the median nerve quantitative analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as axial, radial and mean diffusivity (AD, RD, and MD) was carried out. Pairwise Pearson correlations with electrophysiological parameters comprising sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) as markers of axon integrity, and distal motor latency (dml) and sensory nerve conduction velocity (sNCV) as markers of myelin sheath integrity were computed. The significance criterion was set at P=0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. Result(s): DTI parameters showed a distinct proximal-to-distal profile with FA, MD, and RD extrema coinciding in the center of the carpal tunnel. AD correlated with CMAP (r=0.50, p=0.04, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of myelin sheath integrity. RD correlated with sNCV (r=-0.53, p=0.02, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of axon integrity. FA correlated with dml (r=-0.63, p=0.002, Bonf. corr.) and sNCV (r=0.68, p=0.001, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of axon integrity. Conclusion(s): AD reflects axon integrity, while RD (and FA) reflect myelin sheath integrity as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. DTI parameters consistently indicate a slight decrease of structural integrity in the carpal tunnel as a physiological site of median nerve entrapment. DTI is particularly sensitive, since these findings are observed in healthy participants. Our results encourage future studies to evaluate the potential of DTI in differentiating axon from myelin sheath injury in patients with manifest peripheral neuropathies.Copyright © 2015 Heckel et al.

N2  - Introduction: This diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) study aimed to clarify the relationship of peripheral nerves and soft tissue tumors (STTs) in 3D to optimize subsequent treatment. Method(s): Twenty-six consecutive STT patients (histologically malignant, n=10; intermediate, n=3; and benign, n=13) underwent 3-Tesla MRI using an echoplanar DTI sequence. Deterministic tractography was performed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured within peritumoral and distant regions of interest. Result(s): Tractography depicted the 3D course of the sciatic (n=12), femoral (n=2), tibial (n=7), fibular (n=2), median (n=1), musculocutaneous (n=1), and ulnar (n=1) nerves in a regular (n=8 of 18, 44.4%) or thinned (n=7 of 18, 38.9%) fashion. The lowest peritumoral FA values, abrupt thinning, and/or complete discontinuity of trajectories were found in 2 cases with histologically proven tumoral nerve infiltration. Conclusion(s): DTI clarifies the 3D topography between major peripheral nerves and STTs and may be helpful in the assessment of peripheral nerve infiltration by malignant tumors.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Acute longitudinal myelitis as the first presentation in child with systemic lupus erythematosus concurrent with positive antiphospholipid antibody
A1  - Amal, Al-Qassimi

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-system auto-immune disorder that is characterized by widespread immune deregulation, formation of auto-antibodies, and immune complexes, resulting in inflammation and potential damage to variety of organs. 25-95% it is complicated by neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms, which is referred to as neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). NPSLE contain both central and peripheral nervous systems, which includes transverse myelitis. We report our experience of concurrent manifestation of transverse myelitis as an initial presentation of SLE, which suggests the common immune-mediated mechanisms of diseases. We here report the case of a 7-year-old girl with SLE who first presented with features of TM. The patient developed ascending weakness starting from low extremities, experienced difficulty in voiding. An initial diagnosis of TM was made on the basis of clinical findings and MRI spine, which displayed T2 weighted high signal intensities at thoracic level. She partially respond to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and serological analysis revealed the presence of anti-dsDNA, anti nuclear antibody with decreased level of complements. The diagnosis was revised to acute transverse myelitis resulting from SLE. Additional methylprednisolone pulse therapy led to rapid clinical improvement. This was followed by oral prednisolone and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy. The crossreactivity of auto-antibodies and increased susceptibility to infection owing to immunologic changes associated with lupus may form the basis of the association. Systemic Lupus Erytheromyitis should consider as an etiology of transverse myelitis. Aggressive treatment may alter the course and lead to a better outcome.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the ultrasound (US) characteristics of peripheral nerves in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and their correlations with electrodiagnostic (EDX) characteristics. Method(s): Nineteen patients with CIDP and 19 healthy controls matched by age and body mass index were included in a blind case-control, observational study. All patients underwent a neurologic examination (including inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment [INCAT] and Medical Research Council [MRC] sum score) and an EDX study. Each patient and each control underwent a US study of 14 nerve segments, yielding a total number of 266 segments scanned in each group. Result(s): US changes, characterized by an increased nerve cross-sectional area (NCSA), were detected in 53% of the 266 patient nerve segments. Mean NCSA was higher in nerve segments of patients than in those of controls (p < 0.001). Nerve segments with abnormal US belonged to patients with longer disease duration, lower MRC sum score, higher INCAT score, and progressive disease form (all p < 0.0001). All the aforementioned variables were independently associated with the occurrence of US changes. Motor nerve conduction was significantly lower in nerve segments with increased NCSA than in those with normal NCSA (p < 0.0001). NCSA in segments with prevalent myelin damage was higher than that in segments with prevalent axonal damage (p 0.001) or in segments with normal EDX characteristics (p < 0.0001). NCSA and motor nerve conduction velocity were inversely correlated in nerve segments with EDX evidence of myelin damage (R 0.599; p < 0.0001). Conduction blocks were associated with increased NCSA (p 0.001). Conclusion(s): US may, similar to MRI, have a supporting role in the diagnosis of CIDP. US and EDX changes are correlated.Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Introduction: In this study we sought to determine the cross-sectional area (CSA) of peripheral nerves in patients with distinct subtypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Method(s): Ulnar and median nerve ultrasound was performed in 78 ALS patients [classic, n=21; upper motor neuron dominant (UMND), n=14; lower motor neuron dominant (LMND), n=20; bulbar, n=15; primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), n=8] and 18 matched healthy controls. Result(s): Compared with controls, ALS patients had significant, distally pronounced reductions of ulnar CSA (forearm/wrist level) across all disease groups, except for PLS. Median nerve CSA (forearm/wrist level) did not differ between controls and ALS. Conclusion(s): Ulnar nerve ultrasound in ALS subgroups revealed significant differences in distal CSA values, which suggests it has value as a marker of LMN involvement. Its potential was particularly evident in the UMND and PLS groups, which can be hard to separate clinically, yet their accurate separation has major prognostic implications.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - In a blind case-control, observational study, we have evaluated the ultrasound (US) characteristics of peripheral nerves in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and their correlations with electrodiagnostic (EDX) characteristics. Nineteen patients with CIDP and nineteen healthy controls matched by age and body mass index were included. All patients underwent a neurologic examination (including inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment [INCAT] and Medical Research Council [MRC] sum score) and an EDX study. Each patient and each control underwent a US study of 14 nerve segments, yielding a total number of 266 segments scanned in each group. US changes, characterized by an increased nerve cross-sectional area (NCSA), were detected in 53% of the 266 patient nerve segments. Mean NCSA was higher in nerve segments of patients than in those of controls (p<0.001). Nerve segments with abnormal US belonged to patients with longer disease duration, lower MRC sum score, higher INCAT score, and progressive disease form (all p<0.0001). All the aforementioned variables were independently associated with the occurrence of US changes. Motor nerve conduction was significantly lower in nerve segments with increased NCSA than in those with normal NCSA (p<0.0001). NCSA in segments with prevalent myelin damage was higher than that in segments with prevalent axonal damage (p=0.001) or in segments with normal EDX characteristics (p<0.0001). NCSA and motor nerve conduction velocity were inversely correlated in nerve segments with EDX evidence of myelin damage (R=0.599; p<0.0001). Conduction blocks were associated with increased NCSA (p=0.001). These findings suggest that US may, similar to MRI, have a supporting role in the diagnosis of CIDP and that US and EDX changes are correlated.

N2  - Pain and sensory symptoms, such as dysesthesia or burning feet, of neuropathies have been traditionally attributed to alteration of the peripheral nervous system, i.e., peripheral sensitization. Several lines of evidence have indicated that parameters of peripheral nerve degeneration, for example intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) density on skin biopsies, could not completely explain the presence of pain in neuropathies. These observations raised the potential effects of peripheral nerve degeneration on the supraspinal structures. Previous research on neuropathic pain mainly focused on one level of neural axis, for example, at peripheral nerves or in the brain. It is not clear whether there existed brain plasticity alterations in peripheral neuropathies. To address this issue, this study examined the peripheral nerve terminals and the brain imaging on patients with small fiber neuropathy (SFN) by combining skin biopsy and functional MRI on 19 SFN patients compared with 17 healthy controls. We applied tensor-based morphometry to detect brain structural alterations in SFN. Greater volume reduction in pain-processing regions, particularly the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices (ACC), was associated with greater reduction of IENF density, serving as a pathological biomarker of skin nerve degeneration. We further applied psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis to assess functional connectivity of the ACCs during noxious heat stimulation. There was significant reduction in functional connectivity from the ACCs to the limbic structures (the parahippocampal gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex), pain-processing area (the insula), and visuospatial areas (the cuneus). Furthermore, the degree of reduction in functional connectivity for the ACC to the amygdala and the precuneus was linearly correlated with the severity of IENF depletion. These observations suggest that SFN is not a pure PNS disorder. The pain-related brain networks tend to break into functionally independent components, with severity linked to the degree of skin nerve degeneration. These patterns provide imaging signatures of skin nerve degeneration-induced brainmaladaptive plasticity.

N2  - Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is diagnosed based on neurophysiological and clinical examination. Previously, studies have shown that MRI of peripheral nerves in several types of polyneuropathy may be helpful. Diffusion Tensor Images (DTI) with calculation of Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values has shown a higher FA-value of the tibial nerve in healthy subjects compared to CIDP patients. MRI of the peripheral nerves in both thighs (sciatic nerve or peroneal/tibial nerve) was performed using the knee coil on a 3 T Siemens Magnetom Skyra MR-scanner. At each thigh one cross section (20 pct. of the distance from upper patella to superior anterior spine of iliaca) was selected for imaging. Seventeen slices were obtained (slice thickness/distance 4:2mm) performing T2-and DTI-weighted MRI sequences with fat saturation. Data from DTI-weighted images served for pixel-by-pixel calculation of FA-values. Circular region-of-interest (ROI) were manually segmented around the nerves at each image slice, carefully avoiding measurement of surrounding tissue with reference to the high-resolution T2-weighted images (0.3x0.3 mm). Average FA-values was calculated from the nerve ROI for each patient with a pixel resolution of 1.36x1.36mm. MRI was performed before and after 3 months of treatment with GammanormR 16.5% in drug-naive CIDP patients, at an arbitrary time point in CIDP patients during maintenance treatment with GammanormR and in healthy controls. We plan inclusion of 15 SCIG-treated CIDP patients, 10 drug-naive CIDP patients and 15 healthy controls. The study is progressing. 1) A 58-year-old female, diagnosed with CIDP. Treated for 3 months with GammanormR 0.33 g/kg/week. MRI of both thighs showed an overall FA-value of 0.41+/-0.02 vs. 0.44+/-0.04 before vs. after initiation of treatment. 2) A 59-year-old male, diagnosed with CIDP and treated with GammanormR 0.36 g/kg/week for several months. MRI of both thighs showed an overall FA-value of 0.40+/-0.01. 3) A 59-year-old male, healthy control. MRI of both thighs showed and overall FA-value of 0.47+/-0.001. These preliminary results indicate that FA-value is lower in patients with CIDP and probably the FA-value will increase following treatment with GammanormR.

N2  - Introduction: The majority of growing and/or symptomatic peripheral nerve tumors are schwannomas and neurofibromas. They are almost always benign and can usually be fully surgically resected while sparing motor and sensory function if approached with the proper expertise and techniques. Intraoperative electrophysiological stimulation and recording techniques allow the surgeon to map the surface of the tumor in an effort to identify and thereby avoid damaging functioning nerve fibers. Recently, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MR DTI) techniques have permitted the visualization of axons, due to their anisotropic properties, in peripheral nerves. Method(s): MR DTI data and intraoperative data were collected prospectively for seven patients with peripheral nerve tumors that were surgically resected. We compared preoperative identification of nerve fiber location in relation to the surface of the nerve tumor as seen on MR DTI studies with their intraoperative localization using electrophysiological stimulation and recordings. Result(s): We found good correlation between nerve fiber location seen on MR DTI and anatomic nerve fiber location seen intraoperatively. MR DTI demonstrated 85.7% sensitivity, 92.9% specificity, 92% positive predictive value and 87% negative predictive value in determining the relationship of nerve fibers relative to the tumor. Conclusion(s): We conclude that preoperative MR DTI techniques are extremely reliable as an imaging modality and are very useful in helping the peripheral nerve surgeon to both determine the risks involved in resecting a nerve tumor as well as in planning the safest surgical approach.

N2  - Introduction: Presently, the most reliable methods for peripheral nerve repair depend on microsutures, nerve conduits, and/or autologous nerve grafts. However, even with these techniques functional recovery depends on a lengthy process that involves axonal outgrowth, which occurs at a rate of 1-3 mm/day. Polyethylene-glycol (PEG) has proven the ability to improve behavioral outcomes in animal models immediately following nerve transection. We hypothesized that this technique could restore axonal continuity as assessed by high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging. Method(s): Bilateral rat sciatic nerves were transected and repaired in 6 animals using standard microsurgical techniques. Experimental animals received Plasmalyte-A, 1% methylene blue, PEG, and Lactated Ringers; control animals did not receive PEG. Electrophysiological recordings were acquired pre-injury and post-repair. High-resolution diffusion tensor images were obtained using diffusion-weighted spin-echo acquisitions at 4.7-tesla. Result(s): We found that PEG-fused nerves had restored axonal continuity immediately following application of PEG. 83% (5/6) of PEG-fused nerves had restored compound action potential (CAP) function, while 0% (0/6) of control animals showed returned CAP function. Additionally, diffusion tensor tractography displayed a significantly increased (p<0.01) number of axonal tracts through the repair site in PEG-fused nerves. Furthermore, fractional anisotropy was increased at the injury sites of PEG-fused nerves compared to control nerves. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PEG-fused nerves immediately restore axonal continuity. We believe that this novel nerve fusion technique may produce a change in the clinical management of traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves. Additionally, high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging is a promising tool for future diagnosis and tracking of traumatic nerve injuries.

N2  - Purpose: To characterize and quantify the tibial nerve gross anatomy with an acquisition and segmentation protocol of Magnetic Resonance (MR) microneurography using 3D Spoiled Gradient Echo (SPGR) with IDEAL sequences. Method(s): 14 healthy volunteers were investigated at the ankle level to obtain axial MR images of the posterior tibial nerve. Imaging was performed on a Discovery MR750 3T scanner (GE Healthcare, USA). Acquisition parameters: IDEAL 3D SPGR with TR 16 ms, TE 6 ms, flip angle 10degree, matrix size 512 x 420, FOV 5 cm, slice thickness 2 mm for a coverage of 2.8cm, bandwidth 25 kHz, NEX 1, time scan approx. 7 min. The nerve was manually segmented by two experienced operators (PFF, SB) in the IN Phase image, where the nerve boundary was clearly visible. This region of interest (ROI) was used to mask the nerve in the water image, where 2 class segmentation was performed using FSL FAST 1. Fascicular volume (FV), epineurial volume (EV), nerve volume (NV), and fascicular to nerve volume ratio (FNR) were quantified in the 2.8 cm covered using partial volume estimation. Inter-observer agreement was computed using interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Result(s): MR microneurograms demonstrated the various components of the nerve such as the external and internal epineurium, the nerve fascicles and even the perineurium. In the 2.8 cm covered, NV average was 276 mm3. The mean FV was 192 mm3 (range 124-251 mm3). The mean EV was 83mm3 (range 52-137 mm3). The mean FNR was 0.69% (range 61- 76%). The interobserver reliability was excellent for both FNR and NV (ICC of 0.975 and 0.967 respectively). Conclusion(s): Morphological detail usually achieved with conventional MR neurography is insufficient for automatic segmentation of nerve structure. We propose an acquisition and segmentation protocol for reliable quantification of peripheral nerve structural parameters thanks to the high resolution ofMRmicroneurography. NVand FVmaymeasure nerve and fascicular enlargement reflecting edema. EV may be correlated with intraepineurial adipose proliferation in chronic neuropathies. Despite of a limited coverage, our results are promising and suggest a possible role of MR microneurography in characterizing the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of peripheral nerve damage.

N2  - Purpose:We describe theMRI features in a case of brachial plexopathy in a 39 year old patient, in intensive care unit (ICU) for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), related to H1N1 pneumonia. Method(s): Approximately three weeks after the onset of symptoms, the patient underwent an MRI scan on Philips Achieva 1.5 T with Head - Neck 16 channels coil. Sequences: TSE T2-weighted, T1w, DP fat saturated, STIR, THRIVE, DWIBS, T2 dixon, T1w dixon with and without contrast injection. Result(s): On MRI examination presence of diffuse STIR hyperintensity of the right brachial plexus, extended from the roots (C5-C8) to the terminal branches, with an increase in volume of the (C6, C7) roots and the upper and middle trunks. Scan demonstrated mild edema and minimal enhancement of the supraspinatus. On the left side slight hyperintensity on STIR of C5 root and the upper primary trunk. Conclusion(s): Our patient developed severe ARDS due to H1N1 pneumonia; he underwent prone positioning in the ICU. After discontinuation of sedatives he complained of right shoulder pain.Neurological examination confirmed a severe motor neuropathy. Right shoulder x-ray showed no bone fracture but a small widening of the acromioclavicular joint. His symptoms improved over the next 2 weeks. In literature only a few case reports of brachial plexus injury after prone position in the intensive care unit are reported. Peripheral nerve injury is thought to be the result of nerve ischaemia from undue stretching or direct pressure. Brachial plexus injuries most frequently affect the supraclavicular region rather than the retroclavicular or infraclavicular levels. The roots and the trunks are more commonly injured. However, in our case both supraclavicular and infraclavicular structures showed signal hyperintensity on STIR. Furthermore T2 hyperintensity was present bilaterally even if with asymmetric presentation. We think that an inflammatory pathogenesis could better explain the MRI features. Although we found some case reports of brachial plexopathy in patients affected by viral infections or bacterial sepsis, we didn't find any reports on patients with H1N1, but curiously several cases occurring after flue vaccination (trivalent).

N2  - The brachial plexus is a complex anatomic structure which cannot be fully displayed with conventional 2D MR imaging. The introduction of phased array coil technology and the advent of parallel imaging with multielement RF-coils have increased the SNR of high resolution MRI while dramatically shortening imaging times, therefore enabling volumetric acquisition of MRI data. New variants of 3D FSE sequences that differ from conventional FSE sequences by long FSE readout and flip angle modulation allow rapid image formation with diminished CSF flow artifacts and high contrast resolution between spinal cord, nerve roots and subarachnoid spaces. These sequences, named with different acronyms according to manufacturer (SPACE, FSE-XETA, VISTA) represent the best solution for 3D MR Myelography, by acquiring high resolution 3D volumes and subsequently generating curved-planar or multiplanar reformats along the course of cervical nerve roots. MRMyelography based on 3D SPACE sequences is routinely used in our Department for the evaluation of traumatic injuries of the brachial plexus in which the preoperative assessment of nerve root avulsions is essential for surgical planning. The whole spectra of imaging findings, including traumatic pseudo-meningoceles and partial or complete nerve root avulsions can be easily identified with carefully selected submillimetric multiplanar reformats. In conventional MRI studies peripheral nerves are poorly visualized due to low contrast resolution between nerves, muscles and vessels, signal intensity variability, pulsatility artifacts and small size of the nerves. MR Neurography, a tissue-selective imaging, based on T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression, directed at identifying and evaluating characteristics of nerve morphology, has been widely used for the evaluation of traumatic injuries, nerve entrapment syndromes and nerve tumors. The development of high resolution 3DMR neurography techniques has significantly improved the radiological approach to the investigation of brachial plexus, due to enhanced contrast between nerves and muscles and multiplanar capabilities, which allow coronal MIP views with simultaneous display of the roots, primary trunks, divisions and cords of the brachial plexus. 3DMR neurography is especially useful for the investigation of immunemediated brachial plexopathies, which are characterized by different patterns of enlargement and increased signal intensity, whose identification may be relevant for the diagnosis. DTI is a novel technique which has been recently applied to the evaluation of peripheral nerve disorders. This technique is sensitive to subtle changes in tissue at themicrostructural level and allows quantitativemeasurement of nerve microstructural integrity. DTI tractography has been successfully applied to the median nerve at the carpal tunnel and sciatic nerves, however it cannot be as readily and reliably performed in the investigation of brachial plexus for technical and anatomical reasons such as susceptibility and pulsation artefacts as well as motion of organs in the thorax. A standardized method for DTI tractography at 1.5T has been developed in our institution for the investigation of traumatic injuries of the brachial plexus, in which a reliable diagnosis of nerve root avulsion can be obtained with a functional rather than a conventional anatomic approach.

N2  - Microtubule-based motors carry cargo back and forth from the synaptic region to the cell body. We are using magnetic resonance imaging to study cell biological processes, such as transport, in the brain of intact living animals. Mutations in KIF5A, the human gene encoding the heavy chain of conventional kinesin-1, result in axonal transport causing peripheral neuropathies. Some mutations in human KIF5A also cause severe central nervous system defects, yet kinesin-1 activity is involved in any particular tract in the central nervous system is unknown. While transport dynamics in the peripheral nervous system are well characterized experimentally, transport in the central nervous system is less experimentally accessible. Here we study transport dynamics within the central nervous system of living mice with and without kinesin light chain 1 (KO KLC-1). We injected an MRI tract tracer, Mn2+, together with a classic histologic tracer, rhodamine dextran, into CA3 of the posterior hippocampus. We imaged axonal transport in vivo by capturing whole-brain 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI) at discrete time points after injection. To determine histologic location of tracer, the mice were sacrificed, perfusion-fixed and embedded for serial whole brain sectioning in register and examined by fluorescence microscopy and histologic staining of alternate sections. The MR images were skull-tripped, align-warped and analyzed by statistical parametric mapping with ANOVA to compare intensities at successive time points within genotype and between genotypes. The position of the Mn2+-enhanced MR signal as it proceeded from the injection site into the forebrain, the expected projection from CA3 was delayed in KLC-KO mice at early time points, yet achieved destinations comparable to wild type littermates at 25 hr, similar to our previous publication on transport in the optic tract (Bearer et al. 2007). Histologic examination confirmed precision of the injection site and revealed smaller brain size with normal anatomy in the KLCKO compared to wild type, while color-coded rendering of diffusion tensor MR images demonstrated relatively normal anatomy. We conclude that kinesin-1 defects diminish the rate of axonal transport within the living brain and thus cause cognitive impairments, possibly due to decreased synaptic vesicle replenishment at active synapses. Finally this study demonstrates the power of MEMRI to observe and measure transport dynamics in the central nervous system caused by defects in motors which may result from or lead to brain pathology.

N2  - Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has successfully been used to investigate ALS-related changes in the central nervous system (CNS). Many studies reported, for example, decreased white matter integrity in the cortico-spinal tract (CST). Consequently, DTI has been proposed as a potential biomarker to support clinical diagnosis. While recent results look promising in principle, the reliability of DTI-based diagnosis seems currently insufficient for practical use. To enhance discriminative performance, one would ideally integrate information from complementary diagnostic modalities during classifier construction. Objective(s): In a recent study, we observed ALS-related thinning of different peripheral nerves based on cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements using high-resolution ultrasound (Schreiber et al., 2014). Here, we combined DTI-based measures of the CST with CSA of the upper limb peripheral nerves to improve imaging-based discrimination between different ALS subtypes and healthy controls. Method(s): 51 patients with ALS (14 classic, 10 upper motor neuron dominant (UMND), 14 lower motor neuron dominant (LMND), 8 bulbar, and 5 primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)) and 18 healthy controls underwent diffusion-weighted MRI at 3T and peripheral nerve ultrasound in order to determine the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter underneath the motor cortex, posterior limb of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, pons and medulla oblongata as well as the CSA of the N. medianus and the N. ulnaris. Statistical comparisons were conducted using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Classifier construction was carried using linear discriminants after dimensionality reduction based on principal component analysis. Separate classifiers were constructed using FA, CSA, and both FA and CSA data, respectively. Result(s): Compared to controls, ALS patients exhibited significant, distally pronounced reductions of the ulnar nerve CSA across all subtypes with the exception of PLS. In addition, DTI data revealed significant differences between ALS subtypes with pronounced impairment of the CST in UMND and PLS and modest impairment in LMND patients, while bulbar ALS is intermediately located within this spectrum. Classification performance was considerably higher exploiting both central and peripheral data compared to using either modality alone. Most notably, UMND and PLS patients could be accurately separated. Conclusion(s): Combining central and peripheral data acquired through DTI and ultrasound, respectively, leads to improved discrimination not only between ALS and healthy controls, but also between ALS subtypes. This speaks to the complementary role of both methods regarding their contribution to classification performance. The potential of combining both imaging methods is particularly evident in the reliable separation of UMND and PLS patients, since early differentiation of these subtypes remains a difficult problem in clinical practice.

N2  - Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy is a common post-operative complication of many head and neck surgeries. RLN damage often occurs because the RLN is a small peripheral nerve with a highly variable medial/lateral position within the larynx. There is great need for a diagnostic imaging method that can be used to view the specific anatomy of a particular patient prior to surgery to minimize complications. Current literature has shown that the pig is an excellent model for laryngeal anatomy and physiology. In this study, porcine cadaveric larynx specimens were used to develop high-resolution MR imaging sequences that yield clear images of the RLN as it courses along the tracheoesophageal groove, and branches to innervate the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. We present pilot data of several three-dimensional (3D) models of porcine RLN structure. Models were generated via segmentation of images using Amira (FEI, Inc.). To confirm the branching pattern, each larynx specimen was dissected to expose the RLN, and then the branches were digitized using a MicroScribe robotic arm. The data were reconstructed to provide a higher resolution, and comparable 3D structure of each RLN specimen. RLN models made via MRI segmentation were meticulously compared to models made via MicroScribe digitization to ensure structural accuracy. We intend to optimize our imaging protocols for use on human patients as a diagnostic imaging technique to augment surgical planning.

N2  - Diagnosis and management of peripheral nerve injury is complicated by the inability to assess microstructural features of injured nerve fibers via clinical examination and electrophysiology. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to accurately detect nerve injury and regeneration in crush models of peripheral nerve injury, but no prior studies have been conducted on nerve transection, a surgical emergency that can lead to permanent weakness or paralysis. Acute sciatic nerve injuries were performed microsurgically to produce multiple grades of nerve transection in rats that were harvested 1 hour after surgery. High-resolution diffusion tensor images from ex vivo sciatic nerves were obtained using diffusion-weighted spin-echo acquisitions at 4.7 T. Fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced at the injury sites of transected rats compared with sham rats. Additionally, minor eigenvalues and radial diffusivity were profoundly elevated at all injury sites and were negatively correlated to the degree of injury. Diffusion tensor tractography showed discontinuities at all injury sites and significantly reduced continuous tract counts. These findings demonstrate that high-resolution DTI is a promising tool for acute diagnosis and grading of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries.

N2  - OBJECT The majority of growing and/or symptomatic peripheral nerve tumors are schwannomas and neurofibromas. They are almost always benign and can usually be resected while minimizing motor and sensory deficits if approached with the proper expertise and techniques. Intraoperative electrophysiological stimulation and recording techniques allow the surgeon to map the surface of the tumor in an effort to identify and thus avoid damaging functioning nerve fibers. Recently, MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques have permitted the visualization of axons, because of their anisotropic properties, in peripheral nerves. The object of this study was to compare the distribution of nerve fibers as revealed by direct electrical stimulation with that seen on preoperative MR DTI. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with a peripheral nerve or nerve root tumor between March 2012 and January 2014. Diffusion tensor imaging and intraoperative data had been prospectively collected for patients with peripheral nerve tumors that were resected. Preoperative identification of the nerve fiber location in relation to the nerve tumor surface as seen on DTI studies was compared with the nerve fiber's intraoperative localization using electrophysiological stimulation and recordings. RESULTS In 23 patients eligible for study there was good correlation between nerve fiber location on DTI and its anatomical location seen intraoperatively. Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated the relationship of nerve fibers relative to the tumor with 95.7% sensitivity, 66.7% specificity, 75% positive predictive value, and 93.8% negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative DTI techniques are useful in helping the peripheral nerve surgeon to both determine the risks involved in resecting a nerve tumor and plan the safest surgical approach.

N2  - Successful management of peripheral nerve trauma relies on accurate localization of the injury and grading of the severity of nerve injury to determine whether surgical intervention is required. Existing techniques, such as electrodiagnostic studies and conventional imaging modalities, provide important information, but are limited by being unable to distinguish severe nerve lesions in continuity that will recover from those that will not. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of peripheral nerves provide a novel technique to localize and grade nerve injury, by assessing the integrity of the nerve fibers across the site of nerve injury. Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography also hold promise as markers of early nerve regeneration, prior to clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of recovery. In the present review, the techniques of peripheral nerve DTI and tractography are discussed with respect to peripheral nerve trauma, with illustrative cases demonstrating potential roles of these novel approaches.

N2  - The diagnostic workup and surgical therapy for peripheral nerve tumors and tumorlike lesions are challenging. Magnetic resonance imaging is the standard diagnostic tool in the preoperative workup. However, even with advanced pulse sequences such as diffusion tensor imaging for MR neurography, the ability to differentiate tumor entities based on histological features remains limited. In particular, rare tumor entities different from schwannomas and neurofibromas are difficult to anticipate before surgical exploration and histological confirmation. High-resolution ultrasound (HRU) has become another important tool in the preoperative evaluation of peripheral nerves. Ongoing software and technical developments with transducers of up to 17-18 MHz enable high spatial resolution with tissue-differentiating properties. Unfortunately, high-frequency ultrasound provides low tissue penetration. The authors developed a setting in which intraoperative HRU was used and in which the direct sterile contact between the ultrasound transducer and the surgically exposed nerve pathology was enabled to increase structural resolution and contrast. In a case-guided fashion, the authors report the sonographic characteristics of rare tumor entities shown by intraoperative HRU and contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

N2  - OBJECT Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) are uncommon but bear a significant risk of malignancy. High-resolution MRI is the standard technique for characterizing PNSTs. However, planning the appropriate extent of resection and subsequent reconstructive strategies is highly dependent on the intraoperative findings because preoperative MRI evaluation can be insufficient. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) represents a recently developed advanced MRI technique that reveals the microstructure of tissues based on monitoring the random movement of water molecules. DTT has the potential to provide diagnostic insights beyond conventional MRI techniques due to its mapping of specific fibrillar nerve structures. Here, DTT was applied to evaluate PNSTs and to examine the usefulness of this method for the correct delineation of tumor and healthy nerve tissue and the value of this information in the preoperative planning of surgical interventions. METHODS In this prospective study, patients with the clinical symptoms of a PNST were investigated using DTT 3-Tesla MRI scans. Image data processing and tractography were performed using the FACT (fiber assessment by continuous tracking) algorithm and multiple-regions-of-interest approach. The surgical findings were then compared with the results of the DTT MRI scans. Preoperative fascicle visualization and the correlation with the intraoperative findings were graded. RESULTS In a 21-month period, 12 patients with PNSTs were investigated (7 female and 5 male patients with a mean age of 46.2 +/- 19.2 years). All patients underwent surgical removal of the tumor. Schwannoma was the most common benign histopathological finding (n = 7), whereas 2 malignant lesions were detected. In 10 of 12 patients, good preoperative nerve fascicle visualization was achieved using DTT scans. In 9 of 10 patients with good preoperative fascicle visualization, good intraoperative correlation between the DTT scans and surgical anatomy was found. CONCLUSIONS DTT properly visualizes the peripheral nerve fascicles and their correct anatomical relation to PNST. DTT represents a promising new method for the preinterventional planning of nerve tumor resection.

N2  - Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is hallmarked by degeneration of small unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers in the skin. Traditionally, it has been considered as a pure disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, previous work found that dysfunction of skin nerves led to abnormal recruitment of pain-related regions, suggesting that the brain may be affected in SFN. This report combined structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify structural and functional changes in the brain of 19 patients with SFN compared with 17 healthy controls. We applied tensor-based morphometry to detect brain structural alterations in SFN. Greater volume reduction in pain-processing regions, particularly the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices (ACCs), was associated with greater depletion of intraepidermal nerve fibers, a pathological biomarker of skin nerve degeneration. Based on the hypothesis that structural alterations in the pain-processing regions might impair their functional connectivity, we further applied psychophysiological interaction analysis to assess functional connectivity of the ACCs during noxious heat stimulation. There was significant reduction in functional connectivity from the ACCs to the limbic areas (the parahippocampal gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex), pain-processing area (the insula), and visuospatial areas (the cuneus). Moreover, the degree of reduction in functional connectivity for the ACC to the amygdala and the precuneus was linearly correlated with the severity of intraepidermal nerve fiber depletion. Our findings suggest that SFN is not a pure peripheral nervous system disorder. The pain-related brain networks tend to break into functionally independent components, with severity linked to the degree of skin nerve degeneration.

N2  - Growing evidence indicates that alterations within the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are involved at an early stage in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenetic cascade. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neurophysiologic analyses, and histologic analyses were used to monitor the extent of PNS damage in the hSOD-1 ALS rat model. The imaging signature of the disease was defined using in vivo MRI of the sciatic nerve. Initial abnormalities were detected in the nerves by an increase in T2 relaxation time before the onset of clinical disease; diffusion MRI showed a progressive increase in mean and radial diffusivity and reduction of fractional anisotropy at advanced stages of disease. Histologic analysis demonstrated early impairment of the blood-nerve barrier followed by acute axonal degeneration associated with endoneurial edema and macrophage response in motor nerve compartments. Progressive axonal degeneration and motor nerve fiber loss correlated with MRI and neurophysiologic changes. These functional and morphologic investigations of the PNS might be applied in following disease progression in preclinical therapeutic studies. This study establishes the PNS signature in this rat ALS model (shedding new light into pathogenesis) and provides a rationale for translating into future systematic MRI studies of PNS involvement in patients with ALS.

N2  - Objective: The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a novel magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) MRI assay of the proximal sciatic nerve (SN), which is inaccessible via current tools for assessing peripheral nerves, and (2) to evaluate the resulting MTR values as a potential biomarker of myelin content changes in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases. Method(s): MTR was measured in the SN of patients with CMT type 1A (CMT1A, n = 10), CMT type 2A (CMT2A, n = 3), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (n = 3), and healthy controls (n = 21). Additional patients without a genetically confirmed subtype (n = 4), but whose family histories and electrophysiologic tests were consistent with CMT, were also included. The relationship between MTR and clinical neuropathy scores was assessed, and the interscan and inter-rater reliability of MTR was estimated. Result(s): Mean volumetric MTR values were significantly decreased in the SN of patients with CMT1A (33.8 +/- 3.3 percent units) and CMT2A (31.5 +/- 1.9 percent units) relative to controls (37.2 6 2.3 percent units). A significant relationship between MTR and disability scores was also detected (p = 0.01 for genetically confirmed patients only, p = 0.04 for all patients). From interscan and inter-rater reliability analyses, proximal nerve MTR values were repeatable at the slicewise and mean volumetric levels. Conclusion(s): MTR measurements may be a viable biomarker of proximal nerve pathology in patients with CMT.Copyright © 2014 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Recent developments in the field of peripheral nerve imaging extend the capabilities of imaging modalities to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with peripheral nerve maladies. Methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its derivative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), ultrasound (US) and positron emission tomography (PET) are capable of assessing nerve structure and function following injury and relating the state of the nerve to electrophysiological and histological analysis. Of the imaging methods surveyed here, each offered unique and interesting advantages related to the field. MRI offered the opportunity to visualize immune activity on the injured nerve throughout the course of the regeneration process, and DTI offered numerical characterization of the injury and the ability to develop statistical bases for diagnosing injury. US extends imaging to the treatment phase by enabling more precise analgesic applications following surgery, and PET represents a novel method of assessing nerve injury through analysis of relative metabolism rates in injured and healthy tissue. Exciting new possibilities to enhance and extend the abilities of imaging methods are also discussed, including innovative contrast agents, some of which enable multimodal imaging approaches and present opportunities for treatment application.Copyright © 2015 S.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alternative use of molecular approaches is promising for improving nerve regeneration in surgical repair of neurotmesis. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of MR imaging in assessment of the enhanced nerve regeneration with toll-like receptor 4 signaling activation in surgical repair of neurotmesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight healthy rats in which the sciatic nerve was surgically transected followed by immediate surgical coaptation received intraperitoneal injection of toll-like receptor 4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (n = 24, study group) or phosphate buffered saline (n = 24, control group) until postoperative day 7. Sequential T2 measurements and gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and sciatic functional index were obtained over an 8-week follow-up period, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and gadofluorine enhancement of the distal nerve stumps were measured and compared between nerves treated with lipopolysaccharide and those treated with phosphate buffered saline. RESULT(S): Nerves treated with lipopolysaccharide injection achieved better functional recovery and showed more prominent gadofluorine enhancement and prolonged T2 values during the degenerative phase compared with nerves treated with phosphate buffered saline. T2 values in nerves treated with lipopolysaccharide showed a more rapid return to baseline level than did gadofluorine enhancement. Histology exhibited more macrophage recruitment, faster myelin debris clearance, and more pronounced nerve regeneration in nerves treated with toll-like receptor 4 activation. CONCLUSION(S): The enhanced nerve repair with toll-like receptor 4 activation in surgical repair of neurotmesis can be monitored by using gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and T2 relaxation time measurements. T2 relaxation time seems more sensitive than gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging for detecting such improved nerve regeneration.

N2  - Purpose To implement high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for visualization and quantification of peripheral nerves in human forearm. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all the study participants. Images were acquired with T1-and T 2-weighted turbo spin echo with/without fat saturation, short tau inversion recovery (STIR). In addition, high spatial resolution (1.0x1.0x3.0 mm3) DTI sequence was optimized for clearly visualizing ulnar, superficial radial and median nerves in the forearm. Maps of the DTI derived indices, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity (lambda//) and radial diffusivity (lambda) were generated. Results For the first time, the three peripheral nerves, ulnar, superficial radial, and median, were visualized unequivocally on high resolution DTI-derived maps. DTI delineated the forearm nerves more clearly than other sequences. Significant differences in the DTI-derived measures, FA, MD, lambda// and lambda , were observed among the three nerves. A strong correlation between the nerve size derived from FA map and T2-weighted images was observed. Conclusion High spatial resolution DTI is superior in identifying and quantifying the median, ulnar, and superficial radial nerves in human forearm. Consistent visualization of small nerves and nerve branches is possible with high spatial resolution DTI these normative data could potentially help in identifying pathology in diseased nerves.

N2  - MR microneurography is a noninvasive technique that provides visualization of the microanatomy of peripheral nerves, otherwise available only with histopathology. The objective of this study was to present a protocol to visualize the microstructure of peripheral nerves in vivo, using a 3T MRI scanner with a clinical set of coils and sequences. The tibial and the common peroneal nerves of healthy volunteers were imaged above the medial malleolus and at the level of the fibular head, respectively. The acquired images provided details about the internal structure of peripheral nerves, with visualization of the fascicles, the interfascicular fat, the epineurium, and the perineurium. MR microneurography can be performed in a clinical setting with acceptable imaging times and can be a potentially powerful tool that complements standard MR neurography.Copyright © 2014 Paolo F.

N2  - OBJECTIVE Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) has hitherto been considered a disease of the peripheral nervous system only, with central nervous system (CNS) involvement largely overlooked. The aim of this study was to investigate any differences in brain structure in subjects with DPN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Thirty-six subjects with type 1 diabetes (No DPN [n = 18], Painful DPN [n = 9], Painless DPN [n = 9]) underwent neurophysiological assessment to quantify the severity of DPN. All subjects, including 18 healthy volunteers (HVs), underwent volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. RESULTS Adjusted peripheral gray matter volume was statistically significantly lower in subjects with painless and painful DPN (mean 599.6 mL [SEM 9.8 mL] and 585.4 mL [10.0 mL], respectively) compared with those with No DPN (626.5 mL [5.7 mL]) and HVs (639.9 mL [7.2 mL]; ANCOVA, P = 0.001). The difference in adjusted peripheral gray matter volume between subjects with No DPN and HVs and those with Painful DPN and Painless DPN was not statistically significant (P = 0.16 and 0.30, respectively). Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed greater localized volume loss in the primary somatosensory cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and cingulate cortex (corrected P > 0.05) in DPN subjects. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to focus on structural changes in the brain associated with DPN. Our findings suggest increased peripheral graymatter volume loss, localized to regions involvedwith somatosensory perception in subjectswith DPN. Thismay have important implications for the long-term prognosis of DPN. © 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for pathologies of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) through clinical, electrophysiological and morphological evaluation of the median nerve. Method(s): The present work was a multilevel prospective study involving 30 subjects, 15 of whom had carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and 15 healthy controls. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation through administration of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), electroneurography (ENG), 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging with DTI, and calculation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at the flexor retinaculum. Tractography was also performed for three-dimensional reconstruction of the route of the median nerve through the carpal tunnel. The degree of functional impairment was compared with the anatomical damage to the median nerve according to ENG and DTI. Result(s): FA and ADC were significantly correlated with ENG parameters of CTS and BCTQ data. Mean FA and ADC values in the CTS patients were 0.359+/-0.06 and 1.866+/-0.050x10-3mm2/s, respectively, vs 0.59+/-0.014 and 1.395+/-0.035x10-3mm2/s, respectively, in the controls. FA was decreased and ADC increased in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): DTI parameters were clearly confirmed by both clinical and ENG data and, therefore, may be used for the diagnosis of CTS. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Objective: To analyse pelvic autonomous innervation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in comparison with anatomical macroscopic dissection on cadavers. Material(s) and Method(s): Pelvic MRI was performed in eight adult human cadavers (five men and three women) using a total of four sequences each: T1, T1 fat saturation, T2, diffusion weighed. Images were analysed with segmentation software in order to extract nervous tissue. Key height points of the pelvis autonomous innervation were located in every specimen. Standardised pelvis dissections were then performed. Distances between the same key points and the three anatomical references forming a coordinate system were measured on MRIs and dissections. Concordance (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient) between MRI and dissection was calculated. Result(s): MRI acquisition allowed an adequate visualization of the autonomous innervation. Comparison between 3D MRI images and dissection showed concordant pictures. The statistical analysis showed a mean difference of less than 1 cm between MRI and dissection measures and a correct concordance correlation coefficient on at least two coordinates for each point. Conclusion(s): Our acquisition and post-processing method demonstrated that MRI is suitable for detection of autonomous pelvic innervations and can offer a preoperative nerve cartography. * Nerve preservation is a hot topic in pelvic surgery * High resolution MRI can show distal peripheral nerves * Anatomo-radiological comparison shows good correlation between MRI and dissection * 3D reconstructions of pelvic innervation were obtained with an original method * This is a first step towards image-guided pelvic surgery. © 2014 European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Object. Extraspinal sciatica can present unique challenges in clinical diagnosis and management. In this study, the authors evaluated qualitative and quantitative patterns of sciatica-related pathology at the ischial tuberosity on MR neurography (MRN) studies performed for chronic extraspinal sciatica. Methods. Lumbosacral MRN studies obtained in 14 patients at the University of California, San Francisco between 2007 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients had been referred by neurosurgeons or neurologists for chronic unilateral sciatica (>= 3 months), and the MRN reports described asymmetrical increased T2 signal within the sciatic nerve at the level of the ischial tuberosity. MRN studies were also performed prospectively in 6 healthy volunteers. Sciatic nerve T2 signal intensity (SI) and cross-sectional area at the ischial tuberosity were calculated and compared between the 2 sides in all 20 subjects. The same measurements were also performed at the sciatic notch as an internal reference. Adjacent musculoskeletal pathology was compared between the 2 sides in all subjects. Results. Seven of the 9 patients for whom detailed histories were available had a specific history of injury or trauma near the proximal hamstring preceding the onset of sciatica. Eight of the 14 patients also demonstrated softtissue abnormalities adjacent to the proximal hamstring origin. The remaining 6 had normal muscles, tendons, and marrow in the region of the ischial tuberosity. There was a significant difference in sciatic nerve SI and size between the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides at the level of the ischial tuberosity, with a mean adjusted SI of 1.38 compared with 1.00 (p < 0.001) and a mean cross-sectional nerve area of 0.66 versus 0.54 cm2 (p = 0.002). The control group demonstrated symmetrical adjusted SI and sciatic nerve size. Conclusions. This study suggests that chronic sciatic neuropathy can be seen at the ischial tuberosity in the setting of prior proximal hamstring tendon injury or adjacent soft-tissue abnormalities. Because hamstring tendon injury as a cause of chronic sciatica remains a diagnosis of exclusion, this distinct category of patients has not been described in the radiographic literature and merits special attention from clinicians and radiologists in the management of extraspinal sciatica. Magnetic resonance neurography is useful for evaluating chronic sciatic neuropathy both qualitatively and quantitatively, particularly in patients for whom electromyography and traditional MRI studies are unrevealing. ©AANS, 2014.

N2  - Objective: We sought to determine lesion sites and spatial lesion patterns in spontaneous anterior interosseous nerve syndrome (AINS) with high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Method(s): In 20 patients with AINS and 20 age- and sex-matched controls, MRN of median nerve fascicles was performed at 3T with large longitudinal anatomical coverage (upper arm/elbow/ forearm): 135 contiguous axial slices (T2-weighted: echo time/repetition time 52/7,020 ms, time of acquisition: 15 minutes 48 seconds, in-plane resolution: 0.25 x 0.25 mm). Lesion classification was performed by visual inspection and by quantitative analysis of normalized T2 signal after segmentation of median nerve voxels. Result(s): In all patients and no controls, T2 lesions of individual fascicles were observed within upper arm median nerve trunk and strictly followed a somatotopic/internal topography: affected were those motor fascicles that will form the anterior interosseous nerve further distally while other fascicles were spared. Predominant lesion focus was at a mean distance of 14.6 +/- 5.4 cm proximal to the humeroradial joint. Discriminative power of quantitative T2 signal analysis and of qualitative lesion rating was high, with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity (p < 0.0001). Fascicular T2 lesion patterns were rated as multifocal (n = 17), monofocal (n = 2), or indeterminate (n = 1) by 2 independent observers with strong agreement (kappa = 0.83). Conclusion(s): It has been difficult to prove the existence of fascicular/partial nerve lesions in spontaneous neuropathies using clinical and electrophysiologic findings. With MRN, fascicular lesions with strict somatotopic organization were observed in upper arm median nerve trunks of patients with AINS. Our data strongly support that AINS in the majority of cases is not a surgically treatable entrapment neuropathy but a multifocal mononeuropathy selectively involving, within the main trunk of the median nerve, the motor fascicles that continue distally to form the anterior interosseous nerve.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to establish dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion in peripheral nerves for determination of blood-nerve permeability (K) and nerve blood volume (NBV) in peripheral neuropathies as compared with healthy controls. METHOD(S): The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Forty-three controls (24 women, 19 men; age, 48.7 +/- 17.5 years) and 59 patients with peripheral neuropathy (28 women, 31 men; age, 52.7 +/- 12.4 years) were examined by a standard protocol including a T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence (time of repetition/time of echo, 4.91/1.64; 10 slices; resolution 0.8 x 0.6 x 3.0 mm). Time - signal intensity analysis was performed by normalizing to pre-bolus arrival and calculating the mean contrast uptake (MCU) for each patient. Further analyses were performed by customized software to calculate K and NBV. Statistical analysis included 2-sided Student's t tests of controls versus patients, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and subgroup analysis of patients according to etiologies of neuropathy. RESULT(S): Time-signal intensity analysis showed significantly increased contrast uptake in patients as compared with controls (MCU, 1.29 +/- 0.15 vs 1.18 +/- 0.08; P < 0.001). This was caused mainly by an increase in K (0.046 +/- 0.025 vs 0.026 +/- 0.016 min; P < 0.001) and less by an increase in NBV (3.9 +/- 2.6 vs 3.0 +/- 1.9 mL/100 mL; P = 0.12). This trend was true for all etiologies except entrapment neuropathies. Excluding these, receiver operating characteristic analysis found an area under the curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.89) for MCU and 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.90) for K to discriminate neuropathy from control. CONCLUSION(S): Dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion is a feasible technique to assess K and NBV in peripheral nerves and may be used in future investigations on peripheral neuropathies. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - PURPOSE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the leading cause of death for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Identification of hypermetabolic lesions on PET may help identify patients at risk for MPNST. The objective of this study was to identify clinical and MRI-derived variables that predicted increased metabolic activity of neurofibromas in NF1 patients as determined by PET. METHOD(S): This prospective study included NF1 patients with neurofibromas of 5 cm in diameter or greater. All patients underwent whole-body MRI and F-FDG PET imaging. Tumor volume was calculated from the MR scans using a semiautomated 3-dimensional segmentation method. SUVmax's were calculated to quantify metabolic activity. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship among SUVmax, tumor volume, location (extremity vs trunk), type (plexiform vs circumscribed), depth (superficial vs deep), patient age, and whole-body tumor burden. RESULT(S): A total of 311 neurofibromas were identified in 19 NF1 patients (mean age, 38 years; range, 19-58 years). One extreme outlier was excluded from analysis. Whole-body tumor volumes ranged from 0.4 to 1182.4 mL. Fifty of 310 tumors were FDG-avid on PET (16%) with median SUVmax of 2.2 (range, 0.4-9.6). Metabolic activity (SUVmax >2.5) correlated with tumor location (deep > superficial, trunk > extremity) in tumors with PET avidity. CONCLUSION(S): In NF1 patients with neurofibromas of 5 cm or greater, the majority of internal tumors are not metabolically active on PET. Tumors with increased metabolic activity as defined by SUVmax greater than 2.5 (ie, suggestive of MPNST) are more likely to be deep and located within the trunk. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Background Prevalence of neurological dysfunction in a prospective cohort of patients newly diagnosed with coeliac disease is yet to be determined. The spectrum of neurological deficit in patients with this disease remains unclear. We aimed to establish the prevalence of neurological deficit in patients newly diagnosed with coeliac disease and to compare the clinicoradiological features of this group with patients presenting with neurological changes that eventually led to diagnosis of the disorder. Methods Patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease recruited from a tertiary referral gastrointestinal clinic at the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust were prospectively reviewed by a neurologist and underwent MRI of the brain. Clinicoradiological features of patients who presented with neurological dysfunction to a tertiary referral neurological clinic and who were subsequently diagnosed with coeliac disease were retrospectively reviewed. MRI biomarkers-cerebellar volume (percentage ratio of cerebellar volume to total intracranial volume [%CV:TIV]); N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio (NAA/Cr), a marker of neuronal health, measured with cerebellar proton MR spectroscopy; and voxel-based morphometry (VBM)-were analysed. Data were also compared with those of healthy volunteers who underwent the same MRI protocol and who were recruited from the local area. Regional ethics committee approved the study and all participants gave informed consent. Findings 30 patients (mean age 47 years, SD 16, range 23-77; 12 men) with newly diagnosed coeliac disease were recruited. 20 patients (61 years, 10, 42-74, nine men) diagnosed with coeliac disease after initially presenting with neurological dysfunction (neurological dysfunction group) were reviewed. MRI data were obtained from a register of 55 healthy volunteers (41 years, 15, 20-77; 32 men). 11 patients (37%) with newly diagnosed coeliac disease had neurological deficits on clinical examination, ten with mild gait ataxia and one with peripheral neuropathy. 16 patients (80%) in the neurological dysfunction group had gait ataxia (nine mild, six moderate, one severe); four patients had peripheral sensory neuropathy. %CV:TIV and NAA/Cr were significantly reduced in the neurological dysfunction group compared with patients with newly diagnosed disease (mean %CV:TIV 7.5 [SD 1.5] vs 8.5 [0.8], 95% CI 0.24-1.76; p=0.01 and NAA/Cr 0.85 [0.13] vs 0.95 [0.07], 0.04-0.17; p=0.004). %CV:TIV and NAA/Cr were also significantly lower in the neurological dysfunction group than in healthy volunteers (mean %CV:TIV 7.5 [SD 1.5] vs 8.4 [1.2], 95% CI 0.05-1.83; p=0.039 and NAA/Cr 0.85 [0.13] vs 0.98 [0.09], 0.05-0.20; p=0.001). There was no significant difference in %CV:TIV or NAA/Cr between patients newly diagnosed with coeliac disease and healthy volunteers. Patients in the neurological dysfunction group showed multiple regions of reduced grey matter density, especially of the cerebellum but also involving supratentorial regions (p<0.05) compared with healthy volunteers. Patients newly diagnosed with coeliac disaese showed only modest reduction in grey matter in the cingulate gyrus (p<0.05). Interpretation Our results might not be generalisable because data were obtained from a tertiary referral centre. Moreover, analysis of the neurological dysfunction subgroup was retrospective. Nonetheless, to our knowledge this is the first study to attempt to provide a prevalence of neurological dysfunction prospectively in patients with coeliac disease while also examining MRI biomarkers of brain dysfunction. This study seems to show that a significant proportion of patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms who are diagnosed with coeliac disease already have some neurological dysfunction. The group of patients that present with neurological dysfunction are more severely affected. Serological testing for the disease should be incorporated into the investigation of patients with unexplained neurological symptoms. Increased awareness of the spectrum of neurological dysfunction in coeliac disease and close collaboration between neurologists and gastroenterologists might increase detection and prevent unnecessary delay to dietary treatment, which could lead to permanent neurological disability.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS Diffusion tensor imaging is a specialized MRI that leverages tissue-specific differences in water diffusion to visualize neural structures. In the central nervous system, DTI has greatly impacted our abilities to map neural pathways in addition to serving as a diagnostic tool for traumatic injury. The use of DTI in the peripheral nervous system is limited, even though current clinical measurements of injured peripheral nerves are vastly insufficient for directing surgical decisions. Outcomes following peripheral nerve repair are currently unknown until late-stage clinical milestones are reached, which can be several months after the initial operation. In this study, we first evaluated DTI in an animal model of peripheral nerve injury and then initiated a human clinical trial for ulnar and median nerve injuries. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION Twelve Sprague Dawley rats were anesthetized and underwent partial or complete sciatic nerve transection followed by microsurgical repair. Rats were sacrificed at one hour postrepair and the injured nerves were excised and immersion-fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde/0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 24 hours. Images were acquired using a 2D diffusion-weighted spin echo sequence on a 4.7T MRI scanner. Additionally, two human subjects have been imaged to date, one normal and one injured subject, in a 3T MRI scanner. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS Rat DTI nerve tract counts in completely transected nerves (1.8 +/-0.92 tracts) were significantly lower than both partially transected (155.8 +/-45.5, p = 0.0136) and control nerves (199.7 +/-94.6, p = 0.0286). Human DTI nerve tracts were severely reduced in the median and ulnar nerves of the injured subject. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT Animal and human studies support the continued investigation of DTI for peripheral nerve injuries.

N2  - Objective: Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomiopathy (MNGIE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss of function mutations in the nuclear gene that encodes tymidine phosphorilase (TP). This leads to a marked reduction (or lack) of TP activity causing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects and respiratory chain dysfunction. MNGIE is characterized by severe gut dysmotility, along with neurological impairment, i.e. ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, peripheral neuropathy, and brain leukoencephalopathy (i.e. diffuse white matter - WM - changes) without cognitive deterioration. This study is aimed to elucidate the pathophysiology of leukoencephalopathy in MNGIE patients using advanced MR techniques, such asMR spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Method(s): Seven patients with a molecular diagnosis of MNGIE (3 F, 4 M; age range: 22-38 years) and 14 healthy controls (7 F and M, age range: 20-40 years) were studied using a 1.5 T GE scanner. Proton MRS was used to assess in brain WM concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), marker of neuronal and axonal integrity; creatine (Cr); and choline (Cho), component of membranes phospholipids. DTI was acquired to quantify several parameters of water molecules diffusion, such as mean diffusivity (MD). Group differences were calculated using the Student's t-test. Correlations were performed between 1H-MRS and DTI parameters, using the Pearson test one-tailed (p < 0.05). Result(s): In all patients a diffuse confluent cerebral leucoencephalopathy, often involving the sub-tentorial region, was detected. In patients WM [NAA], [Cr], and [Cho] were lower (p < 0.05) and WM MD higher (p < 0.05) vs controls. WM MD values were negatively correlated with WM [NAA] (p < 0.05). The reduction in all 1H -MRS metabolites in the brain WM of MINGIE patients can be explained by a dilution effectdue to increased brain water content demonstrated by the increased WM MD values. Conclusion(s): MNGIE patients showed a functional alteration of the blood brain barrier and absence of detectable brain axonal/neuronal loss, demyelination, and gliosis, thus supporting previous anatomopathological findings detected on some cases in a post-mortem analysis.The correlations between MRS and DTI changes suggest that MR parameters are robust biomarkers of disease, usable for monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.

N2  - Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has successfully been used to investigate ALS-related changes in the central nervous system (CNS). Many studies reported, for example, decreased white matter integrity in the corticospinal tract (CST). Consequently, DTI has been proposed as a potential biomarker to support clinical diagnosis. While recent results look promising in principle, the reliability of DTI-based diagnosis seems currently insufficient for practical use. To enhance discriminative performance, one would ideally integrate information from complementary diagnostic modalities during classifier construction. Objective(s): In a recent study, we observed ALS-related thinning of different peripheral nerves based on cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements using high-resolution ultrasound (1). Here, we combined DTI-based measures of the CST with CSA of the upper limb peripheral nerves to improve imagingbased discrimination between different ALS subtypes and healthy controls. Method(s): 51 patients with ALS (14 classic, 10 upper motor neuron dominant (UMND), 14 lower motor neuron dominant (LMND), 8 bulbar, and 5 primary lateral sclerosis (PLS)) and 18 healthy controls underwent diffusion-weighted MRI at 3T and peripheral nerve ultrasound in order to determine the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter underneath the motor cortex, posterior limb of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, pons and medulla oblongata as well as the CSA of the N. medianus and the N. ulnaris. Statistical comparisons were conducted using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Classifier construction was carried using linear discriminants after dimensionality reduction based on principal component analysis. Separate classifiers were constructed using FA, CSA, and both FA and CSA data, respectively. Result(s): Compared to controls, ALS patients exhibited significant, distally pronounced reductions of the ulnar nerve CSA across all subtypes with the exception of PLS. In addition, DTI data revealed significant differences between ALS subtypes with pronounced impairment of the CST in UMND and PLS and modest impairment in LMND patients. Classification performance was considerably higher exploiting both central and peripheral data compared to using either modality alone. Most notably, UMND and PLS patients could be accurately separated. Discussion and conclusion: Combining central and peripheral data acquired through DTI and ultrasound, respectively, leads to improved discrimination not only between ALS and healthy controls, but also between ALS subtypes. This speaks to the complementary role of both methods regarding their contribution to classification performance. The potential of combining both imaging methods is particularly evident in the reliable separation of UMND and PLS patients, since early differentiation of these subtypes remain a difficult problem in clinical practice.

N2  - Introduction: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are widely used in the evaluation of the central nervous system and recently have been reported as a potential tool for diagnosis of the peripheral nerve or the lumbar nerve entrapment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate consecutive changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of normal lumbar nerve roots from the junction of the dura mater. Method(s): The lumbar spinal nerves were examined in 6 male healthy volunteers (mean age, 35 years) with no experiences of sciatica, with a 3.0-T MR unit using a five-element phased-array surface coil. DTI was performed with the following imaging parameters: 11,084.6/ 73.7 ms for TR/TE; b-value, 800 s/mm2; MPG, 33 directions; slice thickness, 1.5 mm; and total scan time, 7 min 35 s. Mean FA and ADC values at all consecutive points along the L4, L5 and S1 nerves were quantified on every 1.5 mm slice from the junction of the dura mater with FT method, as follows: direct measurement of FA and ADC placing a region of interest (ROI) in expected axial DTI with fiber tracking (FT method). Result(s): ADC values of all L4, 5, and S1 nerve roots decreased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction and was constant distally afterward. ADC values in the proximal portion demonstrated S1>L5>L4 (p<0.05). On the other hand, FAvalues increased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction, and was constant distally afterward. FA values in the proximal portion showed L4>L5>S1 (p<0.05). Discussion(s): Our study demonstrated that ADC and FA values of each L4, 5, and S1 are differed, in the proximal part, it changed almost linearly, otherwise the distal part of far than 15 mmwas almost plateau. Although in the proximal part based on a ROI method, we think the influence of spinal fluid is not avoided. In measurement by the short fiber tracking which we used this time compared with measurement by ROI for every slice, it is thought that it is hard to be subject to the influence of spinal fluid, and it seems that it is useful catching a detail change of ADC and FA values by the distance of a nerve root. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated that ADC and FA values of each L4, 5, and S1 at the proximal portion from the junction of the dura matter changed linearly.

N2  - Background and aims: Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (Painful- DPN) is common and leads to considerable disability and a reduced quality of life. As there are no objective biomarkers of painful-DPN current treatments are less than optimal. Recent imaging studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have identified a network of brain structures that are active and connected during task-free paradigms, when the brain is at rest. This is called the default mode network (DMN). We therefore investigated the status of the DMN in painful DPN as a potential biomarker. Material(s) and Method(s): 51 patients with type 1 diabetes (No DPN, n=17; Painful DPN, n=17 and healthy volunteers [HV], n=17) underwent detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments. Rs-fMRI data were acquired at 3T (Achieva, Philips Healthcare) Blood oxygen level-dependent susceptibility- weighted dynamic datasets (n=100) were acquired over 225asec whilst the subject fixated on a visual cross. Data analysis were performed using independent components Analysis (ICA) with the FSL Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components (FSLMELODIC, FMRIB Oxford) tool and a previously validated dual-regression statistical approach. Result(s): Patients with painful DPN had increased functional connectivity in the DMN areas including the cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, medial frontal cortex and precuneus, when compared to no DPN and HV subjects (TFCE, uncorrected p<0.001). There was no difference in DMN functional connectivity between diabetic subjects with no DPN and HV. Conclusion(s): This preliminary study suggests abnormal functional connectivity in patients with painful DPN. These findings demonstrate that chronic pain has a widespread impact on overall brain function in diabetes, and suggest that disruptions of the DMN may underlie the cognitive and behavioral impairments accompanying chronic pain.

N2  - The diagnostic work-up of peripheral neuropathies largely depends on clinical and neurophysiological investigations. Recently, progress in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to new perspectives in the diagnostics of disorders of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Experimental data show how MR neurography visualises axonal and demyelinating lesions of the PNS, and additionally may demonstrate denervation of the affected muscle. In clinical use, difficult cases of focal nerve compression, traumatic or inflammatory lesions can be solved by the combination ofMR neurography and neurophysiology. In particular, the localisation of nerve lesions can precisely be determined by highresolution MR techniques, redefining previously described compression neuropathies. Furthermore, MR neurography enables new insights in the pathophysiology of neuropathies, as for instance in for diabetic polyneuropathy or hereditary disorders like neurofibromatosis or amyloidosis. Finally, new functional techniques as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or peripheral nerve perfusion measurements shed new light on the pathophysiology of peripheral nerve disorders. In this overview, the basis for imaging findings in MR-neurography will be highlighted and relevant clinical results will be summarized. Moreover, a perspective of future techniques and applications of MR-neurography will be presented.

N2  - Background: Breast cancer treatment with chemotherapy often results in neurotoxic sequelae including chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and cognitive dysfunction. Although CIPN and cognitive dysfunction are often viewed as separate phenomena, we hypothesized that these effects may be related. Method(s): Breast cancer patients treated with (Ctx+, n=27) and without (Ctx-, n=26) chemotherapy and healthy controls (HC, n=26) were assayed post-surgery, pre-treatment and one month post-treatment. All but one Ctx+ treatment included paclitaxel or docetaxel. Peripheral neuropathy symptom severity (PNS) was evaluated with the sum of the self-reported FACT/GOG-Ntx 11-item scale, cerebral gray matter density (GMD) and perfusion were assessed using MRI, and cognitive complaints, depression, and fatigue were assessed with the Multiple Ability Self-Report Questionnaire (MASQ), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, and the Fatigue Symptom Inventory. Result(s): Chemotherapy treatment was associated with increased PNS and cognitive complaints (p<0.01), which remained significant after adjusting for fatigue and depression. PNS was associated with increased cerebral perfusion in the left anterior cingulate (LAC) gyrus, a region associated with pain processing. Interestingly, a previously published Ctx+ frontal GMD decrease in this cohort was correlated with the LAC perfusion change (p<0.01) and PNS change (p<0.01). Individuals with GMD decrease showed lower LAC perfusion and fewer PNS, while increased PNS were correlated with increased cognitive complaints (p<0.05) and depression and fatigue (both p<0.01). Conclusion(s): This is the first study to identify cerebral perfusion change associated with peripheral neuropathy symptoms in a breast cancer cohort. Our findings suggest that chemotherapy-associated gray matter decrease may also reduce LAC perfusion and associated pain perception. This finding and the observed relationships between CIPN symptoms, depression, fatigue, and cognitive complaints highlight the importance of further research on the causal pathways underlying these effects, and of developing therapies targeting this symptom cluster.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of magnetization transfer (MT) MRI for assessing proximal nerve damage in inherited neuropathies.BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials have emphasized the need for novel biomarkers capable of assessing treatment response and disease progression in inherited neuropathies, especially in proximal nerves that are inaccessible via current techniques (e.g., electrophysiology, skin biopsy). Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) MRI has been shown to be sensitive to pathological changes in central nerves associated with myelin and/or axonal damage; however, no studies have evaluated MTR as a potential biomarker in peripheral nerves in vivo.DESIGN/METHODS: MRI was performed at 3.0 T (Philips Achieva) in twenty healthy volunteers (23-58 y.o.) and fifteen neuropathy patients from the following three cohorts: i) nine CMT1A patients (dysmyelinating CMT subtype, 28-56 y.o.); ii) two HNPP patients (dysmyelinating inherited neuropathy, 42-65 y.o.); and iii) four CMT2A patients (axonal CMT subtype, 26-57 y.o.). Fat-suppressed reference and MT-weighted data were collected from mid-thigh to the knee. The sciatic nerve (SN) was manually defined and slice-wise MTR values were calculated as MTR=(1-SMT/S0)*100%, where SMT and S0 are the MT-weighted and reference signal intensities. Clinical disability was assessed via clinical neuropathy scores. RESULT(S): From test-retest acquisitions (n=6), MTR values were found to be reproducible in the SN (p=0.70, paired t-test). The influence of BMI, age, and sex on MTR was insignificant in the healthy cohort (ANOVA, p>0.19). Mean MTR values were lower in CMT1A (35.2+/-3.0; p=0.07, t-test) and CMT2A (31.1+/-1.7%; p<0.01) patients compared to controls (37.1+/-2.3%). A significant relationship between MTR and neuropathy scores was also detected (p=0.03, Pearson,s correlation coefficient=-0.62). CONCLUSION(S): MTR, which is sensitive to myelin and axon pathologies, may be a viable biomarker for proximal nerve pathology in inherited neuropathies. We are currently enrolling additional patients to assess whether multi-parametric MRI (quantitative diffusion and MT) improves sensitivity and specificity over MTR measurements alone.

N2  - Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging is an emerging magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique for evaluating the microstructure of well-organized biologic tissues such as muscles and nerves. DT imaging provides information about tissue microstructure by producing three-dimensional maps of water molecule movements. The two main parameters of measurement at DT imaging, fractional anisotropy and the apparent diffusion coefficient, allow quantitation of architectural changes occurring in tissue. These parameters are modified in the presence of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, cervical spine trauma, carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar nerve compression, peripheral nerve tumors, and muscle ischemia. Their alteration may be observed at DT imaging even when no abnormality is seen at conventional MR imaging, a fact that suggests that DT imaging allows the detection of abnormalities at an earlier stage of injury. Experimental studies in animals have shown that DT imaging consistently allows identification of pathophysiologic alterations in tissue that correlate with histologic findings. Tractographic images accurately depict both normal and abnormal diffusion in anatomic structures such as the thigh and pelvic muscles, cervical spine, and lumbar nerves. Patients with chronic diseases also may benefit from follow-up evaluation with DT imaging, although DT imaging sequences must be further adapted to improve the evaluation of specific anatomic regions by reducing artifacts, optimizing spatial resolution, and minimizing acquisition time. Given its proven potential for use in identifying abnormalities that are otherwise identifiable only with electrophysiologic and histopathologic studies, and with future technical improvements, DT imaging could soon become a standard method for early diagnosis, management, and follow-up of disease in the spine, muscles, and peripheral nerves.Copyright RSNA, 2014

N2  - MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3.0 T by using proton density- and T2-weighted relaxometry and DTI on elbows in 30 healthy subjects without clinical evidence of neuropathy. Quantitative analysis of ulnar nerve T2 and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed, and T2 and FA values were correlated to electrical nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) with Pearson correlation analysis. Additional qualitative assessment of T2-weighted and FA images was performed by two readers, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated., PURPOSE: To investigate the ability of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 to help detect the mildest nerve lesion conceivable, that is, subclinical ulnar neuropathy at the elbow., CONCLUSION: FA maps can accurately depict even mild peripheral neuropathy and perform better than the current standard of reference, T2-weighted images. DTI may therefore add diagnostic value as a highly sensitive technique for the detection of peripheral neuropathy., RESULTS: Ten of the 30 subjects (33%) had NCV slowing across the elbow segment. Compared with subjects without NCV slowing, subjects with slowing had decreased FA values (0.51 +/- 0.09 vs 0.41 +/- 0.07, respectively; P = .006) and increased T2 values (64.2 msec +/- 10.9 vs 76.2 msec +/- 13.7, respectively; P = .01) in the proximal ulnar sulcus. FA values showed a significant correlation (P = .01) with NCV slowing over the sulcus as an electrophysiologic indicator of myelin sheath damage. Qualitative assessment of FA maps and T2-weighted images helped identify subjects with conduction slowing with a sensitivity of 80% and 55%, respectively, and a specificity of 83% and 63%.Copyright © RSNA, 2014.

T1  - Ultra-fast steady state free precession and its application to in vivo 1H morphological and functional lung imaging at 1.5 tesla
A1  - Bieri, Oliver 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Purpose The speed limit for three-dimensional Fourier-encoded steady state free precession (SSFP) imaging is explored on a clinical whole body system and pushed toward a pulse repetition time (TR) close to or even below the 1 ms regime; in the following referred to as ultra-fast SSFP imaging. Methods To this end, contemporary optimization strategies, such as efficient gradient switching patterns, partial echoes, ramp sampling techniques, and a target-related design of excitation pulses were applied to explore the lower boundaries in TR for SSFP-based Cartesian imaging. Results Generally, minimal TR was limited in vivo by peripheral nerve stimulation, allowing a TR ~1 ms for isotropic resolutions down to about 2 mm. As a result, ultra-fast balanced SSFP provides artifact-free images even for targets with severe susceptibility variations, and native high-resolution structural and functional in vivo 1H imaging of the human lung is demonstrated at 1.5 T. Conclusion On clinical whole body MRI systems, the TR of SSFP-based Cartesian imaging can be pushed toward the 1 ms regime. As a result, ultra-fast SSFP protocols might represent a promising new powerful approach for SSFP-based imaging, not only for lung but also in a variety of clinical and scientific applications.

N2  - Objective To prospectively evaluate the usefulness of a newly developed high-resolution three-dimensional diffusion-weighted imaging method, turbo field-echo with diffusion-sensitized driven-equilibrium (TFE-DSDE) in diagnosing middle-ear cholesteatoma by comparing it to conventional single-shot echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (SS-EP DWI). Materials and methods Institutional review board approval and informed consent from all participants were obtained. We studied 30 patients with preoperatively suspected acquired cholesteatoma. Each patient underwent an MR examination including both SS-EP DWI and DSDE-TFE using a 3.0 T MR scanner. Images of the 30 patients (60 temporal bones including 30 with and 30 without cholesteatoma) were reviewed by two independent neuroradiologists. The confidence level for the presence of cholesteatoma was graded on a scale of 0-2 (0 = definite absence, 1 = equivocal, 2 = definite presence). Interobserver agreement as well as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detection were assessed for the two reviewers. Results Excellent interobserver agreement was shown for TFE-DSDE (kappa = 0.821) whereas fair agreement was obtained for SS-EP DWI (kappa = 0.416). TFE-DSDE was associated with significantly higher sensitivity (83.3%) and accuracy (90.0%) compared to SS-EP DWI (sensitivity = 35.0%, accuracy = 66.7%; p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in specificity (96.7% for TFE-DSDE, 98.3% for SS-EP DWI) Conclusion With increased spatial resolution and reduced susceptibility artifacts, TFE-DSDE improves the accuracy in diagnosing acquired middle ear cholesteatomas compared to SS-EP DWI. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Aims/hypothesis: Longstanding diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the risk of complications affecting the central nervous system. The aims were to study brain volume and cortical thickness in regional brain areas in DM patients and to correlate the findings with relevant clinical data. Method(s): 15 patients with longstanding (average 24.6 years) type 1 DM and 20 healthy controls were studied in a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. Using an automated surface based cortical segmentation method, cortical thickness was assessed in anatomical regions including total and lobe-wise grey and white matter volumes. Also morphological changes were evaluated. Result(s): No differences between patients and controls were found in regard to number of white matter lesions (P=0.50), grey and white matter volumes (P=0.25) and overall cortical thickness (P=0.64). Subanalysis revealed exclusively reduced cortical thickness of the postcentral (P=0.03) and superior parietal gyrus (P=0.008) in patients. The cortical thickness of these regions was not associated with diabetes duration, age at diabetes onset or to HbA1c (all P>0.08). Patients with peripheral neuropathy showed reduced right postcentral gyrus cortical thickness compared to patients without peripheral neuropathy (P=0.02). Conclusion(s): Patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed cortical thinning involving sensory related areas, even though no overall macrostructural brain alterations were detected. This could possibly have underlying functional significance since cortical thinning was associated to presence of peripheral neuropathy. The absence of universal macrostructural changes might illustrate that more pronounced brain pathology is likely to be preceded by more subtle microstructural changes as reported in other studies. © J.

T1  - Therapeutic drug approach to stimulate clinical recovery after brain injury
T2  - Frontiers of Neurology and Neuroscience
A1  - Krieger, Derk W. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - The identification of strategies by which the central nervous system (CNS) can transform itself in response to injury has incited the systematic exploration of methods to enhance neurological recovery after CNS injury. Several pharmaceuticals have been shown to promote such recovery; however, more rigorous clinical trials are necessary to establish their clinical relevance. The major impediment for these strategies in the clinical arena is the astounding heterogeneity surrounding neuroplasticity and regeneration. Tolerance to injury and varied rates of recovery are likely governed by genetic and environmental factors that remain largely elusive. The extraordinary complexity of the neural networks in the CNS impedes the assessment of 'plain' pharmacological interventions in therapeutic trials. 'Proof-of-principle' studies of pharmacological interventions enhancing neuroplasticity or regeneration may therefore at first focus on surrogate markers, such as functional MRI, magnetoencephalography and diffusion tensor imaging, or investigate seemingly more uniform systems, such as spinal cord injuries. The discovery that experimental adult CNS lesions can essentially regenerate has rejected the conviction that adult axon injury is always permanent and spurred research into determining whether the circumstances under which such regeneration occurs can be created in human CNS injury. The hostility of the microenvironment preventing axonal regrowth has been linked to key molecular targets involving myelin-associated factors and glial scar components. While the mechanisms involved are better understood now and potential therapeutic targets are identified, the crucial question whether manipulating the molecular regulation of axonal repair is feasible and will benefit patients remains uncertain. While factual repair of brain tissue may still be years away, research into the mechanisms of adaptation after brain injury offers more tangible return on the short run.Copyright © 2013 S.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A number of benign and malignant peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions produce similar imaging features on conventional anatomic MR imaging. Functional MR imaging using DTI can increment the diagnostic performance in differentiation of these lesions. Our aim was to evaluate the role of 3T anatomic MR imaging and DTI in the characterization of peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (13 men, 16 women; mean age, 41+/-18 years; range, 11- 83 years) with a nerve tumor or tumorlike condition (25 benign, 5 malignant) underwent 3T MR imaging by using anatomic (n=29), functional diffusion, DWI (n=21), and DTI (n=24) techniques. Images were evaluated for image quality (3-point scale), ADC of the lesion, tractography, and fractional anisotropy of nerves with interobserver reliability in ADC and FA measurements. RESULT(S): Nosignificant differences were observed in age (benign, 40+/-18 versus malignant, 45+/-19 years) and sex (benign, male/female= 12:12 versus malignant, male/female=3:2) (P>.05). All anatomic (29/29, 100%)MRimaging studies received 'good' quality; 20/21 (95%) DWI and 21/24 (79%) DTI studies received 'good' quality. ADC of benign lesions (1.848 +/- 0.40 x 10-3 mm2/s) differed from that of malignant lesions (0.900 +/- 0.25 x 10-3 mm2/s, P < .001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.988 [95% CI, 0.976-0.994]). There were no FA or ADC differences between men and women (P>.05). FA of involved nerves was lower than that in contralateral healthy nerves (P< .001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.970 [95% CI, 0.946-0.991]). ADC on DTI and DWI was not statistically different (P > .05), with excellent intermethod reliability (ICC = 0.943 [95% CI, 0.836-0.980]). Tractography differences were observed in benign and malignant lesions. CONCLUSION(S): 3T MR imaging and DTI are valuable methods for anatomic and functional evaluation of peripheral nerve lesions with excellent interobserver reliability. While tractography and low FA provide insight into neural integrity, low diffusivity values indicate malignancy in neural masses.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate magnetization transfer (MT) effects as a new source of contrast for imaging and tracking of peripheral foot nerves. Material(s) and Method(s): Two sets of 3D spoiled gradient-echo images acquired with and without a saturation pulse were used to generate MT ratio (MTR) maps of 260 mum in-plane resolution for eight volunteers at 3T. Scan parameters were adjusted to minimize signal loss due to T2 dephasing, and a dedicated coil was used to improve the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio of small voxels. Resulting MTR values in foot nerves were compared with those in surrounding muscle tissue. Result(s): Average MTR values for muscle (45.5 +/- 1.4%) and nerve (21.4 +/- 3.1%) were significantly different (P < 0.0001). In general, the difference in MTR values was sufficiently large to allow for intensity-based segmentation and tracking of foot nerves in individual subjects. This procedure was termed MT-based 3D visualization. Conclusion(s): The MTR serves as a new source of contrast for imaging of peripheral foot nerves and provides a means for high spatial resolution tracking of these structures. The proposed methodology is directly applicable on standard clinical MR scanners and could be applied to systemic pathologies, such as diabetes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Neuroimaging in Mitochondrial Disorders
A1  - Gropman, Andrea L. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Summary: Mutations in either nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA can result in disruption of oxidative phosphorylation and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial disease manifestations occur predominantly in the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and/or involve several organ systems. The consequences range from manifestations of a single organ or tissues, such as muscle fatigue, if confined only to muscle, seizures, intellectual disabilities, dementia, and stroke (if to the central nervous system), leading to disability or even early death. The definitive diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder can be difficult to establish. Criteria and checklists have been established and are more reflective of adult disease. However, in children, when symptoms suggest a mitochondrial disease, neuroimaging features may have more diagnostic impact and additionally these can be used to follow the course, evolution, and recovery of the disease. This review will demonstrate the common neuroimaging patterns in patients with mitochondrial disorders and point out how various newer neuroimaging modalities may be exploited to glean information as to the different aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction or resulting neurological and cognitive disruption, although reports in the literature using these methods remain sparse. © 2012 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

N2  - Lower back pain is a common problem frequently encountered without specific biomarkers that correlate well with an individual patient's pain generators. MRI quantification of diffusion and T2 relaxation properties may provide novel insight into the mechanical and inflammatory changes that occur in the lumbosacral nerve roots in patients with lower back pain. Accurate imaging of the spinal nerve roots is difficult because of their small caliber and oblique course in all three planes. Two-dimensional in-plane imaging of the lumbosacral nerve roots requires oblique coronal imaging with large field of view (FOV) in both dimensions, resulting in severe geometric distortions using single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) techniques. The present work describes initial success using a reduced-FOV single-shot spin-echo EPI acquisition to obtain in-plane diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 mapping of the bilateral lumbar nerve roots at the L4 level of healthy subjects, minimizing partial volume effects, breathing artifacts and geometric distortions. A significant variation in DTI and T2 mapping metrics is also reported along the course of the normal nerve root. The fractional anisotropy is statistically significantly lower in the dorsal root ganglia (0.287+/-0.068) than in more distal regions in the spinal nerve (0.402+/-0.040) (p<10-5). The T2 relaxation value is statistically significantly higher in the dorsal root ganglia (78.0+/-11.9ms) than in more distal regions in the spinal nerve (59.5+/-7.4ms) (p<10-5). The quantification of nerve root DTI and T2 properties using the proposed methodology may identify the specific site of any degenerative and inflammatory changes along the nerve roots of patients with lower back pain. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Trigeminal neuralgia is a syndrome due to dysfunctional hyperactivity of the trigeminal nerve, and is characterized by a sudden, usually unilateral, recurrent lancinating pain arising from one or more divisions of the nerve. The most accepted pathogenetic mechanism for trigeminal neuralgia is compression of the nerve at its dorsal root entry zone or in its distal course. In this paper, we report four cases with trigeminal neuralgia due to an unknown mechanism after an intracranial intervention. The onset of trigeminal neuralgia after surgical interventions that are unrelated to the trigeminal nerve suggests that in patients with greater individual susceptibility, nerve contact with the vascular structure due to postoperative pressure and changes in cerebrospinal fluid flow may cause the onset of pain.

N2  - Chronic immune-mediated neuropathies show high clinical variability. Diagnosis is based on clinical and neurophysiological studies, but recently ultrasound (US) of peripheral nerves has been shown to provide useful morphological information. US has already been shown to crucially influence diagnosis and clinical care in entrapment neuropathies, in traumatic nerve lesions and in tumors. The role of US in the evaluation of polyneuropathies is still not clearly defined, but increasing attention has recently been focused on the immune-mediated neuropathies and specific US measures (namely the intra- and inter-nerve cross-sectional area variability) have been developed. The aim of the current paper is to make a review of the available nerve US studies and provide data from personal observations in the most common chronic immune-mediated neuropathies. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Background and purpose: The autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the SACS gene. The disease, first described in Canadian families from Quebec, is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract involvement and peripheral neuropathy. Method(s): Analysis of SACS gene allowed the identification of 14 patients with ARSACS from 13 unrelated Italian families. Clinical phenotype, gene mutations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were analysed. Result(s): We found 16 novel SACS gene mutations, including a large in-frame deletion. The age at onset was in infancy, but one patient presented the first symptoms at age 32. Progression of the disease was variable, and increased muscle tone was mostly recognized in later stages. Structural MRI showed atrophy of the superior cerebellar vermis, a bulky pons exhibiting T2-hypointense stripes, identified as the corticospinal tract (CST), thinning of the corpus callosum and a rim of T2-hyperintensity around the thalami in 100% of cases. The presence of iron or other paramagnetic substances was excluded. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed grossly over-represented transverse pontine fibres (TPF), which prevented reconstruction of the CST at this level (100% of cases). In all patients, significant microstructural alterations were found in the supratentorial white matter of forceps, cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Conclusion(s): Our findings further enlarge the genetic spectrum of SACS mutations and widen the study of clinical phenotype. MRI characteristics indicate that pontine changes and supratentorial abnormalities are diagnostic. The over-representation of TPF on DTI suggests a developmental component in the pathogenesis of the disease. © 2012 The Author(s) European Journal of Neurology © 2012 EFNS.

T1  - Central mechanisms of pain revealed through functional and structural MRI
A1  - Davis, Karen D.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - MR-based brain imaging technologies provide a suite of functional and structural metrics that can be used to test hypotheses about the CNS mechanisms underlying pain perception and chronification, from a cellular level to a systems level. Two types of functional MRI discussed in this review provide insight into pain mechanisms: stimulus-evoked fMRI and task-free ("resting state") fMRI. The former can assess how the brain responds to noxious or non-noxious stimuli normally or in a chronic pain state as a window into understanding pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. The latter can assess functional connectivity reflecting synchronous ultra-slow frequency oscillation between brain areas. This provides insight into how brain areas work together as networks to produce pain and how these networks may be modified due to chronic pain. Perfusion MR (e.g., arterial spin labeling) can also provide task-free information pertaining to ongoing brain activity that may reflect spontaneous (ongoing) chronic pain. Structural MR techniques can be used to delineate gray and white matter abnormalities and markers of neuroinflammation associated with chronic pains. Functional and structural MRI findings point to brain and peripheral nerve abnormalities in patients with chronic pain, some of which are pre-existing and others that develop with prolonged pain (and related neuroinflammation) over time. Recent studies indicate that some structural brain abnormalities associated with chronic pain are reversible following effective pain treatment. These data together with findings from studies of individual differences suggest that some chronic pains arise from a combination of pre-existing vulnerabilities and sustained abnormal input. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Objective Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common median nerve entrapment neuropathy characterized by pain, paresthesias, diminished peripheral nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and maladaptive functional brain neuroplasticity. We evaluated structural reorganization in brain gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) and whether such plasticity is linked to altered median nerve function in CTS. Methods We performed NCV testing, T1-weighted structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 28 CTS and 28 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) contrasted regional GM volume for CTS versus HC. Significant clusters were correlated with clinical metrics and served as seeds to define associated WM tracts using DTI data and probabilistic tractography. Within these WM tracts, fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity were evaluated for group differences and correlations with clinical metrics. Results For CTS subjects, GM volume was significantly reduced in contralesional S1 (hand-area), pulvinar and frontal pole. GM volume in contralesional S1 correlated with median NCV. NCV was also correlated with RD and was negatively correlated with FA within U-fiber cortico-cortical association tracts identified from the contralesional S1 VBM seed. Conclusions Our study identified clear morphometric changes in the CTS brain. This central morphometric change is likely secondary to peripheral nerve pathology and altered somatosensory afference. Enhanced axonal coherence and myelination within cortico-cortical tracts connecting primary somatosensory and motor areas may accompany peripheral nerve deafferentation. As structural plasticity was correlated with NCV and not symptomatology, the former may be a better determinant of appropriate clinical intervention for CTS, including surgery. © 2013 The Authors.

T1  - Proximal weakness due to injury of the corticoreticular pathway in a patient with traumatic brain injury
A1  -  
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The corticoreticular pathway (CRP) innervates the proximal muscles of extremities and axial muscles; therefore, it is involved in postural control and gait. We report on a patient who exhibited proximal weakness due to a CRP injury, which was evaluated using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). METHOD(S): A 62-year-old male patient who had been injured in a traffic accident underwent conservative management for a contusional hemorrhage in the right frontotemporal lobes, and a subdural and epidural hematoma in the right temporoparietal lobes. The patient exhibited right proximal weakness (shoulder: 3+, hip: 3+) at two weeks after onset. Findings on brain MRI revealed encephalomalactic lesions in both frontal lobes. RESULT(S): Findings on DTT of the left CRP showed discontinuation at the midbrain level; in contrast, the integrities of the corticospinal tract in both hemispheres were maintained from the cerebral cortex to the medulla along the known pathway of the corticospinal tract. CONCLUSION(S): The proximal weakness of the right shoulder and hip observed in this patient appeared to be attributed to injury of the left CRP. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Objective: To assess the agreement of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median nerve on 3.0 T MR scanners from different vendors. Material(s) and Method(s): IRB approved study including 16 healthy volunteers (9 women; mean age 30.6 +/- 5.3 years). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the dominant wrist was performed on three 3.0 T MR scanners (GE, Siemens, Philips) using similar imaging protocols and vendor-proprietary hard- and software. Intra-, inter-reader and inter-vendor agreements were assessed. Result(s): ICCs for intra-/inter-reader agreements ranged from 0.843-0.970/0.846-0.956 for FA, and 0.840-0.940/0.726-0.929 for ADC, respectively. ANOVA analysis identified significant differences for FA/ADC measurements among vendors (p < 0.001/p < 0.01, respectively). Overall mean values for FA were 0.63 (SD +/- 0.1) and 0.999 x 10 -3mm2/s (SD +/- 0.134 x 10-3) for ADC. A significant negative measurement bias was found for FA values from the GE scanner (-0.05 and -0.07) and for ADC values from the Siemens scanner (-0.053 and -0.063 x 10-3mm2/s) as compared to the remainder vendors Conclusion(s): FA and ADC values of the median nerve obtained on different 3.0 T MR scanners differ significantly, but are in comparison to the standard deviation of absolute values small enough to not have an impact on larger group studies or when substantial diffusion changes can be expected. However, caution is warranted in an individual patient when interpreting diffusion values from different scanner acquisitions. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Trigeminal neuralgia, painful trigeminal neuropathy, and painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are chronic orofacial pain conditions that are thought to have fundamentally different etiologies. Trigeminal neuralgia and neuropathy are thought to arise from damage to or pressure on the trigeminal nerve, whereas TMD results primarily from peripheral nociceptor activation. This study sought to assess the volume and microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in these 3 conditions. In 9 neuralgia, 18 neuropathy, 20 TMD, and 26 healthy controls, the trigeminal root entry zone was selected on high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and the volume (mm3) calculated. Additionally, using diffusion-tensor images (DTIs), the mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values of the trigeminal nerve root were calculated. Trigeminal neuralgia patients displayed a significant (47%) decrease in nerve volume but no change in DTI values. Conversely, trigeminal neuropathy subjects displayed a significant (40%) increase in nerve volume but again no change in DTI values. In contrast, TMD subjects displayed no change in volume or DTI values. The data suggest that the changes occurring within the trigeminal nerve are not uniform in all orofacial pain conditions. These structural and volume changes may have implications in diagnosis and management of different forms of chronic orofacial pain. Perspective(s): This study reveals that neuropathic orofacial pain conditions are associated with changes in trigeminal nerve volume, whereas non-neuropathic orofacial pain is not associated with any change in nerve volume. © 2013 by the American Pain Society.

N2  - Objectives: To assess the value of reduced field of view (rFOV) imaging in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of the lumbar nerve roots at 3 T from the perspective of future clinical trials. Method(s): DTI images of the lumbar nerves were obtained in eight healthy volunteers, with and without the rFOV technique. Non-coplanar excitation and refocusing pulses associated with outer volume suppression (OVS) were used to achieve rFOV imaging. Tractography was performed. A visual evaluation of image quality was made by two observers, both senior musculoskeletal radiologists. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured in L5 and S1 roots. Result(s): rFOV images of the L5 and S1 roots were assessed as being superior to full FOV (fFOV) images. Image quality was rated as good to excellent by both observers. Interobserver agreement was good. No significant difference was found in FA and ADC measurements of the L5 or S1 roots. On the contrary, only poor-quality images could be obtained with fFOV imaging as major artefacts were present. Conclusion(s): The rFOV approach was essential to achieve high-quality DTI imaging of lumbar nerve roots on 3-T MRI. Key Points: * Diffusion tensor 3-T MR imaging of lumbar nerve roots creates severe artefacts. * A reduced field of view drastically reduces artefacts, thereby improving image quality. * Good-quality tractography images can even be obtained with rFOV imaging. * rFOV DTI is better than fFOV DTI for clinical studies. © 2012 European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Objectives: To investigate median nerve structure in patients with recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to relate DTI changes to anatomical MRI and to measures of median nerve function. Method(s): Median nerve structure was quantified according to DTI in patients with recurrent CTS and in healthy controls of similar age. Anatomical MRI was used to identify the presence of nerve compression and fibrosis. Median nerve function was measured using electromyography, a force-tracking task (accuracy of precision grip control) and clinical measures. Result(s): Patients showed reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), reduced axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) along the median nerve compared with controls (P < 0.001). Patients with endoneural fibrosis had the greatest reductions in ADC and in RD. ADC and AD correlated positively with nerve conduction velocity (R = 0.54 and R = 0.68, respectively) and fractional anisotropy correlated negatively with error during force-tracking (R = -0.58). Conclusion(s): A specific pattern of DTI changes in the median nerve was identified in patients with recurrent CTS. Fibrosis may be underlying these structural changes. The correlations with nerve conduction velocity and accuracy of force control suggest that DTI is a promising technique in the study of median nerve structure in recurrent CTS. © 2013 European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Tuberculosis is among the oldest and most devastating infectious diseases worldwide. Nearly one third of the world's population has active or latent disease, resulting in 1.5 million deaths annually. Central nervous system involvement, while rare, is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Manifestations include tuberculoma and tuberculous meningitis, with the majority of cases occurring in children and immunocompromised patients. Despite advancements in imaging and laboratory diagnostics, tuberculomas of the central nervous system remain a diagnostic challenge due to their insidious nature and nonspecific findings. On imaging studies tuberculous meningitis is characterized by diffuse basal enhancement, but tuberculomas may be indistinguishable from neoplasms. Early diagnosis is imperative, since clinical outcomes are largely dependent on timely treatment. Stereotactic biopsy with histopathological analysis can provide a definitive diagnosis, but is only recommended when non-invasive methods are inconclusive. Standard medical treatment includes rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin or ethambutol. In cases of drug resistance, revision of the treatment regimen with second-line agents is recommended over the addition of a single drug to the first-line regimen. Advances in genomics have identified virulent strains of tuberculosis and are improving our understanding of host susceptibility. Neurosurgical referral is advised for patients with elevated intracranial pressure, seizures, or brain or spinal cord compression. This review synthesizes pertinent findings in the literature surrounding central nervous system tuberculoma in an effort to highlight recent advances in pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) are autosomal recessive ataxias caused by mutations in genes involved in maintaining DNA integrity. Lifespan in AT is greatly shortened (20s-30s) due to increased susceptibility to malignancies (leukemia/lymphoma). Lifespan in AOA2 is uncertain. We describe a woman with variant AT with two novel mutations in ATM (IVS14 + 2 T > G and 5825C > T, p.A1942V) who died at age 48 with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Her mutations are associated with an unusually long life for AT and with a cancer rarely associated with that disease. We also describe two siblings with AOA2, heterozygous for two novel mutations in senataxin (3 bp deletion c.343-345 and 1398 T > G, p.I466M) who have survived into their 70s, allowing us to characterize the longitudinal course of AOA2. In contrast to AT, we show that persons with AOA2 can experience a prolonged lifespan with considerable motor disability. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Introduction: Apprehension is the most frequent complaint of patients after traumatic anterior glenohumeral dislocations [1]. Also, some patients have persisting apprehension even after successful open or arthroscopic stabilization [2-5]. It is not always clear whether the origin of apprehension is true instability or whether it stems from a cerebral pattern linking a certain motion or position to a subjectively unpleasant sensation. Failure to recognize and adequately address this issue of persisting apprehension due to cerebral patterning may result in poor outcomes and even lead to unnecessary revision surgery. Furthermore, identifying this condition may allow establishing adequately targeted rehabilitation protocols. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool to assess neuronal activations during numerous situations. To date, no investigation has assessed the neuronal correlates of shoulder apprehension. Hypothesis: Apprehension is consecutive to brain activation and cerebral remodeling. Shoulder instability could lead to cerebral reorganization and thus, apprehension could persist even in the case of a mechanically stable glenohumeral joint. Therefore, in some cases, the sensation of apprehension could be linked to abnormal cerebral conditioning and not necessarily to persisting instability. Purpose of the study: The purpose of the study was to localize the zones of cerebral activation and to investigate neuronal activation patterns using event-related fMRI while the subjects are visualizing provocative videos depicting situations stimulating apprehensive reactions. Material(s) and Method(s): Multimodal neuroimaging including functional connectivity, grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) morphometry was used to assess the unexplored neuronal mechanism mediating shoulder apprehension. This prospective study included 7 consecutive right-handed male patients with right-sided shoulder apprehension (30.1 +/- 8.1 years) and 11 healthy male right-handed control participants. MR protocol: A video projector was used to project the stimuli onto a translucent screen mounted to the table of the MR imager. Stimuli were seen via mirrors on the head coil. Each run consisted of twelve movies evoking shoulder instability and twelve control movies. Multimodal analyses include functional connectivity tensorial independent component analysis during visual stimulation of movies showing typical apprehension movements versus control videos, voxel-based morphometry analysis of GM and tract-based spatial statistics analysis of WM. Result(s): Patients with shoulder apprehension had cerebral remodeling with significant (p <0.05 corrected) increase in functional connectivity notably in the ipsilateral motor area (Smode +151%, component 16) and less pronounced in anterior (Smode + 131%, component 19) and posterior (Smode + 41%, component 10) parts of the default mode network despite the absence of potentially confounding structural changes in GM or WM. Discussion(s): Shoulder instability is often associated with peripheral nerve injury. This is the first study that demonstrates that a peripheral orthopaedic pathology could also lead to a central neurological impairment. Shoulder apprehension induces functional reorganization of the brain with notably up-regulation of ipsilateral motor areas as well as alteration of the default mode network. This premier observation offers novel insights into the neuronal effects of shoulder instability which could, with future studies, be generalized to other joints. These original findings may open new horizons leading to improved management regimens for articular instability.

N2  - Background: Despite the fact that the loss of peripheral axons is a major cause of disability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor axons are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has not been extensively studied so far. Objective(s): To characterize in detail the natural history of the PNS damage in a hSOD-1G93A ALS rat model using both in vivo and ex vivo readouts and compare such results with histopathological findings in diagnostic motor nerve biopsies from ALS patients. Method(s): Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological, and histological investigations were employed to monitor the extents of PNS damage in a hSOD-1G93A ALS rat model. Light microscope and immunocytochemical analysis of human motor nerve biopsies were performed. Result(s): By in vivo magnetic resonance imaging, follow-up of the sciatic nerve allowed to define the imaging signature of the disease. Initial abnormalities within sciatic nerve were detected by an increase of T2 relaxation time, before symptom onset. In addition, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging acquired during disease course showed a progressive increase of mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (l ) within the sciatic nerve which was associated with reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) at advanced stage of disease. Neurophysiological examination showed a gradual reduction of sciatic nerve distal compound motor action potential amplitude during disease course and concomitant signs of active denervation at needle examination. Histology showed early impairment of the blood-nerve barrier, endoneurial oedema and acute axonal degeneration associated with signs of neuroinflammation, such as a macrophage response in the motor nerve compartments, before the appearance of symptoms. Progressive axonal degeneration and motor nerve fiber loss were observed, correlating with changes in MRI and neurophysiological studies. Histopathologic studies of human diagnostic motor nerve biopsies confirmed the presence of signs of acute axonal degeneration, associated with signs of neuroinflammation, predominantly represented by endoneurial macrophages and occasional epineurial inflammatory infiltrates. Discussion and conclusion: The functional and morphological platform established here could be used to follow disease progression in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis rat model and to evaluate possible therapies relevant to the disease. Moreover, the study of the peripheral nervous system involvement could also shed new lights in the ALS disease pathogenesis.

N2  - Background: Multiple sclerosis is characterized by inflammation, demyelination and gliosis, involving the central nervous system (CNS) and sparing the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is regarded as being restricted to the PNS as the immune response seems to be directed against an antigen confined to PNS proteins. However, patients presenting both central and peripheral demyelination have occasionally been reported. We report a case of patient with relapsing demyelinating disease of CNS associated with demyelinating polyneuropathy. Case report: A 53 year old woman presented a 7 year history of recurrent neurologic symptoms (Diplopia, ataxia, optic neuritis) with complete regression after intravenous corticotherapy. Her neurological examination out of the relapses was normal except of the generalized areflexia. Brain and spinal cord MRI demonstrated some small size white matter hyperintensities T2 (<3 mm of diameter) with contrast enhancement. CSF was acellular, with protein level 0.89 g/dl without any oligoclonal bands. Her electroneuromyography revealed a severe demyelinating sensory motor neuropathy with conduction blocks. The diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy was confirmed by a peripheral nerve biopsy. Body CT, PET, biopsy of the minor salivary glands, immunologic, biochemical and infectious investigations were normal. Conclusion(s): Immunological reactivity against antigens common to peripheral and central myelin or a higher general susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, may explain why the demyelinating disease affected both the CNS and PNS.

N2  - Introduction: It has been a challenge to devise non-invasive imaging methods that can visualize axons in peripheral nerves. We have successfully applied MR DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) to visualize nerve fibers in the clinical setting of traumatic nerve injuries and peripheral nerve tumors. Method(s): 14 patients underwent MR neurography that included two DTI sequences on a 3T whole body GE DVMR750 system including a full field of view single-shot EPI sequence with 28 diffusion weighted direction-encoded images and a reduced field of view diffusion method with 12 direction-encoded images that uses a 2D echo-planar RF pulse to excite and read out a rectangular-shaped field of view. Additional anatomic images were acquired as part of a routine MR neurogram protocol. Result(s): MR DTI successfully visualized nerve fibers within the capsule of peripheral nerve tumors. MR DTI also visualized nerve fibers and their absence in traumatized peripheral nerves. Intraoperative visual inspection and electrophysiological testing confirmed the location and relation of nerve fibers to tumors, as well as the presence and absence of nerve fibers in damaged peripheral nerve. Conclusion(s): MR DTI was used to visualize the relationship of axons to peripheral nerve tumors which can be helpful in the planning of surgical resections. It is also proving useful following traumatic nerve injuries to help determine the extent of axonal injury and may prove useful in determining whether axonal regeneration is occurring which might reduce the necessity for exploratory surgery.

N2  - Animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have become available over the past decade. In this study, longitudinalmagnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological and histological investigations were employed tomonitor the extent of peripheral nervous system damage in a rat model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis expressing themutated form of the human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD-1G93A). By in vivo magnetic resonance imaging, follow-up of the sciatic nerve allowed to define the imaging signature of the disease. Initial abnormalities within sciatic nerve were detected by an increase of T2 relaxation time, before symptom onset. In addition, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging acquired during disease course showed a progressive increase of mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (lambda) within the sciatic nerve which was associated with reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) at advanced stage of disease. Neurophysiological examination showed a gradual reduction of sciatic nerve distal compound motor action potential amplitude during disease course and concomitant signs of active denervation at needle examination. Histology showed early impairment of the blood-nerve barrier, endoneurial oedema, acute axonal degeneration associated with signs of neuroinflammation, such as a macrophage response in the motor nerve compartments, before the appearance of symptoms. Progressive axonal degeneration and motor nerve fibers loss were observed, correlating with changes in MRI and neurophysiological studies. Histopathologic studies of human diagnostic motor nerve biopsies confirmed the presence of signs of acute axonal degeneration, associated with signs of neuroinflammation, predominantly represented by endoneurial macrophages and occasional epineurial inflammatory infiltrates. The functional and morphological platform established here could be used to follow disease progression in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis rat model and to evaluate possible therapies relevant to the disease. Moreover, the study of the peripheral nervous system involvement could also shed new lights in the ALS disease pathogenesis.

N2  - Current outcome measures in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) show insufficient sensitivity to change to be useful in clinical trials. We investigated the responsiveness of quantitative MRI in CMT1A. We studied 20 patients with genetically confirmed CMT1A (9 females, 11 males, age 46+/-14 years, BMI 25.4+/-4.9 kg/m2) and 20 matched healthy volunteers (9 females, 11 males, age 43+/-14 years, BMI 25.1+/-4.6 kg/m2). Participants underwent quantitative MRI of the lower limbs at 3T repeated at a 12 month interval. The three-point Dixon fat-water separation method was used to generate fat fraction maps which were analysed at the mid-calf by defining regions of interest within six lower leg muscles bilaterally from which mean fat fraction was extracted for each participant. Mean lower leg fat fraction was increased at baseline in patients (15.8+/-25.5%) comparedwith volunteers (1.6+/-1.0%, p<0.001). Over 12months mean fat fraction significantly increased in patients by 1.3% (SEM=0.6%, p<0.05), whereas the volunteer fat fraction was unchanged (mean change 0.0%, SEM 0.1%, p=NS). The increase in fat fraction was similar across all muscles analysed: tibialis anterior +1.6%, peroneus longus +1.0%, lateral gastrocnemius +1.6%,medial gastrocnemius +1.4%, soleus +1.2%, tibialis posterior +1.1%. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients according to baseline fat fraction levels, classified as normal (<5%, n=8) or increased (>5%, n=9). Progression in one year was greater in those with increased baseline fat fraction (annual change +2.3%, SEM 1.1%) than those with normal baseline fat fraction (annual change +0.2%, SEM 0.1%, p<0.01 for comparison). Calculated standardised response mean (SRM) of mean lower leg fat fraction was 0.52 indicating moderate responsiveness over 12 months. This compares very favourably to currently used outcome measures such as the CMT Neuropathy Score which had SRM of 0.07 over 2 years in the placebo arm of the British-Italian Vitamin C trial. Responsiveness of MRI could be further increased by selecting moderately affected patients, or by quantifying fatty infiltration in distal calf or foot muscles for mildly affected patients. Increasing study follow up to two years will also increase responsiveness and this is underway. MRI provides the most responsive outcome measure identified to date for adults with CMT1A.

N2  - One of the major drawbacks in the management of patients with inflammatory neuropathies is the lack of objective and non-invasive measures to assess functional integrity of nerve fibers in proximal nerve segments. Such measures would be extremely useful to assess disease progression during treatment and to predict potential for recovery. Based on previous findings in pre-clinical studies (Lehmann et al., 2009), we investigated the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI for detecting neuropathic changes in proximal nerve segments in patients with inflammatory neuropathies (CIDP and GBS). A total of twenty-one individuals with and without neuropathy (mostly CIDP) underwent DTI of a defined sciatic nerve segment. Patients and controls were evaluated by clinical examination and nerve conduction studies at baseline and six months after the initial DTI scan. Some patients received a second scan six months after the initialMRI.We found that themean fractional anisotropy (FA) value was significantly lower in sciatic nerves from patients with peripheral neuropathy as compared to controls. FA values correlated with clinical disability scores and electrophysiological parameters of axonal damage at baseline and 6 months after MRI scan. We conclude that DTI-derived FA values are a sensitive measure to discriminate healthy from functionally impaired human sciatic nerve segments. DTI of proximal nerve segments might be useful for estimating the proximal axonal degeneration burden in patients with inflammatory neuropathies, particularly in those who do not have distal sensory or motor evoked potentials. It might be therefore useful to identify patients who might be more eligible for neuroprotection trials to impede axonal degeneration.

N2  - Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is an autosomal-dominant transmitted life-threatening multisystem disease, leading to misfolding and extracellular deposition of the protein transthyretin. With an incidence of about 0.1-1/m, it is rare in Germany and the US, nevertheless it is the most common form of hereditary amyloidosis with endemic appearance, e.g., in Portugal and Sweden. An axonal, distal-symmetric sensory-motor, and autonomic polyneuropathy (PNP) is one of its main manifestations (Hund et al., Neurology, 2001; Plante-Bordeneuve and Said, Lancel Neurol, 2011). We investigated in-vivo amyloid related nerve injury by large-coverage and high-resolution MR-Neurography prospectively in a sample of 20 patients with genetically confirmed TTR-FAP (13 with manifest polyneuropathy (measurements included: complete neurological examination, scoring for NIS-LL (Neuropathy- Impairment-Score-Lower-Limbs), NDS (Neuropathy- Deficit-Score), NSS (Neuropathy-Symptom-Score), and detailed neurographic measurements), and 7 neurological/ electrophysiological asymptomatic gene-carriers) in comparison to 60 healthy, age/gender-matched volunteers. Imaging was done on a 3T-MR-scanner (Magnetom/Trio/Siemens) with high-resolution T2-weighted fat-suppressed-sequences separately for each leg and lumbar plexus: 1) axial T2- TSE-fs-sequences from proximal thigh to distal ankle (140 slices/leg; TE/TR 55/5970m); 2) 3D-T2-IR-SPC-sequence with axial reformation for lumbar plexus and spinal nerves (TE/TR 202/3000). Manual segmentation of the lumbar plexus/sciatic/tibial/fibular/sural nerve as nerve-tissue-voxels was performed on each axial imaging slice (320/subject). Lesion-voxels were then classified fully-automated, operator-independent and statistical analysis was performed by using nested-two-way-ANOVA and pairwise contrast analysis. On quantitative evaluation, lesion-voxel number was significantly higher not only in symptomatic TTR-FAP (16556+/-3297; p<0.0001) but also in asymptomatic gene carriers (5728+/-1794; p=0.02) compared to healthy controls. Differences in lesion-voxel number between symptomatic and asymptomatic TTR-FAP were also highly significant (p<0.0001). Furthermore, intraneural lesion-voxel count showed a predominant proximal focus (thigh) of nerve lesions (proximal 35290+/-3275 vs. distal 12610+/-1380; p<0.0001). For the first time, lower limb nerve lesions in hereditary TTR-FAP were detectable in-vivo by using high-resolution MRN not only in patients with manifest PNP, but also in asymptomatic gene-carriers in whom detection on MR-Neurography precedes clinical/electrophysiological manifestation. This suggests that MRN can serve as a novel and sensitive diagnostic marker even of early asymptomatic stages of TTR-FAP. Furthermore, we found a clear proximoto- distal gradient in nerve lesions in all 20 TTR-FAP subjects, although symptoms prevail distally and not proximally,maybe leading to possible pathomechanisms in TTR-related PNP.

N2  - Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an acquired peripheral neuropathy of autoimmune etiology. The diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical, electrodiagnostic and laboratory features. MR imaging showing bilateral hypertrophy of brachial and/or lumbar plexuses may support the diagnostic suspicion. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been recently proposed as a noninvasive technique to evaluate the peripheral nerve microstructure in vivo. We tested if diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) and measurement of fractional anisotropy (FA) along the sciatic nerves can differentiate patients with CIDP from controls. We therefore performed a 1.5 T MRI (Aera, Siemens, Germany) on 10 patients affected by CIDP (mean age 50.2) and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (mean age 48.7) using the following imaging protocol: a) 3D magnetic resonance neurography (3D MRN) of brachial and lumbosacral plexuses, b) 2D MRN, and c) DTI of sciatic nerves at the level of thigh. DTT of the sciatic nerves was guided by color-coded FA maps overlaid on high resolution MRN. The FA values of the tracked segments of the sciatic nerves were compared between the two groups. The sciatic nerve cross sectional area (CSA) was also measured at the level of mid-thigh on the axial 2D MRN sections. The CSF protein concentration was available for 9 patients. T-test and Pearson correlation test were utilized for the statistical analysis. Threshold for significance was defined as p<0.05. In the patient group, plexus hypertrophy and increased signal intensity were detected in 13 out of 20 plexuses (65%) on 3D MRN. Sciatic nerve CSA was significantly increased in CIDP patients (mean 58.50+/-3.41 mm2) compared to controls (mean 86.20+/-22.07) (p=0.04). The sciatic nerve FA values were significantly lower in CIDP patients (mean 0.404, 95% C.I 0.378-0.427) than in healthy volunteers (mean 0.466, 95% C.I. 0.443-0.490) (p=0.001) and inversely correlated with the CSA values (r=-0.708, p=0.033). The association between the CSF protein concentration and FA values reached statistical significance (r=0.67, p=0.52). Our preliminary data suggest that noninvasive DTI assessment of the sciatic nerves may provide clinically useful information in addition to MRN in patients with CIDP. The quantitative assessment of FA can help further characterizing the effects of the disease processes on the structural integrity and directional coherence of the nerve fibers.

N2  - Background: Identifying and understanding primary errors of human axon guidance is complicated by the anatomical complexity of the central nervous system and the phenotypic complexity of disease processes. Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM) is a rare, Mendelian complex eye movement syndrome, which can be caused by primary errors of axon guidance. Since eye movements are controlled by anatomically well-defined motor axons, and abnormal eye movements are easily discerned, CFEOM offers a unique opportunity to understand how human axon guidance goes awry. Here, we identify the genetic, molecular, and neurodevelopmental features of a novel CFEOM subtype, characterized by intellectual disability, polymicrogyria, and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Methods and Results: We used linkage analysis followed by DNA sequencing to identify an inherited heterozygous missense mutation in the beta-tubulin isotype TUBB2B that segregates with CFEOM, polymicrogyria, and intellectual disability. To determine whether this mutation causes primary axon guidance abnormalities or abnormalities secondary to diffuse brain malformation, we first performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI reveals aberrations in commissural projection neuron trajectory, implying a paucity of homotopic connections. We next expressed exogenous Tubb2b- E421K in a mosaic fashion in developing mouse callosal projection neurons and found this to be sufficient to perturb homotopic connectivity, without affecting neuronal production or migration. Finally, by introducing the human mutation into yeast beta-tubulin, which is over 90% homologous with human beta-tubulin, we find that TUBB2B-E421K alters microtubule dynamics. Conclusion(s): These data provide evidence that TUBB2B mutations can cause primary axon guidance errors in the central and peripheral nervous system. Eight mutations in the closely related gene TUBB3 also disrupt microtubule dynamics and result in CFEOM. The shared molecular and neurodevelopmental features of TUBB3-CFEOM and TUBB2B-CFEOM support a convergent mechanism of axon dysinnervation caused by abnormal dynamic properties of neuronal microtubules.

N2  - Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) has been reported as one of the most common peripheral neuropathies. Carpal tunnel segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images is important for the evaluation of CTS. To date, manual segmentation, which is time-consuming and operator dependent, remains the most common approach for the analysis of the carpal tunnel structure. Therefore, we propose a new knowledge-based method for automatic segmentation of the carpal tunnel from MR images. The proposed method first requires the segmentation of the carpal tunnel from the most proximally cross-sectional image. Three anatomical features of the carpal tunnel are detected by watershed and polygonal curve fitting algorithms to automatically initialize a deformable model as close to the carpal tunnel in the given image as possible. The model subsequently deforms toward the tunnel boundary based on image intensity information, shape bending degree, and the geometry constraints of the carpal tunnel. After the deformation process, the carpal tunnel in the most proximal image is segmented and subsequently applied to a contour propagation step to extract the tunnel contours sequentially from the remaining cross-sectional images. MR volumes from 15 subjects were included in the validation experiments. Compared with the ground truth of two experts, our method showed good agreement on tunnel segmentations by an average margin of error within 1 mm and dice similarity coefficient above 0.9.

N2  - Purpose: To implement a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol for visualization of peripheral nerves in human forearm. Material(s) and Method(s): This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from 10 healthy participants. T1- and T2-weighted turbo spin echo with fat saturation, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and DTI sequences with 21 diffusion-encoding directions were implemented to acquire images of the forearm nerves with an 8 channel knee coil on a 3T MRI scanner. Identification of the nerves was based on T1-weighted, T 2-weighted, STIR, and DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) images. Maps of the DTI-derived indices, FA, mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity (lambda//), and radial diffusivity (lambda; ) along the length of the nerves were generated. Result(s): DTI-derived maps delineated the forearm nerves more clearly than images acquired with other sequences. Only ulnar and median nerves were clearly visualized on the DTI-derived FA maps. No significant differences were observed between the left and right forearms in any of the DTI-derived measures. Significant variation in the DTI measures was observed along the length of the nerve. Significant differences in the DTI measures were also observed between the median and ulnar nerves. Conclusion(s): DTI is superior in visualizing the median and ulnar nerves in the human forearm. The normative data could potentially help distinguish normal from diseased nerves. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Targeting tumor perfusion and oxygenation to improve the outcome of anticancer therapy
A1  - Jordan, Benedicte F.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are widespread clinical modalities for cancer treatment. Among other biological influences, hypoxia is a main factor limiting the efficacy of radiother-apy, primarily because oxygen is involved in the stabilization of the DNA damage caused by ionizing radiations. Radiobiological hypoxia is found in regions of rodent and human tumors with a tissue oxygenation level below 10 mmHg at which tumor cells become increasingly resistant to radiation damage. Since hypoxic tumor cells remain clonogenic, their resis-tance to the treatment strongly influences the therapeutic outcome of radiotherapy. There is therefore an urgent need to identify adjuvant treatment modalities aimed to increase tumor pO2 at the time of radiotherapy. Since tumor hypoxia fundamentally results from an imbalance between oxygen delivery by poorly efficient blood vessels and oxygen con-sumption by tumor cells with high metabolic activities, two promising approaches are those targeting vascular reactivity and tumor cell respiration.This review summarizes the current knowledge about the development and use of tumor-selective vasodilators, inhibitors of tumor cell respiration, and drugs and treatments combining both activities in the context of tumor sensitization to X-ray radiotherapy.Tumor-selective vasodilation may also be used to improve the delivery of circulating anticancer agents to tumors. Imaging tumor perfusion and oxygenation is of importance not only for the development and validation of such com-bination treatments, but also to determine which patients could benefit from the therapy. Numerous techniques have been developed in the preclinical setting. Hence, this review also briefly describes both magnetic resonance and non-magnetic resonance in vivo meth-ods and compares them in terms of sensitivity, quantitative or semi-quantitative properties, temporal, and spatial resolutions, as well as translational aspects. © 2012 Jordan and Sonveaux.

N2  - The observation of aerobic glycolysis by tumor cells in 1924 by Otto Warburg, and subsequent innovation of imaging glucose uptake by tumors in patients with PET-CT, has incited a renewed interest in the altered metabolism of tumors. As tumors grow in situ, a fraction of it is further away from their blood supply, leading to decreased oxygen concentrations (hypoxia), which induces the hypoxia response pathways of HIF1alpha, mTOR, and UPR. In normal tissues, these responses mitigate hypoxic stress and induce neoangiogenesis. In tumors, these pathways are dysregulated and lead to decreased perfusion and exacerbation of hypoxia as a result of immature and chaotic blood vessels. Hypoxia selects for a glycolytic phenotype and resultant acidification of the tumor microenvironment, facilitated by upregulation of proton transporters. Acidification selects for enhanced metastatic potential and reduced drug efficacy through ion trapping. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of preclinical and clinical drugs under development for targeting aerobic glycolysis, acidosis, hypoxia and hypoxia response pathways. Hypoxia and acidosis can be manipulated, providing further therapeutic benefit for cancers that feature these common phenotypes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..

N2  - Background: Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene at 17q11.2. In 95% of non-founder NF1 patients, NF1 mutations are identifiable by means of a comprehensive mutation analysis. 5-10% of these patients harbour microdeletions encompassing the NF1 gene and its flanking regions. NF1 is characterised by tumours of the peripheral nerve sheaths, the pathognomonic neurofibromas. Considerable inter- and intra-familial variation in expressivity of the disease has been observed which is influenced by genetic modifiers unrelated to the constitutional NF1 mutation. The number of plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) in NF1 patients is a highly heritable genetic trait. Recently, SNP rs2151280 located within the non-coding RNA gene ANRIL at 9p21.3, was identified as being strongly associated with PNF number in a family-based association study. The T-allele of rs2151280, which correlates with reduced ANRIL expression, appears to be associated with higher PNF number. ANRIL directly binds to the SUZ12 protein, an essential component of polycomb repressive complex 2, and is required for SUZ12 occupancy of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B tumour suppressor genes as well as for their epigenetic silencing. Method(s): Here, we explored a potential association of PNF number and PNF volume with SNP rs2151280 in 29 patients with constitutional NF1 microdeletions using the exact Cochran-Armitage test for trends and the exact Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Both the PNF number and total tumour volume in these 29 NF1 patients were assessed by whole-body MRI. The NF1 microdeletions observed in these 29 patients encompassed the NF1 gene as well as its flanking regions, including the SUZ12 gene. Result(s): In the 29 microdeletion patients investigated, neither the PNF number nor PNF volume was found to be associated with the T-allele of rs2151280. Conclusion(s): Our findings imply that, at least in patients with NF1 microdeletions, PNF susceptibility is not associated with rs2151280. Although somatic inactivation of the NF1 wild-type allele is considered to be the PNF-initiating event in NF1 patients with intragenic mutations and patients with NF1 microdeletions, both patient groups may differ with regard to tumour progression because of the heterozygous constitutional deletion of SUZ12 present only in patients with NF1 microdeletions. © 2012 Musotter et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Introduction We investigated the correlation between age and the fractional anisotropy (FA) values of peripheral nerves in healthy adults and compared the age-corrected FA values of peripheral nerves in healthy subjects and patients with polyneuropathy. Methods The institutional review board approved this study and informed consent was obtained from all participants before entry into the study. We optimized diffusion tensor imaging using a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner and an extremity coil for scanning tibial nerves. The effect of age and sex on the FA values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers was investigated and the age-corrected FA values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers and patients with polyneuropathy were compared. Results The maximum FAvalues of the tibial nerves remained constant until age 45 (approximately 0.516); they subsequently decreased by 0.004/year in healthy volunteers. After removing the effect of age with an age-adjusted equation, the median maximum FAvalues in the volunteers and patients were 0.518 (range, 0.406-0.616) and 0.442 (range, 0.376-0.530), respectively. The age-corrected FAvalues were significantly lower in the patients than the healthy volunteers (p<0.001). There was no significant gender-related difference in the maximum FA values of the tibial nerves (p=0.416). Conclusion The age-corrected FA value of the peripheral nerves helps to differentiate between age-related peripheral nerve degeneration and polyneuropathies. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Identifying the extent of involvement of the vessel and nerve, particularly in regard to preoperative evaluation and precise localization of the tumor and its relation to the structures of the extremities, has important applications for advancing the treatment of lower extremity diseases. To review the technical feasibility of simultaneous visualization of nerves and vessels of the lower extremities by using magnetization-prepared susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MP-SWI) at 3.0T. Ten healthy volunteers and 10 patients were studied. Optimized MP-SWI, MR neurography (MRN) based on 3D diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession imaging and contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) sequences were performed for each subject. The means of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)n, SNRv, SNRm, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)n,m and CNRv,m were calculated and the certainty of identifying nerves and vessels was determined. CNRn,m between MP-SWI and MRN, and CNRv,m between MP-SWI and CE-MRA were compared. MP-SWI provides slightly poorer CNRv,m than CE-MRA, whereas MP-SWI provides a better CNRn,m than MRN. In thin-slice-thickness maximum-intensity projection arbitrary planes, the sciatic nerve and its branches were clearly identified (score 1 or 2 of 2) in 17 subjects (85%); the femoral artery and the main branches were identified (score 1 or 2 of 2) in all 20 subjects (100%). The nerves are isointense to slightly hypointense to muscle, and the vessels show a more obvious hyperintense signal than muscle in MP-SWI. The proposed MP-SWI demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneously visualizing nerves and vessels of the lower extremities without using an exogenous contrast agent. It may enable straightforward localization of a disease process to a specific nerve and vessel.

N2  - Purpose: To define the optimal acquisition parameters for diffusion tensor imaging of the median nerve at the wrist and to measure the diffusion values. Patients and Methods: The wrists of 14 healthy volunteers were explored using 3T MRI with a dedicated wrist coil. Each examination consisted of six sequences, varying the number of directions (15 - 20 - 30) and the b values (500 - 800 - 1000 - 2000 s/mm2). The tractography images were evaluated by two radiologists using a qualitative scale with six levels. The diffusion and anisotropy coefficients (ADC and FA) were measured and the values compared with the data in the literature. Result(s): Median nerve tractography was successfully achieved in all sequences. The 20 direction sequence with b = 1000 s/mm2 seemed to provide the best results for a reasonable acquisition time (5'38''). The diffusion values showed large interindividual variations. Conclusion(s): Optimisation of acquisitions parameters is important in peripheral nerve tractography, and may facilitate a routine use of the technique. The images obtained are easy to analyse but the diffusivity and anisotropy coefficients are too variable, however, to be used in practice. © 2012 Editions francaises de radiologie.

N2  - Cobalt exerts well-known and documented toxic effects on the thyroid, heart and the haematopoietic system, in addition to the occupational lung disease, allergic manifestations and a probably carcinogenic action. Cobalt neurotoxicity is reported in isolated cases, and it has never been systematically treated. Bilateral optic atrophy and retinopathy, bilateral nerve deafness and sensory-motor polyneuropathy have been described long ago as a result of chronic occupational exposure to cobal powder or during long-term treatment of anaemia with cobalt chloride. Recently, some patients with high levels of cobalt released from metal prosthesis have been referred as presenting with tinnitus, deafness, vertigo, visual changes, optic atrophy, tremor and peripheral neuropathy. The aim of this work is to group these cases and to identify a possible mechanism of cobalt neurotoxicity, focusing on hypothetic individual susceptibility such as altered metal-binding proteins, altered transport processes in target cells or polymorphic variation of genetic background. © 2012 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome. It has recently been shown that the underlying DNA repair defect plays a central role in the aging process. In addition to skin symptoms, various premature neurological abnormalities have been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: We present the clinical neurological phenotype in 14 XP patients (seven subtypes), in seven of these patients together with conventional and multiparametric advanced MRI data to assess the macrostructural and microstructural cerebral morphology in comparison to controls, including volumetric measurements, MR spectroscopy (1H MRS), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Clinical hallmarks were spinocerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract signs, and mild cognitive deficits. DTI demonstrated significantly reduced WM directionality in all regions investigated, i.e. the thalamus, the corticospinal tracts and the dorsal corpus callosum. Single patients showed a marked relative hippocampal volume reduction, but the patients were not different from controls in the volumetric measurements of hippocampal and whole brain volumes at group level. However, 1H MRS demonstrated that the hippocampal formation was metabolically altered. Conclusion(s): The most prominent feature was the white matter affectation, as assessed by DTI, with volume and directionality reductions of the fiber projections involving both the craniocaudal fibers and the interhemispheric connections. These findings, although heterogeneous among the study sample, could be correlated with the clinico-neurological symptoms. The imaging findings support the position that myelin structures degrade prematurely in the brain of XP patients. © 2012 Kassubek et al.

N2  - Background: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a common inherited axonal or mixed axonal-demyelinating neuropathy. The disease is caused by mutations in the GJB1 gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin32, which is expressed in both Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Several reports have described CMTX patients presenting with transient and recurrent central nervous system (CNS) symptoms with transient white matter lesions in the brain. Patient(s): We describe a man with CMTX who presented with transient CNS symptoms and abnormal cerebral white matter lesions in MRI. He was subjected to a detailed MRI examination using two specialized techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Result(s): In the early stage of his CNS symptoms, MRS studies revealed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) levels in deep white matter, and DTI revealed reduced fractional anisotropy within lesions. Interestingly, these reductions began to recover from day 19 after admission, and follow-up DTI and MRS studies on day 101 revealed a reversal of the abnormalities. Conclusion(s): The findings of reversible reductions in fractional anisotropy and NAA levels in our patient suggest reversible axonal damage associated with deficient oligodendrocyte gap junctions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A single-shot echo-planar-imaging sequence (TR/TE 10123/40 ms) was acquired at four different b-values (800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 s/mm2). Two independent readers performed post processing and fiber-tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated. Fiber tracts of the median nerve were generated using four different algorithms containing different FA thresholds and different angulation tolerances. Data were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. Result(s): Tracking algorithms using a minimum FA threshold of 0.2 and a maximum angulation of 10degree were significantly better than other algorithms. Fiber tractography generated significantly longer fibers in DTI acquisitions with higher b-values (1200 and 1400 s/mm2 versus 800 s/mm2; p < 0.001). The overall quality of fiber tractography was best at a b-value of 1200 s/mm 2 (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): In conclusion, our results indicate use of b-values between 1000 and 1400 s/mm2 for DTI of the median nerve at 3.0 T. Optimal reconstruction parameters for fiber tractography should encompass a minimum FA threshold of 0.2 and a maximum angulation tolerance of 10. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders present at birth with muscle weakness, hypotonia and contractures. Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders with muscle weakness, hypotonia and contractures present at birth. A particular subset of classic CMD is characterized by a complete absence of merosin. Merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDCMD) is a rare genetic disease involving the central and peripheral nervous system in the childhood. High signal intensities are often observed throughout the centrum semiovale, periventricular, and sub-cortical white matters on T2-weighted images in MRI brain in children with MDCMD. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map may reveal increased signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient values in the periventricular and deep white matters. These white matter findings, observed in late infancy, decrease in severity with age. The pathogenesis of these changes remains uncertain at present. In this article, we outline the specific MR imaging findings seen in a patient with documented MDCMD and also suggest the causes.

N2  - Ultrasonography is widely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a common peripheral neuropathy, but the reported diagnostic accuracy varies. This meta-analysis focused on the diagnostic test accuracy of ultrasonography for diagnosing CTS. Structured searches of PubMed for 1990-2010 were done and the data were extracted and meta-analyzed by pooling estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios. Diagnostic performance was also judged by using a summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Twenty-eight trials involving 3995 wrists were included. A greater cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel inlet (CSA-I) and a greater flattening ratio at the level of the hamate were seen in CTS wrists than in control wrists. A CSA-I >=9 mm2 is the best single diagnostic criterion, with a diagnostic odds ratio of 40.4 (sensitivity 87.3%, specificity 83.3%). © 2012.

N2  - Introduction Intrinsic foot muscle atrophy is already present in a non-neuropathic stage of diabetes and increases with the severity of peripheral neuropathy [Greenman et al, 2005; Andersen et al, 2004]. The atrophy of small foot muscles may result in prominent metatarsal heads, toe deformity and limited joint mobility. These problems have been associated with increased plantar forefoot pressure, a major risk factor in plantar ulcer formation (Pham et al, 2000). The present study examines whether the toe flexor strength and the muscle volume of the intrinsic foot muscles in the diabetic neuropathic foot can be increased using a targeted training. Methods Fourteen diabetic patients (6 f/ 8 m; 56 +/- 7.2 years; Diabetes Typ I/II: 6/8; Diabetes duration 16.6 +/- 9.7 years) performed a toe flexor training with 70% of the maximal voluntary isometric contraction on a custom made dynamometer for eight weeks, three days per week, four sets per session, twelve repetitions (3s loading/ 3s relaxation). The maximal plantar flexion moment of the metatarsophalangeal joint (max MMPJ) was quantified on both feet before and after the intervention. The volume of the intrinsic foot muscles (VIFM) in the right forefoot was examined before and after the intervention using magnetic resonance imaging (1.0 T) with a circumferential extremity coil and, was analysed with manual segmentation on a section using software (ImageJ). The stage of peripheral neuropathy was assessed by the Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS) and Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments (SWMF). Results Seven patients were classified as neuropathic with moderate to severe peripheral neuropathy (NDS >= 6; SWMF >= 5.07/10g). The toeflexor strength increased significantly by about 55.3% on the left and 57.4% on the right foot following the intervention (fig. 1). Due to severe fat infiltration and substantial degeneration of the intrinsic foot muscles (fig. 2), the VIFM was only examined in seven subjects. The VIFM increased in these subjects by about 5.1% (pre: 51.3 cm3, post: 54.6 cm3). Discussion Before the intervention, the diabetic patients exhibited less than one third of the values for toe flexor strength of young healthy subjects [Goldmann et al 2011]. The increase in toe flexor strength was found in both neuropathic and nonneuropathic patients. One can speculate that enhancements in toe flexor strength and in intrinsic foot muscle volume may contribute to decreased peak plantar pressures, thus reducing the risk of ulceration in the diabetic neuropathic foot.

N2  - Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a relapsing or chronic progressive peripheral neuropathy. Thickened peripheral nerves or enlarged nerve roots have been detected in subpopulations of CIDP, exhibiting unique symptoms such as compression myelopathy. However, it is not well understood why nerve hypertrophy occurs only in some patients with CIDP, and not in others. To clarify the characteristics of hypertrophic form of CIDP, we assessed the clinicopathological features of 8 patients with CIDP who had extensive peripheral nerve hypertrophy who were referred to our institution. All patients fulfilled the criteria for CIDP proposed by Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task Force (1991), and were negative for genetic abnormality for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. Patients consisted of six men and two women, aged 33 to 70 years. The duration from onset of neuropathy to diagnosis widely ranged from 2 to 21 years (mean 12.9 years). Diffuse or focal hypertrophy was found in the nerve roots in six patients and peripheral nerve trunk in six patients. Abnormal enhancement by gadolinium at the site of hypertrophy was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging in six patients. Patients tended to show sensory-dominant neuropathy pattern with sensory ataxia. Cranial nerve involvement was reported in three patients. Cerebrospinal fluid protein was markedly elevated (mean 411 mg/dL) in most patients without an increase of cell count. Nerve conduction studies revealed marked slowing of motor nerve conduction velocities and prolongation of distal latencies in all patients. Temporal dispersion also was evident. Sensory nerve action potentials were not evoked in six patients. Sural nerve biopsy specimens revealed onion bulb formation in seven of eight patients. Slow insidious progression of clinical symptoms, particularly predominant in sensory symptoms, tended to lead to delayed initiation of treatment. In conclusion, a prolonged course without treatment could have induced extensive nerve damage of demyelination and subsequent hypertrophic change. Alternatively, these patients might intrinsically tend to develop nerve hypertrophy based on some unknown genetic susceptibility, resulting in a clinical and pathological variant of CIDP of a certain pathologic background, different from that in typical CIDP.

N2  - To investigate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation during somatosensory electrical stimulation of the median nerve in acute stroke patients and to determine its correlation with ischemic damage and clinical recovery over time. Fourteen acute stroke patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during contralesional median-nerve electrical stimulation 12-48 h after stroke. Findings were then validated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and motor evoked potential by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Poor clinical recovery at three months was noted in four patients with no activation in the early days after stroke, whereas good clinical recovery was observed in eight patients with a normal activation pattern in the primary sensory motor area in the acute phase. In two patients BOLD activation correlated weakly with clinical recovery. Findings from TMS and DTI partially correlated with clinical recovery and functional scores. Clinically relevant insights into the "functional reserve" of stroke patients gained with peripheral nerve stimulation during fMRI may carry prognostic value already in the acute period of a cerebrovascular accident. BOLD activation maps could provide insights into the functional organization of the residual systems and could contribute to medical decision making in neurological and rehabilitative treatment.

N2  - Background: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT-X) is an X-linked dominant hereditary peripheral neuropathy, Transient and recurrent central nervous system involvement with white matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported in this condition, but usually in the context of abnormal neurologic symptoms. We initiated a study of CNS involvement in a large family with CMT-X to understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype of CNS white matter involvement. Method(s): We performed the standard of care clinical MRI, directional diffusivity DTI sequences, and detailed neurological evaluation of 9 family members with CMT-X; All participants had peripheral neuropathy and genetic confirmation of CMT-X. Only one subject had symptoms of CNS disease. Result(s): White matter signal changes were found in all cases of varying degrees of severity affecting the corpus callosum and periventricular areas with a posterior predominance similar to previous reported cases. In one case, there were profound multifocal white matter abnormalities. Conclusion(s): There can be changes in the white matter of patients with CMT-X in absence of symptoms of CNS disease. Further analysis of the changes in the directional diffusivities could potentially differentiate between the axonal and myelin pathology.

N2  - Frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD) can lead to dementia with early progressive personality changes and behavioural problems or distinct clinical subgroups like primary progressive aphasia or semantic dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may demonstrate lobar degeneration; post mortem neuropathology is heterogeneous with detection of tau-positive and tau-negative patients. Case report: A 71 year old retired female teacher in otherwise good health presented with a two year history of progressive dysarthria without any swallowing problems. Personality, cognitive function and intellectual interests were maintained as activities of daily living as witnessed by patient and her husband. Unarticulated verbal expression had led to some social retreat and moderate depression. Neurologic examination on admission revealed a severe dysarthrophonia with impaired articulation movements and was otherwise normal, a laryngoscopy showed normal pharyngeal and vocal chord anatomy. Neurophysiologic examination of peripheral nerves and muscles including the tongue were normal as were magnetic stimulation including triple stimulation technique to hand- and leg muscles. No decrement was found with repetitive stimulation of accessory and facial nerves, no response to articulate abilities was seen with injection of a cholinesterase inhibitor. Serum antibodies (Acetylcholine receptor, Muscle specific kinase, Voltage gated calcium channel) were negative; the spinal fluid was normal including tau protein. MRI revealed a frontotemporal atrophy especially of the left perisylvian region, a cerebral scintigraphy showed a left temporoparietal hypoperfusion. On formal speech testing no deficits in perception or naming were detected, minimal deficits were seen in generation of words. Reading perception and writing were intact. On neuropsychologic testing moderate deficits in verbal and visual memory and mild deficits of attention and executive functions were detected. Conclusion(s): Though MRI and brain perfusion studies were compatible with primary progressive aphasia as a variant of FTLD, our patient did not have aphasia on speech testing while neuropsychologic testing was compatible with a mild dementia still compensated in daily living. If the university education and the maintained intellectual interests of our patient might have masked aphasia or if the presented case represents a distinct subgroup of FTLD may be subject of future analysis of cases with FTLD.

N2  - Purpose/Aim: To provide an overview of the potential role of DTI in acute trauma, how to interpret DTI findings, and recognize its limitations. Content Organization: DTI has been used in acute conditions such as spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and nerve transection. A clear understanding of the potential role of DTI in emergency radiology and its limitations is necessary before DTI can be used clinically. Potential uses: Spinal cord ischemia and trauma: In cases of acute spinal cord injury, clinical CT and MRI often underestimate the extent of injury. Spinal cord DTI tractography, however, demonstrates disruption or complete interruption of normal fiber anatomy in these cases. Potentially, DTI tractography can be used to facilitate a more specific diagnosis for acute spinal cord injury. Nerve transection: DTI can be used to individually delineate cranial nerves and peripheral nerves such as the median nerve. DTI can be used to facilitate diagnosis of complete versus partial nerve transection. TBI: Conventional MRI underestimates the degree of white matter damage. DTI can potentially better elucidate post traumatic axonal injury. In the acute setting, DTI can be used to better diagnose severity of damage and potentially help distinguish between accidental and nonaccidental pediatric trauma. Unfortunately, numerous pitfalls exist currently limiting its use clinically. These include: influence of hardware and sequence parameters on DTI metrics necessitating a normal database for comparison, no agreement as to best analysis techniques, inability to assess chronicity of findings, and inability to directly attribute many DTI findings to a particular etiology. Summary/Conclusion: DTI is more sensitive to neuronal changes than current clinical MR techniques and has a potential role in emergency radiology. It is important for radiologists and trainees to begin understanding the utility and limitations of DTI since it is a powerful technique that is starting to enter the clinical scene.

N2  - Objective: MNGIE is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss of function mutations in the nuclear gene encoding tymidine phosphorylase that led to mitochondrial DNA defects. Typical findings are severe gastrointestinal dysmotility, cachexia, ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, peripheral neuropathy, and white matter (WM) changes on brain MRI often diffuse despite the absence of mental retardation or deterioration. The aim of this study was to characterize in six MNGIE patients the leucoencephalopathy combining advanced MR techniques such as MR spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Method(s): Brain MR studies were performed using a 1.5T GE scanner. Six patients with a molecular diagnosis of MNGIE and 14 healthy controls were studied. Conventional T1 and T2-weighetd MR images were acquired. 1H- MRS was used to assess in brain WM concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), marker of neuronal and axonal integrity; creatine-phosphocreatine (Cr); choline (Cho), component of membranes phospholipids. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired to quantify diffusion parameters of water molecules, such as mean diffusivity (MD). Group differences were calculated using the Student T-test. Correlations were performed between 1H-MRS, DTI and clinical parameters, using the Pearson test 1-tailed (statistical significance: P < 0.05). Result(s): In all six patients a diffuse confluent cerebral and/or cerebellar leucoencephalopathy was present. In patients WM [NAA], [Cr], and [Cho] were lower (P < 0.05) and WM MD higher (P < 0.05) than in controls. WM MD values were negatively correlated with WM [NAA] and positively correlated with the age of patients (P < 0.05). The reduction in all 1H -MRS metabolites in the brain WM of MINGIE patients can be explained by a dilution effect due to increased brain water content demonstrated by the increased WM MD values. This pattern is not reported among other leukoencephalopathies or mitochondriopathies. Conclusion(s): Our results are consistent with the functional alteration of the blood brain barrier and the absence of detectable brain axonal/neuronal loss, demyelination, and gliosis demonstrated in a previous post-mortem study of two MNGIE patients (Szigeti K. et al., Ann Neurol 2004). The correlations between MRS, DTI changes and the age of patients suggest that these MR parameters are robust bio-markers of disease, usable for monitoring therapeutic trials.

N2  - Background and aims: We previously demonstrated that muscle perfusion and mitochondrial function were impaired in type 2 diabetic patients, especially in those with poor glycemic control and in those with multiple microangiopathic complications. The aim of this study was to assess the association of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy with muscle perfusion and/or mitochondrial oxidative activity. Material(s) and Method(s): We examined 96 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 56.7+/- 9.3 years with body mass index 27.5 +/- 4.1 kg/m2 and HbA1c 7.6 +/- 1.8 %, and without peripheral vascular disease. Multiparametric functional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (mpf-NMR) was performed to investigate muscle perfusion (Arterial Spin Labelled (ASL) NMR imaging (NMRI), oxygenation (dynamic proton NMR spectroscopy (1H-NMRS) of deoxymyoglobin (dMb) and mitochondrial function (spectroscopy 31P) at rest, during and after an ischemic exercise of calf muscles. Symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy were graded using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). Vascular sympathetic activity was evaluated by the power of the low frequency spectrum of systolic blood pressure variations in the standing position (LF-SBP) using the Finapres system. Result(s): No relation was found between RMN parameters and retinopathy. Maximal muscle reperfusion after ischemic exercise correlated negatively with urinary albumin excretion rate (r= -0.328, p=0.002) and was significantly lower in the patients with nephropathy (n=24) (p<0.01), even after adjustment on body mass index. Maximal muscle reperfusion was also lower in the patients with peripheral neuropathy (MNSI >= 2.5/10; n=14) (p=0.057). Reoxygenation time of myoglobin correlated negatively with MNSI (r= -0.281, p<0.01) and was longer (which means a defect of oxygenation) in the patients with peripheral neuropathy (p<0.01) than in those without. A defect of oxygenation was also associated with higher HbA1c levels (p<0.01) and lower vascular sympathetic activity (p=0.01), and remained associated with peripheral neuropathy after adjustment on age and HbA1c. Conclusion(s): In type 2 diabetic patients the association between microalbuminuria and inadequate perfusion is consistent with the role of endothelial dysfunction in the impairment of muscle perfusion. The lower muscle oxygenation in the patients with peripheral neuropathy may result from a reduction in muscle sympathetic activity, possibly through a lower muscle perfusion.

N2  - Both acute and chronic pain has been well documented as one of the most frequent and distressing symptoms in cancer, and have been shown to adversely affect quality of life. [1] [2] In a recent systematic review of 52 studies, 2 pooled prevalence rates for cancer pain were reported for four subgroups of patients: (1) in studies that included patients after curative treatment 33% (95% CI 21% to 46%); (2) in studies that included patients on cancer treatment 59% (CI 44% to 73%); (3) in studies in patients with advanced or metastatic disease, 64% (CI 58% to 69%); and (4) studies in patients at all stages of the disease, 53% (CI 43% to 63%). Across all of the studies evaluated, approximately 33% of the patients reported moderate to severe pain.[3] Cancer pain is a complex multifactorial phenomenon. The overall concept of cancer pain does not suffice to classify or describe the different pain characteristics that are due to different tumour related, etiologic, pathophysiologic, anatomic, treatment-related and temporal factors. Psychological and patient-related factors strongly influence the individual pain experience. Up-to-date there is no clear standardised approach or taxonomy used for assessing neuropathic pain in patients with cancer, and little consensus exist concerning definitions, framework, format and content related to two related yet distinct concepts; pain assessment and pain classification in relation to cancer. It is recommended that pain intensity should be assessed by a simple 11-point NRS, whereas well validated instruments such as the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) or the McGill Short Form questionnaire are recommended for a more comprehensive, multidimensional pain assessment. Despite recommendations, pain is still not routinely measured in cancer clinical practice. This may reflect the fact that most tools are too long and cumbersome for patients and clinicians to use.[4] And yet there is a continuous flow of new instruments, and only a minority is developed according to standardized development procedures.[5] Neuropathic pain (NP), is pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.[6] NP pain in cancer (NCP) is commonly presented in cancer patients and is considered a well-established entity for more than 20 years.[7] ; can occur if the nervous system itself is damaged, by tumour infiltration of nerves, tumour-associated toxins, therapyrelated toxins, or surgical damage. It is characterized by spontaneous and provoked pain, by positive symptoms such as paresthesias and dysesthesias, and by negative signs (sensory deficits) reflecting the neural damage.[8] Despite the fact that the exact prevalence of NCP remains unknown, available data demonstrate that a neuropathic component is present in approximately, 1/3 of cancer patients, usually mixed with nociceptive components, or, occasionally, as a single autonomous entity. Thus although as much as 9% of cancer patients have solely NP, many have a mixed pain syndrome.[9] [10] Diagnostic criteria to identify NP are proposed by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) of the International Association for the Study of Pain. A detailed history and clinical examination are fundamental to a correct diagnosis. A grading system of definite, probable, and possible NP pain has been proposed by a group of experts for clinical and research purposes, in recognition that there is no gold standard and is based on pain distribution, causality, clinical examination and diagnostic tests. (ref. Nr 6) Screening tools and questionnaires are useful in indicating probable NP. Several scales have been developed to evaluate various symptoms associated with NP pain, including the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Pain, Neuropathic pain questionnaire, the Pain Neurotoxicity Questionnaire, and Pain Detect. They include patient self-reported data, as well as various components of a physical examination. The common denominators across these questionnaires are set of descriptors (sensations of pins and needles, heat or burning, impaired temperature sensitivity, numbness, and electric shock-like sensations; whether or not the pain becomes worse with touch, and whether the joints are painful). [11] [12] Electrophysiological techniques, quantitative sensory testing, skin and nerve biopsies, and magnetic resonance imaging can be useful to detect lesions of the central or peripheral nervous system. The main advantage of screening tools is to identify potential patients with NP, particularly by non-specialists (grade A). However, these tools fail to identify 10-20% of patients with clinician diagnosed NP, showing that they cannot replace careful clinical judgment. DN4 reports only about half the cancer NP cases diagnosed by clinicians. There are a few reports validating the questionnaires in various groups of patients with cancer. [13] In a recent systematic review, by M. I. Bennett et al, on the Prevalence and aetiology of NP pain in cancer patients including 19 studies in 11,063 patients, they found that 6569 (59.4%) had nociceptive pain, 2102 (19%) had neuropathic pain, 2227 (20.1%) had mixed-mechanism pain, and 165 (1.5%) were classified as having pain due to unknown or other causes. Therefore the prevalence of NP ranged from a conservative estimate of 19% (9.4% to 28.4%, CI 95%) to a liberal estimate of 39.1% (28.9% to 49.5%) of all patients with cancer pain. It must be stressed though that only 14 studies (64%) clearly stated the use of confirmatory testing as part of the diagnostic criteria consistent with the current grading system for NP pain, and only 8 fully met the NeuPSIG diagnostic criteria. A standardised approach to clinical assessment is essential if neuropathic mechanisms are to be identified with certainty, for appropriate treatment to be initiated, and for data to be comparable across studies.[14] Cancer survival is significantly increased all over Europe. [15] In the US, 10.5 million subjects are cancer survivors. Sixty-four percent of adult cancer patients diagnosed during 1995-2001 reached their 5-year survival. [16] [17] Once an explosive disease that lead to a quick demise, cancer has now become a chronic disease, characterized by a high prevalence of disturbing and persistent physical symptoms and multitude of psychosocial and economic issues that diminish their quality of life, with pain being one of the most disturbing and devastating one. [18] According to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Office of Cancer Survivorship, an individual is considered a cancer survivor from the time of cancer diagnosis, through the balance of his or her life.[19] In an editorial in Annals of Oncology, [20] it is stated that there is a need to strictly define the population to be studied and distinguish the patients with active disease (persons living with cancer) from the disease and treatment-free patients from at least 5 years (cancer survivors), as cancer survivorship has 3 distinct phases: acute, extended, and permanent. The acute phase starts at the time of diagnosis and lasts until initial treatment is completed; the extended phase begins with completion of initial treatment resulting in partial or complete remission and is characterized by regular follow-up with or without maintenance or intermittent therapy; the permanent survival phase follows the extended phase during which patients have a very low likelihood of recurrence of their primary cancer but might be at some risk of developing associated cancers or cancers secondary to their initial anticancer therapy. (ref. 19) On the light of the quite broad definition and the heterogenicity of the cancer survivors population it is inevitable that research is not focused yet, although a few reports exist on the quality of life and other parameters of the cancer survivors life, but not many on pain and especially on neuropathic pain as an aspect of quality of life. Chronic pain in cancer survivors is caused by residual tissue damage from the cancer, and/or the cancer therapy: surgery, chemotherapy, steroids, hormones, and radiation. Cancer survivors may also have chronic pain from cancer related conditions such as postherpetic neuralgia and non associated chronic conditions such as collagen vascular diseases, degenerative arthritis, and diabetic neuropathy. Studies on the prevalence of pain in cancer survivors are scarce. Cancer survivors experiencing chronic pain constitute about 40% of all patients' visits to Pain and Palliative Care Program at a NCI-designated, Comprehensive Cancer Center. [21] The research on pain and neuropathy conducted among cancer survivors is of varying quality. A vast amount of literature addresses cancer pain symptoms, but long-term pain and neuropathy among disease-free survivors has received far less attention, despite evidence that pain can be severe compromising recovery and the quality of life. [22] Few cross-sectional or prospective longitudinal studies document the incidence, time course, and problems associated with the long-term effects of pain and neurologic impairment.[ 23] Data from surveillance studies are limited, making it difficult to estimate the prevalence and incidence of long-term pain and neuropathies among cancer survivors, as well as their susceptibility to developing these conditions.

N2  - Objectives: To observe the apprearance of MRI, pathology and ultra microstructure of the rabbit's sciatic nerve after argon-helium cryoablation, evaluate the influence of the argon-helium cryoablation to rabbit's sciatic nerve, the sciatic nerve repair and regeneration after cryoablation, provide the experimental evidence for the safety and feasibility of the procedures, which are adjacent to peripheral nerve, by argon-helium cryoabation under imaging guidance in clinic. Method(s): 20 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into two groups (A group and B group). Each group has 10 rabbits. Each left leg was experimental side, right as control side. Under general anesthesia, all 20 rabbits' bilateral sciatic nerves were scanned with 3.0T MRI in order to choose the experimental sciatic nerve and definite the frozen region. Argon-helium cryoablation were performed under an open 0.23T MRI guidance with 1.47 mm diameter cryoablational probe by a twice repeated freeze-thaw cycle, which 100% flow rate of argon gas was maintained to achieve freezing for 12 minutes and correspondingly helium gas was used to thaw for 3 minutes. In A group, experimental sciatic nerve with 3 mm diameter area was in the center of the ice ball. In B group, experimental sciatic nerve with 3 mm diameter area was near the ice ball. The follow-up imaging were scanned with 3.0T MRI after cryoablation immediately, 7d, 14d, 30d and 60d to observe the rabbit's sciatic nerves and their surrounding imaging changes and adjacent areas imaging changes, measure the signal intensity of sciatic nerves and muscle, and then calculate the signal intensity ratio of nerve and muscle and then examined the nerves pathology and the ultra microstructure. 2 rabbits were sacrificed in the same time. Take left and right sciatic nerve to observe the changes of tissue by light microscope and transmission electron microscope. Result(s): Intraoperative imaging appearance of MRI: The ice ball appears as a dark signal void in both FE T1WI and CBASS sequences. During the cryoablation, the size of ice ball is gradually increased. The ice ball reach biggest size for 10 min. In A group, the experimental position is in the center of the ice ball. In B group, the experimental position is near the ice ball. General observation after cryoablation: The activity of the rabbit's left leg changes after cryoablation; the ankle down, toe show loss of function. Motor function are partial recovered at 60d in the A group (both 2 rabbits) and obviously recovered in the B group than A group (both 2 rabbits). Ulcers were appeared in the rabbit's foot at 30 days after cryoablation in both two groups. In A group, the ulcers do not heal at 60 days (both 2 rabbits); in B group ulcers partly heal at 60 days (both 2 rabbits). Imaging appearance of rabbit sciatic nerve before cryoablation and in immediately, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days and 60 days after cryoablation: There were no obvious changes in T1WI sequence in experimental sides in all 20 rabbits. However, in T2WI and FS-T2WI sequence, the cryoablational segment of the sciatic nerve become thick and twist, the signal of the injured nerve become higher than normal. The sciatic nerve/muscle signal intensity ratio (SIR) of the injured sides was significantly higher than the control. The difference of SIR between two group experimental side is significant. The SIR of experimental side increase immediately after cryoablation and reach the peak at 7d, whereafter, the SIR decreased in 30d and 60d after cryoablation, but still higher than control. There is no abnormality in the control side in MRI. Pathology appearance of the rabbits' sciatic nerve tissue after Argon-helium cryoablation: In the A group, the sciatic nerve appearance severe injury immediately after argon-helium cryoablation, nerve fiber degeneration, axonal swelling and myelin sheath loose. The damage reached a peak at 14d, nerve fibers sheath performed, arranged disorder. Whereafter, the nerve began to repair. At 60d, the regeneration of axons and Schwann cells appear, but necrotic nerve fibers still can be seen. In B group, the nerve also appear injury immediately after cryoablation, but not so serious as A group. There is only a part of the nerve fiber degeneration, at 7d the damage reach a peak also. Then the nerve begin to repair and regeneration, at 60d bulk fibers have repaired. Conclusion(s): The formation of ice ball and the extent of the injury region could be demonstrated accurately by intraoperative MRI. The pathology and function of sciatic nerve with 3 mm diameter could be influenced by Argon-helium cryoablation under image-guided. The peripheral nerve with 3 mm could be damaged by cryoablation when the ice ball wrapped the nerve, including appeared nerve degeneration and necrosis. The nerve damage reach the peak at 14d after freezing, and then, the nerve begin to repair. In 60d, the damage can not be repaired completely. In clinical, when treating tumors which wraps peripheral nerve, we should be careful. When treating the tumors adjacent to peripheral nerve, we should be consider that the function of the nerve would loss at a long time. MRI can make the diagnosis of the freezing injury and repair of peripheral nerve with normal sequence.

N2  - Background and Purpose-The aim of the work is to investigate the blood oxygenation level dependent activation during somatosensory electrical stimulation of median nerve in acute stroke patients and to define the correlation with ischemic damage (anatomical images) and with the clinical recovery over time. Methods-Fourteen acute stroke patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during contralesional median-nerve electrical stimulation with 3T Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner (MAGNETOM Allegra, Siemens) from 12 to 48 hours after stroke. A new method to measure the haemodynamic reponse in stroke patients was studied. Diffusion tensor imaging and motor evoked potential by Transcranial magnetic stimulation were also acquired to validate the findings. Different clinical scales as National Institute of Health scale, Barthel index, European Stroke Scale, tactile-thermal scale, and Kinesthetic Sensitivity Test at the time of fMRI recording (to), one month after stroke (t1), and four-five months after stroke (t2) were measured. Results- Four patients with no fMRI activation during somatosensory stimulation in the early days after stroke had bad clinical recovery after three months, whereas eight patients with a normal activation pattern in primary sensory motor area in acute phase had good clinical recovery. Two patients showed low correlation between bold activation and clinical recovery. TMS and DTI were partially correlated with clinical recoveryand fMRI findings. Conclusions-Stimulation of peripheral nerve during the functional magnetic resonance imaging provide important clinical insights on the "functional reserve" in patients affected by stroke wityh an important prognostic value already in the acute period of cerebrovascular accident.

N2  - Objective: i) To develop MTR protocols of the human sciatic nerve (SN) in vivo and ii) to apply these protocols in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) to assay dysmyelination. Background Recent clinical trials in patients with CMT1A have raised the need for sensitive, noninvasive biomarkers to track disease progression. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) MRI has been shown to be sensitive to myelin content in the central nerves. However, no studies have used MTR to study peripheral neuropathies in humans in vivo. Design/Methods: MTR was measured in three healthy volunteers (28-36 y.o.) and three CMT1A patients (54-60 y.o.) in an axial volume immediately proximal to the knee. Volumes were acquired with/without an MT-prepulse (25 ms, 1000degree, 1.5 kHz off-resonance) at 0.8 x 0.8 x 3 mm3 resolution, yielding 45 slices in 6 min. Fat was suppressed via a binomial pulse. Regions of interested (ROIs) were selected for the SN and mean slice-wise MTR values were calculated: MTR = 1- SMT/S0, where SMT/S0 are signal intensities with/without the MT-prepulse. Result(s): High-resolution MTR imaging of the SN was achieved at an adequate signal-to-noise ratio (aD;40 for non-MT-weighted images) and level of fat suppression. The mean (+/-SD) MTR over all slices was reduced in CMT1A patients (0.33+/-0.01) relative to controls (0.37+/-0.02). A length-dependent reduction in MTR was also observed in one of the CMT1A patients (aD;25% lower values in distal relative to proximal portions of the SN). The slice-wise MTR values were relatively constant in the other two CMT1A patients and in the controls. Conclusion(s): MTR imaging is feasible and may detect pathological changes in the proximal nerves of CMT1A patients. We are enrolling a larger cohort of patients with CMT1A in which MTR values and diffusion metrics (sensitive to axonal degeneration) will be correlated with electrophysiological findings and disability scores.

N2  - Hypertrophy of spinal nerve root and peripheral nerves trunks is suggestive of a demyelinating polyneuropathy and is present in more than half of patients affected with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). We report a 75-year-old who had been complaining of slowly progressing distal paresthesias at four limbs and gait impairment for the last 5 years. Neurological evaluation showed bilateral foot drop, distal hyposthenia at lower limbs (tibial anterior MRC 3/5 on the right side and 2/5 on the left side, extensor hallucis longus MRC 3/5 on the right side and 0/5 on the left side, gastrocnemiousMRC4/ 5 bilaterally), lower limbs and distal upper limbs hypotrophy and abolished deep tendon reflexes at lower limbs. Neurophysiological evaluation revealed a chronic sensory-motor demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with secondary axonal degeneration. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed elevated protein level (502 mg%). CIDP was diagnosed. A peripheral nerve ultrasound evaluation was then performed revealing diffuse and significant enlargement of nerve cross sectional area (CSA) at four limbs, both proximally and distally: right ulnar nerve CSA 75 mm2 at wrist (normal values <=6 mm2), 91 mm2 at forearm (normal values <=8 mm2), 149 mm2 at arm (normal values <=11 mm2), right peroneal nerve CSA 48 mm2 at fibular head (normal values <=14 mm2) and 81 mm2 at peroneal fossa (normal values <=16 mm2), left sural nerve CSA 9 mm2 at median third of the leg (normal values <=3 mm2). Spinal MRI showed also diffuse thickening of the spinal roots, especially at the cervical level (diameter of 13 mm), and also of the lumbar plexus (root diameter 12 mm). After gadolinium injection a mild root enhancement was present. In our patient the findings were exemplary of nerve trunk and root hypertrophy in CIDP and both ultrasound and MRI confirmed the diagnosis.

N2  - Background: Neurologic involvement in Sjogren Syndrome (SS) occurs in approximately 25% of patients. Manifestations are different and may affect the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system (CSN). Neurological complications often precede or reveal SS. Cognitive dysfunctions seem to be frequent in SS. Two patterns have been described: disorders mimicking Alzheimer's disease and subcortical disorders. Aim(s): To describe a case of early Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) in SS. Case report: A 56 years old woman was admitted to our Department for cognitive decline. The symptoms started three years before with progressive difficulties of speech, subjective memory deficit, behavioural abnormalities, disphagia and progressive difficulty in writing. Neurological examination showed bucco-facial and ideomotor apraxia. The neuropsychological assessment revealed an impairment of praxis, attentional and executive functions, a speech articulation deficit and dysgraphia. General blood tests were normal. SSA-Ro and SSB-La antibody titles were positive. Brain MRI and SPECT of cerebral perfusion documented the involvement of frontal and temporal area. Conclusion(s): CNS involvement in SS is probably underestimated and the diagnosis is often delayed. SS should be suspected in patients presenting atypical clinical and radiologic CNS manifestations. To our knowledge, this is the first case of PPA in SS.

N2  - Introduction/Purpose. Ataxia is manifested clinically by a widebased unsteady gait, errors of extremity trajectory, errors in motor sequence or rhythm and/or by dysarthria. Tone is usually decreased and stretch reflexes can be "pendular." Nystagmus, skew deviation, disconjugate saccades, and altered ocular pursuit can be present. Ataxia can arise from disorders that involve cerebellum, spinal cord, brain stem, vestibular nuclei, thalamic nuclei, cerebral white matter, cortex, and peripheral sensory nerves. Materials and Methods. Retrospectively reviewed the MRI of patients with ataxia performed in five diffetent centers between 1998 and mid 2011. All MRI were performed on a 1 or 1.5 T system (Siemens or Philips). The MRI protocols consisted of a conventional morphological MR study, in selected cases followed by sequences of perfusion and/or spectroscopy. A selection of the most representative cases of pathology responsible for ataxia is shown. Results. The purpose here is to categorize the disorders that present with ataxia, and to suggest imaging objectives. We include patients with ataxia secondary to vascular lesions localized to the cerebellum, lateral medulla or pons, mesencephalon, red nucleus, thalamic nuclei and posterior limb of the internal capsule, demyelinating disorders, trauma, mass lesions of the posterior fossa, congenital disorders such as Joubert syndrome, rhombencephalosynapsis, hereditary, idiopathic neurodegenarive disorders such as autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, or multi system atrophy, ataxia related to peripheral nerve diseases or to toxic exposure. Conclusion. Disorders causing ataxia are numerous and often uncommon. These entities should be taken into account when studying a patient with ataxia.

N2  - Introduction: We describe the neuroimaging findings in an MRI of a patient with hypoglycemic injury. Patients (or Materials) and Methods: Case Report Results: A 28-year-old man with type I Diabetes on Insulin, presented with 2 years of ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and cognitive impairment. He is known to have bipolar disorder and several suicide attempts with intentional Insulin overdose. Examination revealed repetitive motor behavior with frequent circling of his hands. MRI brain showed T1 hyperintensities predominantly in bilateral basal ganglia and to some extent in pulvinar and dentate nucleus. Susceptibility signals on gradient sequence in the basal ganglia suggested mineralization. Spectroscopy of Brain revealed decreased NAA over the basal ganglia bilaterally with mildly elevated choline suggesting neuronal loss with gliosis (figures on poster). Discussion and Conclusion(s): Etiologies which could cause such hyperintense T1 signals include Neurofibromatosis-1, parenteral nutrition, liver failure, ischemic insult, carbon monoxide poisoning, Wilson's disease, hypoglycemia and various causes of basal ganglia calcification including hyperparathyroidism. In the appropriate clinical background, symmetric and more intense involvement of caudoputamen favor a diagnosis of hypoglycemia, which was confirmed clinically in our patient.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent imaging modality for soft tissues. Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging is an MRI technique that is sensitive to the bound protons of macromolecules and therefore can aid in the assessment of nerve damage. Method(s): Measurements of the MT ratio (MTR), which provides an index of the MT effects in tissues, were performed in the wrist and foot of 5 volunteers. Result(s): The MTR of foot (interdigital) nerves (22.2 +/- 2.1%) was smaller than that of the median nerve (41.1 +/- 1.4%). No difference was observed between MTR in muscles adjacent to foot nerves (46.0 +/- 1.5%) and muscles adjacent to the median nerve (44.2 +/- 1.9%). Conclusion(s): In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the MTR of foot nerves. The difference of MTR between median and foot nerves indicates a difference in structure/composition. The MTR of peripheral nerves may serve as a biomarker of nerve damage, collagen integrity, and demyelination. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - MRI may provide treatment outcome measures in neuromuscular conditions. The authors assessed MRI magnetisation transfer ratios (MTRs) in lower-limb musculature as markers of pathology in peripheral neuropathies and compared the findings with associated clinical data. Ten patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and nine patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) were compared with 10 healthy subjects. The MTR in the calf muscles was significantly lower than controls in the two patient groups (both p<0.001). The median MTRs (IQR) were 50.5(1.6) percentage units (p.u.) (control), 41.5 (10.6) p.u. (CMT1A) and 39.3(8.7) p.u. (CIDP). Moreover, anterior lower leg MTR correlated strongly with strength of ankle dorsiflexion, measured with the Medical Research Council scale, in CIDP (rho=0.88, p<0.001) and also in CMT1A (r=0.50, p<0.05), where MTR also showed an association with disease duration (rho=-0.86, p<0.001). Short tau inversion recovery MRI of the same muscles showed abnormalities associated with regions of reduced MTR (p<0.001), and MTR was also reduced in other muscles otherwise deemed normal appearing (p<0.001), indicating that MTR may be more sensitive to muscle damaged by denervation than conventional MRI. The significant reductions in muscle MTR in peripheral neuropathies and the associated correlations with clinical measures indicate that MTR has potential as an imaging outcome measure in future therapeutic trials.

N2  - The ability to investigate microstructural properties of the central nervous system with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown in many studies. More recently, DTI is being applied outside the brain showing promising results, for instance, for investigating muscle tissue. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography to study the nerves of the sacral plexus in humans in vivo and to assess the architectural configuration and microstructural properties of these peripheral nerves. For this research goal we optimized the acquisition parameters of a DTI sequence and acquired data from 10 healthy adults and one 12-year patient having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. For the healthy volunteers, we estimated the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial diffusivities (RD) of the sacral plexus nerves which may serve as a baseline for future studies. We demonstrated that tractography of the sacral plexus on a 3 Tesla MR scanner is feasible, giving 3D insight in the general anatomy and organization of the nerves L4 to S3. In addition, branches to the pudendal nerve were also found in 4 volunteers. There were no significant differences in any of the estimated diffusion measures between the right and left sided nerves or between the nerves L4 to S3 on an intra-subject basis. Furthermore, clinical feasibility of DTI and tractography in a child having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction is demonstrated. The architectural configuration of the child's sacral plexus was comparable with the healthy volunteers and no significant disrupted nerve fibers were observed. However, there are strong indications that abnormal diffusion characteristics are present at the level of the neural tube defect due to incomplete segments of the nerves that are close to the vertebrae. These findings are encouraging for using DTI as a means to investigate changes in microstructural properties of the nerves of the sacral plexus. Moreover, this new methodology may provide a new avenue to a better analysis and diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunctions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The last few years have seen significant improvements in access to high-quality imaging; modalities and techniques that were once the remit of academic institutions with significant research interests are now accessible to the majority with reduced cost, improved availability and concomitant dissemination of expertise. The trend towards subspecialization has continued in recent years, with a specialist's career choice no longer limited to the pursuit of either a predominantly interventional or diagnostic role. The emergence of those with dedicated expertise in head and neck imaging, paediatric neuroradiology, neuro-ophthalmology, neuro-oncology and stroke is a development that is likely to continue and parallels that which is occurring in body imaging. The objectives of this chapter are to introduce the principal neuroradiological imaging modalities relevant to clinical practice, discuss what each offers and convey their respective limitations. Scenarios in which a given modality is particularly advantageous over others will be discussed as well as the circumstances that preclude the use of certain techniques. The list of modalities discussed is not intended to be exhaustive; the emphasis will be on those that are currently routinely available but novel developments and those currently limited to specialist centres functioning mainly as research tools will also be mentioned briefly. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) is a hereditary dermatological disease in which hypersensitivity to ultraviolet radiation and various neurological symptoms are observed. In this study, to evaluate the degeneration occurring in the brain of XPA patients, neurological examinations by an established neurologist and 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in 10 Japanese XPA patients. MRI studies included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) andmagnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in addition to conventional sequences. Neurological examinations revealed various deteriorations in the both central and peripheral nervous systemsin all subjects. MRI studies demonstrated age-dependent decline in multimodalities. Severe brain atrophy in conventional sequences, decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) value in DTI, and reduced NAA/Cre ratio in MRS were observed in the adult patients. Multimodal MRI studies unmask the neurological deterioration in XPA patients. © 2011 The Authors. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To observe the longitudinal changes of nerve repair in rats after tissue-engineered construct implantation at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to determine whether the enhanced nerve regeneration with use of tissue-engineered constructs could be monitored with gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging or nerve T2 relaxation time measurement. Material(s) and Method(s): All experimental protocols were approved by the institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Tissue-engineered constructs were prepared by seeding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chitosan nerve tubes. Thirty-six rats with sciatic nerve transection injury underwent nerve tube implantation with (n = 18) or without (n = 18) MSC seeding. Sequential T2 measurement, gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging, and sciatic function index measurement were performed over an 8-week follow-up period, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and signal intensity at gadofluorine M-enhanced T1-weighted imaging were measured and were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by the Student-Neuman-Keuls post-hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons. Result(s): Nerve T2 relaxation times and gadofluorine M enhancement, as well as functional changes, showed a similar time course. Nerves implanted with MSC-seeded tubes achieved slightly better functional recovery and enhanced nerve regeneration while showing a slower return to baseline T2 relaxation time and a more rapid decline in gadofluorine M enhancement compared with nerves implanted with chitosan tubes alone. T2 values of the distal portion of transected nerves showed a more rapid return to baseline level than did gadofluorine M enhancement. Conclusion(s): Peripheral nerve repair with use of tissue-engineered constructs can be monitored by using gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and T2 relaxation time measurements. T2 relaxation time seems more sensitive than gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging for detecting nerve regeneration. © RSNA, 2011.

N2  - Objectives To use pre- and post-operative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to monitor median nerve integrity in patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methods Diffusivity and anisotropy images along the median nerve were compared among 12 patients, 12 age-matched and 12 young control subjects and correlated with electrophysiological neurography results. Slice-wise DTI parameter values were calculated to focus on local changes. Results Results of pre-operative patients and age-matched control subjects differed only in the distal nerve. Moreover, pre-operative patients differed significantly from young controls and post-operative patients. The main abnormalities were increased diffusivity and decreased anisotropy in the carpal tunnel and distal median nerve. Post-operative clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but not in anisotropy. Slice-wise analysis showed high pre-operative diffusivity at the distal nerve. All groups had relatively large inter-subject variation in both diffusivity and anisotropy. Conclusions DTI can provide information complementary to clinical examination, electrophysiological recordings and anatomical MRI of diseases and injuries of peripheral nerves. However, similar age-related changes in diffusivity and anisotropy may weaken DTI specificity. Slice-wise analysis is necessary for detection of local changes in nerve integrity. Key Points * Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging provides information complementary to conventional diagnostic methods. * Age caused similar changes to diffusivity and anisotropy as carpal tunnel syndrome. * Post-operative clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but not in anisotropy. * Inter-subject variation in diffusivity and anisotropy was considerable. © European Society of Radiology 2012.

N2  - Purpose: To describe a new semiautomated method for segmenting and measuring the volume of the muscle, bone, and adipose (subcutaneous and intermuscular) tissue in calf muscle compartments using magnetic resonance (MR) images and determine the intrarater and interrater reproducibility of the measures. Material(s) and Method(s): Proton-density weighted MR images were acquired from the right calf of 21 subjects. Three raters segmented and measured the volumes of bones, adipose tissue, and five individual muscle compartments. Two raters repeated the segmentations. The intra- and interrater reproducibility of the measures (intraclass correlation coefficients; ICC) were determined using generalizability theory. Result(s): All ICC values were greater than 0.96. The average standard error of the mean (SEM) of all measures was 1.21 cm3 and none were greater than 2.3 cm3. Essentially all variation (>=97% for all measures) was due to subject differences, indicating low error in the measurements. Conclusion(s): The volumetric measurements for the bones, adipose tissue, and muscle in each of the compartments using MRI were highly reproducible. MRI can provide quantitative, reproducible volumetric measures of bone, adipose tissue, and individual muscle compartments in the calf. We believe these methods can be used to quantify specific muscle or adipose volumetric measures for other clinical or research purposes. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - As with many disorders affecting the central nervous system, treatment of chronic pain is fraught with difficulties related to specific diagnosis and measures of treatment efficacy. Given the recent advances that brain-imaging techniques have contributed to our understanding of how chronic pain affects multiple aspects of brain function (including sensory, emotional, cognitive, and modulatory), opportunities to use these approaches in the clinic are clearly a focus of research laboratories around the world. The routine application of brain imaging as a clinical marker of disease state or therapeutic (drug) efficacy would significantly enhance the clinical process by providing objective measures for clinicians and patients. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - We are developing a simulator of peripheral nerve block utilizing a mixed-reality approach: the combination of a physical model, an MRI-derived virtual model, mechatronics and spatial tracking. Our design uses tangible (physical) interfaces to simulate surface anatomy, haptic feedback during needle insertion, mechatronic display of muscle twitch corresponding to the specific nerve stimulated, and visual and haptic feedback for the injection syringe. The twitch response is calculated incorporating the sensed output of a real neurostimulator. The virtual model is isomorphic with the physical model and is derived from segmented MRI data. This model provides the subsurface anatomy and, combined with electromagnetic tracking of a sham ultrasound probe and a standard nerve block needle, supports simulated ultrasound display and measurement of needle location and proximity to nerves and vessels. The needle tracking and virtual model also support objective performance metrics of needle targeting technique.

N2  - To evaluate the sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. We assessed the changes in the DTI parameters and histological analyses after nerve injury to examine degeneration and regeneration in the rat sciatic nerves. Serial MRI of the right leg was performed at the time points of 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after the crush injury. The changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified. For histological analyses, the number of axons and the myelinated axon areas were quantified. Increased FA and decreased RD were observed in the regenerative phase. The changes in FA and RD were strongly correlated with histological changes, including axonal and myelin regeneration. DTI parameters, especially RD, can be good indicators for peripheral nerve regeneration and can be applied as non-invasive diagnostic tools for a variety of neurological diseases.

N2  - Question: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by mutations of the NF1-gene (17q22.1) and is typically characterized by hyperpigmented patches of the skin (cafe-au-lait spots) and multiple tumors of the peripheral nervous system (neurofibromas). Vascular complications, also summarized as "vascular NF", are less known manifestations of NF1. They most commonly present as hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis. In addition, several case reports describe progressive cerebrovascular occlusions. Here, we present a young NF1 patient with complete obstruction of a carotid artery and discuss whether a progressive vascular occlusion or a congenital vascular dysplasia might be the underlying cause. Method(s): We report on a 14 years old girl with a proven NF1 mutation and clear clinical features of NF1 such as cafe-au-lait spots, freckling as well as several aneurysmatic bone cysts and a tumorous lesion of the brain stem. MRI-controls of this lesion showed a dysplasia of the left internal carotid artery (ACI). The last MRI-control was suspicious of a complete occlusion of the ACI for the first time. For further clarification a MRI-angiography and a Doppler sonography were performed. Result(s): MRI-angiography confirmed the complete occlusion of the left ACI. Compensatory enlargement of the right ACI suggested that cerebral perfusion was at least in part provided through this artery. Doppler sonography of the left external carotid artery revealed a flow profile characteristic of an organ-providing artery. Therefore, additional cerebral perfusion through the left external carotid artery could be presumed. Conclusion(s): Slowly progressive occlusions of vessels-even carotid arteries-as part of a "vascular NF" are a well described but still unclear phenomenon. Our imaging results are suggestive of a congenital dysplasia with compensatory formation of a collateral circulation. In that case the remaining lumen of the left ACI that was documented in earlier examinations might have been a misinterpretation since this question was not the focus of the examination.

N2  - Introduction: There were sporadic case reports about recovery from persistent vegetative state after infusion of baclofen intrathecally. We present our experience of two patients who were improved their consciousness only after intrathecal infusion of baclofen with trial dose. Material(s) and Method(s): Baclofen (Lioresal) was infused intrathecally to the two patients who were persistent vegetative state for more than 6 months after traumatic brain injury. Only trial dosage, 50, 75, and 100 microgram were used, and we measured JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRSR), SSEP, EMG, functional MR, perfusion CT with video record before and after infusion. Result(s): Case 1: This 33-year-old female patient was transferred from other hospital after traumatic brain injury. Her mentality was deep stuporous, with occasional nonpurposeful movement and visual fi xation, which was compatible with vegetative state. Her vegetative state was lasted 6 months after trauma, so we recommended intrathecal baclofen infusion trial for controlling spasticity. Her spasticity was responded to Lioresal and her recovery of consciousness was prominent, CRS-R improved from 4 to 11 immediate after trial period. And this phenomenon was lasted till in our hospital but without more improvement. Discussion(s): There were some eff orts to recover the patients with unconsciousness in the fi eld of functional neurosurgery, such as using deep brain stimulation or spinal cord stimulation. Intrathecal baclofen infusion also showed improvement in unconscious patients in some cases. There are some hypotheses of baclofen eff ect; modulating neuronal centripetal outputs, sleep-wake cycle modulation, and improving axonal conduction. But in our cases, we could not demonstrate these hypotheses. And in trauma patient, the extent of injury is not uniformed which will be problematic to choose this kind of trial. Conclusion(s): There are only few reports, and the protocol of baclofen infusion is not verifi ed. Also the mechanism of baclofen on recovery from vegetative state is not explained. Systemic trials are needed to establish the eff ectiveness of intrathecal baclofen in recovery of consciousness.

N2  - Background: The spectrum of acute antibody mediated conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system includes a number of conditions, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). There is evidence that the mechanism of GBS, particularly the acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant and of MFS involves the production of antibodies to gangliosides and ganglioside complexes, induced by Campylobacter jejuni infection, and considered as a true case of molecular mimicry. It is therefore not surprising that the symptoms of GBS and MFS may overlap. Here, we present a case where the two conditions occurred sequentially. Patient(s): A 39-year-old male patient, following an episode of diarrhoea, presented with severe bilateral ophthalmoparesis, ataxia, areflexia, and dysarthria, highly suggestive of MFS. The diagnosis was supported by auxiliary examinations: MRI of the brain was normal, cerebrospinal fluid examination showed mildly elevated protein content (0.75g/L), and nerve conduction studies revealed low amplitude sensory potentials. Final confirmation was given by the detection of anti-GQ1b antibodies in the serum. The patient underwent a course of plasma exchange therapy, and after an initial worsening (appearance of facial palsy) recovered within 6 weeks. Fourteen years earlier, this patient was diagnosed with GBS, when he experienced an acute onset of weakness in his legs. He recovered completely. Conclusion(s): This case demonstrates that GBS may recur in the same patient, although in its MFS variant. It is speculated that susceptibility to GBS or its variants is increased in certain individuals, perhaps related to their particular ganglioside makeup.

N2  - Introduction: Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) of peripheral nerves is a new technique to evaluate tissue changes after injury. This study demonstrates the feasibility and clinical application of this technique in the preoperative assessment of traumatic brachial plexus injuries (BPI). Method(s): Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging was performed in a total of 80 brachial plexus in 10 healthy volunteers and 30 patients with BPI. 60 DTI slices were acquired in the axial plane (slice thickness 2. 7mm, b values = 0 and 900 s/mm2, and 64 gradient directions). FA, ADC maps and tensor calculation were performed in-line by the MRI scanner. DTI fiber tracks were calculated and analyzed. All patients underwent physical examination and electrophysiological testing. Intraoperative findings were correlated with diagnostic results to evaluate the accuracy. Result(s): In all volunteers the roots C5, C6, C7 brachial plexus were clearly identified on DTT, however in C8 and Th1 the nerve course could be only inconsistently reconstructed. In 23 patients DTT showed a significant asymmetry between the injured and the healthy contralateral brachial plexus. Surgical exploration confirmed the preoperative MRI findings in all patients. Supraclavicular BPI could be correctly excluded in 4 patients. Conclusion(s): DTT is technical feasible for the evaluation of postganglionic lesions of BPI with high accuracy at the level of C5, C6, and C7. It reveals an insight into microstructural organisation of peripheral nerves and allows distinction of unaffected nerve tissue and neuroma. Thus, DTT has promising potential in the evaluation and monitoring of BPI.

N2  - Serious injuries to the peripheral nerves often result from civilian and combat trauma. The patients with traumatic nerve injuries are left with significant disability and morbidity. There is an acute need for reliable measures to monitor nerve injury and repair to make informed management decisions in clinic. Currently, noninvasive techniques that allow early assessment of regeneration in traumatic nerve injuries are not available in clinical practice. We are developing magnetic resonance (MR) based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technology, to monitor the degenerative and regenerative response in patients with traumatic nerve injuries. We hypothesize that alterations in DTI parameters can detect nerve fiber degeneration and regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we have studied seven normal controls and four patients with complete (Sunderland grade V) traumatic nerve injuries of median and ulnar nerves in the forearm. All the patients with traumatic neuropathies had surgical repair of injured nerves, underwent clinical, electrophysiologic, and MRI/DTI studies. MRI sequences included T1- and T2-weighted (SPAIR with fat sat), STIR, and DWI. The fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were generated and the longitudinal and radial diffusivities were quantified. We found that FA maps delineate the forearm nerves much more clearly than other sequences. FA values for uninjured median and ulnar nerves were 0.75 +/- 0.03 and 0.71 +/- 0.04, respectively, and did not change significantly along the length of the nerve. Imaging of the injured nerves showed that the highest FA values were seen in the proximal stump of the repaired nerves. The denervated distal stumps of the injured nerves had dramatic changes in the DTI derived measures. Nerve segments adjacent to repair site undergoing reinnervation had increased FA compared to the completely denervated caudal segments of distal stump. These findings show the potential role of DTI as a quantitative and useful technology in assessing degeneration and regeneration in traumatic nerve injuries.

N2  - MRI imaging is a very useful tool in peripheral nerve disorders investigation. Different MRI image regimens can be used for structural nerve study. With special fiber tracking software, it is possible to visualize neural tracts with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. There are few studies in which peripheral nerves have been visualized with DTI. Our objective is to characterize nerve trunk abnormalities according to tractography in different nerve diseases. All patients were submitted to conventional MRI in a 3 Tesla scanner (Siemens Magnetom Trio Tim, Erlangen, Germany) including T1 (TR:590, TE:21), T2 SPACE 3D (TR:1500, TE:162), STIR (TR:5340, TE:68, TI:200) and fat-saturated proton density with pulse restore (TR:1980, TE:39) weighted images. To provide morphological study of the nerve and diffusion-weighted, echo planar imaging (EPI, b = 900) pulse sequence was done in the axial plane, through 8.5 cm of the nerve and the values of the fractional anisotropy and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were obtained. Case 1: A 38y.o. male had a multifocal inflammatory neuropathy. Diffusion-weighted images in the elbow showed thickening of the ulnar nerves with hyperintense signal in proton density images. Case 2: A 42 y.o. female presented bilateral ulnar neuropathy due to leprosy. Tractography in the bilateral ulnar nerve had normal aspect on conventional images. Case 3: A 35 y.o. female with severe wrist pain after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome; the wrist and the median nerve was studied and presented normal on conventional images. Case 4: A 52y.o. male with demyelinating multifocal features performed images throughout the entire sciatic nerves. There was moderate thickening in the proximal segment, with hyperintense signal in STIR images. Axial proton density fat-saturated images of the left leg showed hyperintense signal in the hallucis flexor longus muscle, indicative of denervation. Case 5: A 45 y.o. man with traumatic ulnar neuropathy. CB was depicted in this nerve at the elbow. Tractography revealed an enlarged ulnar nerve due to edema. Tractography can be used to image and visualize peripheral nerves. It could provide useful information for diagnosis and follow-up of nerve lesions, including entrapments, inflammatory processes, hypertrophic inherited disorders, edema and regeneration.

N2  - As potential treatments become available for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1A (CMT1A), accurate ways to measure disease progression are needed to test treatment efficacy. The 'three-point Dixon' fat/water separation method is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to measure the proportion of fat within a given tissue. We performed lower limb MRI including three-point Dixon sequences of the mid calf of 14 patients with genetically confirmed CMT1Aand 16 healthy volunteers. We also performed isometric myometry (CSMi HUMAC Norm Testing System) of ankle plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion and eversion. Mean muscle fat percentage was increased in CMT1A patients compared with controls in all muscles assessed: tibialis anterior 18.4% vs. 1.3%, peroneus longus 21.2% vs. 2.8%, lateral gastrocnemius 14.4% vs. 1.8%, medial gastrocnemius 16.9% vs. 2.3%, soleus 14.0% vs. 2.6%, tibialis posterior 14.6% vs. 1.5%. Five CMT1A patients had fat percentages within the normal range for all muscles, whereas 2 had greater than 50% fat in all muscles. Of the 7 patients with abnormalities of some muscles only, peroneus longus and tibialis anterior were most commonly involved. There was good correlation between quantitative fat measurements and qualitative assessments of T1-weighted images. Correlation between muscle fat and ankle strength was calculated in CMT1A patients using Spearman rank correlation: tibialis anterior and ankle dorsiflexion: rho = -0.55, p < 0.001, ankle plantarflexors (soleus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius) and ankle plantarflexion: rho = -0.64, p< 0.001, peroneus longus and ankle eversion: rho = -0.641, p = 0.001, tibialis posterior and ankle inversion rho = -0.084, p = 0.70. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that calf muscle fat in patients with CMT1A is increased compared with healthy volunteers with tibialis anterior and peroneus longus preferentially involved. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between muscle weakness and muscle fat. Quantitative muscle fat measurement using MRI may be useful as an outcome measure in CMT1A.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of the work is to investigate the blood oxygenation level dependent activation during somatosensory electrical stimulation of median nerve in acute stroke patients and to define the correlation with ischemic damage (anatomical images) and with the clinical recovery over time. Method(s): Fourteen acute stroke patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during contralesional median-nerve electrical stimulation with 3T Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner (MAGNETOM Allegra, Siemens) from 12 to 48 hours after stroke. A new method to measure the haemodynamic reponse in stroke patients was studied. Diffusion tensor imaging and motor evoked potential by Transcranial magnetic stimulation were also acquired to validate the findings. Different clinical scales as National Institute of Health scale, Barthel index, European Stroke Scale, tactile-thermal scale, and Kinesthetic Sensitivity Test at the time of fMRI recording (t0), one month after stroke (t1), and four-five months after stroke (t2) were measured. Result(s): Four patients with no fMRI activation during somatosensory stimulation in the early days after stroke had bad clinical recovery after three months, whereas eight patients with a normal activation pattern in primary sensory motor area in acute phase had good clinical recovery. Two patients showed low correlation between bold activation and clinical recovery. TMS and DTI were partially correlated with clinical recovery and fMRI findings. Conclusion(s): Stimulation of peripheral nerve during the functional magnetic resonance imaging provide important clinical insights on the "functional reserve" in patients affected by stroke wityh an important prognostic value already in the acute period of cerebrovascular accident.

N2  - Purpose: Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder associated with the frequent occurrence of central and peripheral nervous system tumors [1]. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) are one of the hallmarks of NF1. These are peripheral nerve sheath tumors which consist of (Figure presented) proliferation of cells in the nerve sheath, extending along the length of the nerve and involving multiple nerve fascicles [2]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the method of choice for noninvasive assessment of tumors, as it plays an essential role in classification and grading, preoperative evaluation, follow-up, and therapeutic management. The scan protocol of MRI consists of several conventional and advanced pulse sequences. STIR (Short-T1 Inversion Recovery) is the common pulse sequence to detect and characterize PN. In this paper, we present a new method for segmentation of PN from STIR MRI scan. The method utilizes a user-based initial delineation of the tumor area in a single slice to automatically detect the PN lesions in the entire image. Our method requires less user initialization for the segmentation process, most of the segmentation is performed automatically. Method(s): The method consists of five steps: * PN Region of interest selection-the user is required to coarsely delineate the lesions area in a single slice. * Slices intensity normalization-The higher intensity values of every slice in the image are normalized with the higher intensity values of a selected slice. * Automatic tumor detection in a single slice-The PN pixels in each slice are automatically detected with histogram-based analysis on the selected ROI using a previously published method [3]. * 3D region growing-Based on the unique nature of this specific tumor, the segmentation results of the previous step propagates to the other slices in the image automatically. * Manual adjustment-the user manually eliminates or adds certain areas in the image to the final PNs segmentation. Figure 1 illustrates the steps of our method. Result(s): The method was tested on seven datasets with PN lesions. We performed two studies: in the first study, we examined the total segmentation time and accuracy of our method. This study yields a mean volume overlap difference of 25% as compared to manual segmentation by expert radiologist. The average computation time of our method including the manual user interaction time was 12 min. In contrast, the mean manual annotation time exceeds one hour. In the second study, we performed an analysis of the resulted overlap error versus the user interaction time invested by the user. As a result we obtained that approximately 5 min of user interaction are required to achieve a volume overlap error less than 25%. Figure 2 shows the segmentation results of our method versus manual segmentation results. Conclusion(s): We have presented a new method for the semi-automatic segmentation of PN lesions in STIR MR images. The current manual segmentation of PNs is time consuming, error prone and may require several hours for a single dataset. Our method is unique in that it requires less user interaction than manual or other semi-automatic PN (Figure presented) segmentation methods. The proposed segmentation method is much more user friendly. An analysis of the performance of the method versus the manual user interaction time leads to the conclusion that only several minutes of user interaction are required to obtain a reliable PN segmentation. In the future, we plan to extend the method to handle also whole-body STIR scans and to add the FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) pulse sequence to eliminate the CSF and other cystic regions. This process will improve our results and reduce the false-positive errors of our method.

N2  - Introduction Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) are severe infections which are often caused by methicillin resistant Staphylococci (MRS). The management of this type of infections include adequate and longterm treatment with antibiotics. PJI caused by MRS are usually treated with vancomycin during hospitalization. As soon as the patient is discharged, vancomycin can be switched into oral linezolid, if susceptibility is proven. Since linezolid is very expensive and associated with some toxicity, especially during long-term treatment, we were interested in evaluating minocycline as an alternative option for treating PJI caused by MRS. Materials & Methods Case report, analysis based on clinical data and literature review. Results A 82-year old man, who presented earlier with loosening, luxation and infection of a total hip prosthesis, was admitted for revision of the prosthesis. Upon admission, physical examination revealed pain and redness, laboratory findings confirmed inflammation. A X-ray of the hip showed loosening of the prosthesis. Perioperative wound cultures showed MR-Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin was started (1g tid) and adequate plasma levels were achieved. After 6 weeks of treatment, the patient was ready to be discharged from the hospital. As the guidelines for treatment of PJI advice to treat for a total duration of 3 months, an oral antimicrobial agent was needed to continue his treatment. Since recently, linezolid is an attractive option in this setting, as it is characterized by potent in vitro activity against MRS and a good penetration in bone and biofilms. However, because of its high cost and potential toxicity, such as pancytopenia, lactic acidosis and peripheral neuropathy, long-term treatment with linezolid is not always straightforward. Minocyclin, for which susceptibility was also documented in our patient, was therefore evaluated as alternative. Minocycline has significant in vitro activity against Staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains. Moreover, this tetracycline was shown to accumulate in bone and is highly active against MRSA isolates embedded in biofilms, suggesting a good bone and biofilm penetration.1 In general, minocyline has a low toxicity profile, only liver function tests should be followed up. Moreover, it is 60 times less expensive than linezolid. The patient was discharged with minocycline 100 mg bid. The patient is doing well, signs and symptoms of infection completely disappeared. Discussion & Conclusion Minocycline, a safe and cheap antibiotic, can be used as an alternative for linezolid in the prolonged treatment for prosthetic joint infections caused by methicillin resistant Staphylococci. More research should be undertaken to explore the role of this old drug in shortening intravenous vancomycin administration and consequently length of stay in patients with prosthetic joint infections caused by resistant Gram positive strains.

N2  - The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a newly (in 2001) discovered late-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by a premutation in the FMR1 X-linked gene. FXTAS is characterized by progressive intention tremor and gait ataxia, with more variable associated features of parkinsonism, dysautonomia, peripheral neuropathy and dementia. In the literature there are a few reports of FXTAS. We report a second case in Poland. Case report: 59-year-old man, with hypertension, has suffered from rest tremor of a right upper limb since 4 months. His grandchild has been diagnosed with fragile X syndrome. On admission to the Neurological Department of Medical University in Wroclaw he presented extra-pyramidal signs: masked face, postural and right upper limb muscles rigidity, rest tremor of a right upper limb; there were no evidence of ataxia, pyramidal signs or sphincter disturbances. Conventional brain MRI showed mild cerebellar atrophy, symmetric high signals in the middle cerebellar peduncles (MPC sign). In perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) hypoperfusion in the middle cerebellar peduncles was revealed, while damage of white matter in MPC and in the internal capsule was seen in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Surface electromyography (EMG) revealed rest tremor with frequency of 5 Hz, without other, important electrophysiologic findings. The diagnosis of FXTAS was confirmed by genetic test. Discussion(s): Although our patient showed only small clinical criteria of FXTAS, the diagnosis was based on a big, neuroradiological criteria as well as genetic findings. The authors indicate to themeaning of radiological diagnostics in the FXTAS recognition.

N2  - The majority of nerve fibers in the spinal cord run longitudinally, playing an important role in connecting the brain to the peripheral nerves. There is a growing interest in applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to the evaluation of spinal cord microarchitecture. The current study sought to compare the organization of longitudinal nerve fibers between healthy and myelopathic spinal cords using entropy-based analysis of principal eigenvector mapping. A total of 22 subjects were recruited, including 14 healthy subjects, seven cervical myelopathy (CM) patients with single-level compression, and one patient suffering from multi-level compression. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (MR) images of the cervical spinal cord were obtained using a pulsed gradient, spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence with a 3T MR system. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually to cover the spinal cord, and Shannon entropy was calculated in principal eigenvector maps. The results revealed no significant differences in orientation entropy values along the whole length of cervical spinal cord in healthy subjects (C2-3: 0.73 +/- 0.05; C3-4: 0.71 +/- 0.07; C4-5: 0.72 +/- 0.048; C5-6: 0.71 +/- 0.07; C6-7: 0.72 +/- 0.07). In contrast, orientation entropy values in myelopathic cord were significantly higher at the compression site (0.91 +/- 0.03), and the adjacent levels (above: 0.85 +/- 0.03; below: 0.83 +/- 0.05). This study provides a novel approach to analyze the orientation information in diffusion MR images of healthy and diseased spinal cord. These results indicate that orientation entropy can be applied to determine the contribution of each compression level to the overall disorganization of principal nerve tracts of myelopathic spinal cord in cases with multi-level compression. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Among the neoplastic conditions that affect patients with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) are malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which typically arise from peripheral nerves of the limbs, trunk, and lumbar and brachial plexuses. Ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for MPNST development, especially in susceptible patients such as those with NF1. Patients with NF1 are also at risk for intracranial aneurysms, which are increasingly being successfully managed with endovascular therapies. The authors describe the case of a 9-year-old, previously healthy girl who presented in extremis with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage resulting from a ruptured right middle cerebral artery (MCA) trifurcation aneurysm. Following urgent decompressive craniectomy, the patient underwent endovascular coil embolization of the MCA aneurysm without complication. Given her mother's history of NF1, the child underwent genetic testing, which disclosed signs positive for NF1. The patient recovered well, but follow-up MR imaging and MR angiography performed at 14 months demonstrated a large frontotemporal mass encasing the right MCA trifurcation. The patient underwent frontotemporal craniotomy and subtotal resection of the mass, which was histologically found to be an intracranial MPNST. The patient received chemotherapy and focal radiation therapy and remains alive at 6 months postresection. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the only known case of intracranial neoplasm arising in the region of an intracranial aneurysm repaired by endovascular coil embolization. While patients with NF1 represent a population with genetic susceptibility to radiation-induced tumors, the pathogenesis of intracerebral MPNSTs remains poorly understood.

N2  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the evaluation of peripheral nerves in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Method(s): Using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, we obtained DTI scans of the tibial nerves of 10 CIDP patients and 10 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. We prepared fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, measured the FA values of tibial nerves, and compared these values in the two study groups. In nine patients, we also performed tibial nerve conduction studies and analyzed the correlation between the FA values and parameters of the nerve conduction study. Result(s): The tibial nerve FA values in CIDP patients (median 0.401, range 0.312-0.510) were significantly lower than those in healthy volunteers (median 0.530, range 0.469-0.647) (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.01). They were significantly correlated with the amplitude of action potential (Spearman correlation coefficient, p=0.04, r=0.86) but not with nerve conduction velocity (p=0.79, r=0.11). Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data suggest that the noninvasive DTI assessment of peripheral nerves may provide useful information in patients with CIDP. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Various neurological problems of the brain are known to occur in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings in patients with ESRD. Using DTI, we attempted to investigate DTI findings in patients with ESRD who showed no specific lesions on conventional brain MRI. We recruited 10 consecutive patients with ESRD for whom at least 3 years had passed since the start of peritoneal dialysis and who showed no neurological abnormality on neurologic examination. We excluded 6 patients who showed cerebral infarct (4 patients) and diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy (2 patients); finally, 4 patients (39.75 +/- 9.84 years) were included in this study. We evaluated hand motor function and cognition. DTI data were acquired using a 1.5-T Philips Gyroscan Intera system and diffusion tensor tractographies (DTTs) for five neural tracts (corticospinal tract, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus) were evaluated. With the exception of 1 patient who revealed a mild abnormality at a higher cognitive function, no abnormalities in motor and cognitive function were observed. Among the 10 DTTs, except for those of the corticospinal tract, all 4 patients had more than one lesion. Patients with ESRD showed abnormalities on DTTs that were associated with cognition; however, they did not show significant cognitive abnormalities. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) neurography in children, and the potential roles of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fiber-tracking (FT) techniques. Method(s): Five pediatric patients (age range: 6-12 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for various clinical indications: neurogenic bladder (case 1); persistent hand pain following minor trauma (case 2); progressive atrophy of the lower left extremity muscles (case 3); bilateral hip pain (case 4); and palpable left supraclavicular mass (case 5). All studies were performed using a 1.5-T Avanto MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The protocol included 3D T2-weighted STIR and SPACE imaging, T1-weighted fat-saturation post-gadolinium imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tractography. ADC (Nx10-3 mm2/s) and FA values were calculated from regions of interest (ROIs) centered on the nerves. Nerve-fiber tracks were calculated using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (NeuroD software). Result(s): MR neurography allowed satisfactory visualization of all neural structures, and FA and ADC measurements were feasible. The final diagnoses were Tarlov cysts, median-nerve compression, sciatic perineurioma, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and plexiform neurofibroma in a patient with NF-1. Discussion(s): FA and ADC measurements are of little value because of the lack of normal reference values. Nerve-fiber tractography (FT) may be of value in the characterization of tumor pathology, and is also helpful in the planning of surgical treatments. Conclusion(s): MR neurography is feasible in pediatric patients. However, a considerable amount of work has yet to be done to establish its role in the clinical management of the wide range of peripheral nerve diseases. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking is used for 3-dimensional visualization of the nervous system. Peripheral nerves and all cranial nerves, except for the olfactory tract, have previously been visualized. The olfactory tracts are difficult to depict with diffusion-weighted imaging due to the high sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts at the base of the skull. Here we report an optimized single-shot diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence that can visualize the olfactory tracts with fiber tracking. Five healthy individuals were examined, and the olfactory tracts could be fiber tracked with the diffusion-weighted sequence. For comparison and as a negative control, an anosmic patient was examined. No olfactory tracts were visualized on T2-weighted nor diffusion-weighted fiber tracking images. Measuring diffusion in the olfactory tracts promise to facilitate the identification of different hyposmic and anosmic conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Diabetic neuropathy is a chronic and often disabling condition that affects a significant number of individuals with diabetes. Long considered a disease of the peripheral nervous system, there is now increasing evidence of central nervous system involvement. Recent advances in neuroimaging methods detailed in this review have led to a better understanding and refinement of how diabetic neuropathy affects the central nervous system. Recognition that diabetic neuropathy is, in part, a disease that affects the whole nervous system is resulting in a critical rethinking of this disorder, opening a new direction for further research. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Measurements of the cross sectional area of the sciatic nerve are described in a group of 10 patients with genetically confirmed Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), nine patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and 10 healthy controls using MRI. One mid-thigh of each individual was imaged using a short tau inversion recovery sequence and the nerve appearance evaluated radiologically with respect to the signal intensity and visibility of the internal neural structure. The cross sectional area of the sciatic nerve of each individual was measured by defining irregular enclosing regions of interest on the MRI images. The sciatic nerve area was enlarged in both CMT1A (p<0.001) and CIDP (p=0.008) compared with controls and in CMT1A compared with CIDP (p<0.001). Median (interquartile range) areas were 67.6 (16.2) mm2 for the CIDP group, 135.9 (46.5) mm2for the CMT1A group and 43.3 (19.9) mm2 for the control group. The critical upper value for discriminating pathologically enlarged nerves from normal controls with p<0.05 was 64.4 mm2. Quantification of sciatic nerve hypertrophy on MRI may be of assistance in cases where the diagnosis is still in doubt, providing an objective pathological marker complimenting other clinical investigations.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. We assessed the changes in the DTI parameters and histological analyses after nerve injury to examine degeneration and regeneration in the rat sciatic nerves. Material(s) and Method(s): For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 16 rats were randomly divided into two groups: group P (permanently crushed; n = 7) and group T (temporally crushed; n = 9). Serial MRI of the right leg was performed before the operation, and then performed at the timepoints of 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the crush injury. The changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (lambda ), and radial diffusivity (lambda) were quantified. For histological analyses, the number of axons and the myelinated axon areas were quantified. Result(s): Decreased FA and increased lambda were observed in the degenerative phase, and increased FA and decreased lambda were observed in the regenerative phase. The changes in FA and lambda were strongly correlated with histological changes, including axonal and myelin regeneration. Conclusion(s): DTI parameters, especially lambda, can be good indicators for peripheral nerve regeneration and can be applied as noninvasive diagnostic tools for a variety of neurological diseases. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Damage to the peripheral nervous system is surprisingly common and occurs primarily from trauma or a complication of surgery. Although recovery of nerve function occurs in many mild injuries, outcomes are often unsatisfactory following severe trauma. Nerve repair and regeneration presents unique clinical challenges and opportunities, and substantial contributions can be made through the informed application of biomedical engineering strategies. This article reviews the clinical presentations and classification of nerve injuries, in addition to the state of the art for surgical decision-making and repair strategies. This discussion presents specific challenges that must be addressed to realistically improve the treatment of nerve injuries and promote widespread recovery. In particular, nerve defects a few centimeters in length use a sensory nerve autograft as the standard technique; however, this approach is limited by the availability of donor nerve and comorbidity associated with additional surgery. Moreover, we currently have an inadequate ability to noninvasively assess the degree of nerve injury and to track axonal regeneration. As a result, wait-and-see surgical decisions can lead to undesirable and less successful "delayed" repair procedures. In this fight for time, degeneration of the distal nerve support structure and target progresses, ultimately blunting complete functional recovery. Thus, the most pressing challenges in peripheral nerve repair include the development of tissue-engineered nerve grafts that match or exceed the performance of autografts, the ability to noninvasively assess nerve damage and track axonal regeneration, and approaches to maintain the efficacy of the distal pathway and targets during the regenerative process. Biomedical engineering strategies can address these issues to substantially contribute at both the basic and applied levels, improving surgical management and functional recovery following severe peripheral nerve injury. © 2011 by Begell House, Inc.

N2  - Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by infantile onset and rapid progression of psychomotor regression and hypotonia evolving into spasticity. The neuroradiologic hallmark of the disease is represented by progressive cerebellar atrophy. Prior to the discovery of mutations in the PLA2G6 gene in family with INAD, the clinical diagnosis of the disease had been confirmed by the presence of spheroid bodies (SB) in a peripheral nerve biopsy. Various studies have found that some patients with mutations lacked SB and some without mutations had SB, indicating incomplete detection using either pathologic or molecular methods7. This, together with the observation that the spectrum of clinical features associated with mutations in PLA2G6 is broader than previously described, has increased the usefulness of Magnetic Resonance (MR) in INAD diagnosis, particularly in the frequent occurrence of atypical cases, especially in the early stages of the disease. We retrospectively reviewed the MR studies of eight patients in whom clinical and imaging onset met the typical criteria for INAD. Their clinical and MR imaging (MRI) onset and follow-up were evaluated together with the neuroradiological findings reported in the literature in order to identify MRI features useful in differentiating INAD from other diseases with similar clinical onset and to discuss which of them are the most important, thus suggesting INAD diagnosis. Our contribution included the use of Proton Spectroscopy (1H-MR), diffusion weighted MR imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the follow-up of seven of the eight patients. The literature reviewed included attempts to correlate clinical and MR data with the genotype in the group of patients carrying PLA2G6 mutations. From the limited and inhomogeneous cohort of patients included in our study, a correlation between the MR features, phenotype and genotype was not exhaustive.

N2  - High-resolution ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the two imaging methods of choice for the study of peripheral nerves. The many advances that have been made in recent years, either by US or MR imaging, including diffusion tensor imaging and tractography, offer new perspectives for the assessment of many pathological processes affecting peripheral nerves such as entrapment syndromes, tumors and tumor-like lesions, and traumatic disorders. Most of these improvements have especially increased the spatial resolution of nerve imaging. US and MR imaging are complementary, each having advantages and disadvantages. Tractography is still emerging in the musculoskeletal field, particularly for the analysis of peripheral nerves, but this technique seems promising. © Thieme Medical Publishers.

N2  - Background. Functional assessments of the heart by dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) commonly rely on (i) electrocardiographic (ECG) gating yielding pseudo real-time cine representations, (ii) balanced gradient-echo sequences referred to as steady-state free precession (SSFP), and (iii) breath holding or respiratory gating. Problems may therefore be due to the need for a robust ECG signal, the occurrence of arrhythmia and beat to beat variations, technical instabilities (e.g., SSFP "banding" artefacts), and limited patient compliance and comfort. Here we describe a new approach providing true real-time CMR with image acquisition times as short as 20 to 30 ms or rates of 30 to 50 frames per second. Methods. The approach relies on a previously developed real-time MR method, which combines a strongly undersampled radial FLASH CMR sequence with image reconstruction by regularized nonlinear inversion. While iterative reconstructions are currently performed offline due to limited computer speed, online monitoring during scanning is accomplished using gridding reconstructions with a sliding window at the same frame rate but with lower image quality. Results. Scans of healthy young subjects were performed at 3 T without ECG gating and during free breathing. The resulting images yield T1 contrast (depending on flip angle) with an opposed-phase or in-phase condition for water and fat signals (depending on echo time). They completely avoid (i) susceptibility-induced artefacts due to the very short echo times, (ii) radiofrequency power limitations due to excitations with flip angles of 10degree or less, and (iii) the risk of peripheral nerve stimulation due to the use of normal gradient switching modes. For a section thickness of 8 mm, real-time images offer a spatial resolution and total acquisition time of 1.5 mm at 30 ms and 2.0 mm at 22 ms, respectively. Conclusions. Though awaiting thorough clinical evaluation, this work describes a robust and flexible acquisition and reconstruction technique for real-time CMR at the ultimate limit of this technology. © 2010 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background. The safe performance of regional anaesthesia (RA) requires theoretical knowledge and good manual skills. Virtual reality (VR)-based simulators may offer trainees a safe environment to learn and practice different techniques. However, currently available VR simulators do not consider individual anatomy, which limits their use for realistic training. We have developed a VR-based simulator that can be used for individual anatomy and for different anatomical regions. Methods. Individual data were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) without contrast agent to represent morphology and the vascular system, respectively. For data handling, registration, and segmentation, an application based on the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit was developed. Suitable segmentation algorithms such as the fuzzy c-means clustering approach were integrated, and a hierarchical tree data structure was created to model the flexible anatomical structures of peripheral nerve cords. The simulator was implemented in the VR toolkit ViSTA using modules for collision detection, virtual humanoids, interaction, and visualization. A novel algorithm for electric impulse transmission is the core of the simulation. Results. In a feasibility study, MRI morphology and MRA were acquired from five subjects for the inguinal region. From these sources, three-dimensional anatomical data sets were created and nerves modelled. The resolution obtained from both MRI and MRA was sufficient for realistic simulations. Our high-fidelity simulator application allows trainees to perform virtual peripheral nerve blocks based on these data sets and models. Conclusions. Subject-specific training of RA is supported in a virtual environment. We have adapted segmentation algorithms and developed a VR-based simulator for the inguinal region for use in training for different peripheral nerve blocks. In contrast to available VR-based simulators, our simulation offers anatomical variety.

N2  - Following upper limb peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair, some patients regain good sensorimotor function while others do not. Understanding peripheral and central mechanisms that contribute to recovery may facilitate the development of new therapeutic interventions. Plasticity following peripheral nerve transection has been demonstrated throughout the neuroaxis in animal models of nerve injury. However, the brain changes that occur following peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair in humans have not been examined. Furthermore, the extent to which peripheral nerve regeneration influences functional and structural brain changes has not been characterized. Therefore, we asked whether functional changes are accompanied by grey and/or white matter structural changes and whether these changes relate to sensory recovery? To address these key issues we (i) assessed peripheral nerve regeneration; (ii) measured functional magnetic resonance imaging brain activation (blood oxygen level dependent signal; BOLD) in response to a vibrotactile stimulus; (iii) examined grey and white matter structural brain plasticity; and (iv) correlated sensory recovery measures with grey matter changes in peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair patients. Compared to each patient's healthy contralesional nerve, transected nerves have impaired nerve conduction 1.5 years after transection and repair, conducting with decreased amplitude and increased latency. Compared to healthy controls, peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair patients had altered blood oxygen level dependent signal activity in the contralesional primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, and in a set of brain areas known as the 'task positive network'. In addition, grey matter reductions were identified in several brain areas, including the contralesional primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, in the same areas where blood oxygen level dependent signal reductions were identified. Furthermore, grey matter thinning in the post-central gyrus was negatively correlated with measures of sensory recovery (mechanical and vibration detection) demonstrating a clear link between function and structure. Finally, we identified reduced white matter fractional anisotropy in the right insula in a region that also demonstrated reduced grey matter. These results provide insight into brain plasticity and structure-function-behavioural relationships following nerve injury and have important therapeutic implications.

N2  - Results: Involvement of the central nervous system in diabetic sensorimotor neuropathy (DN) is being increasingly recognised. We have previously demonstrated the presence of spinal cord atrophy not only in subjects with established-DN but also in early, subclinical DSP. In a further proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H+MRS) study, subjects with established-DN were found to exhibit thalamic neuronal dysfunction. In this study we looked at the relationship between spinal cord atrophy and thalamic neuronal function in DSP. METHOD(S): Twenty subjects [6 healthy volunteers; 14 diabetic subjects (8 No-DN and 6 Established-DN)] underwent detailed assessment of peripheral nerve function including: neuropathic symptom evaluation, clinical examination to determine the Neuropathy Impairment Score of Lower Limbs (NIS[LL]), 5 attributes of nerve electrophysiology, vibration detection threshold and heart rate with deep breathing test. MR imaging of the cervical spine and thalamic H-MRS were conducted within one year. Cervical cord cross-sectional area at disc level C2/C3 was calculated. Established markers of neuronal function [N-acetyl aspartate:choline (NA:Cho)] were obtained from the thalamus using long echo time H+MRS. RESULT(S): Subjects with Established-DN had significant reduction in both cervical cord area [ANOVA p=0.002; Established-DN mean(SD) 52.1(4.1) vs No-DSP 68.8(8.20), p=0.001 and Established-DN vs HV 68.7(10.4), p=0.002] and thalamic NA:Cho [ANOVA p=0.013; Established-DN 1.58(0.16) vs No-DN 1.80(0.15) and Established-DN vs HV 1.74(1.0)] compared to the other groups. Among subjects with diabetes, cervicalcord area was significantly related to thalamic NA:Cho (r=0.42, p=0.04). CONCLUSION(S): Diabetic subjects with Established-DN had the greatest level of spinal cord atrophy and thalamic neuronal dysfunction compared those with No-DN and HV. Significant positive correlations between spinal cord area and thalamic NA:Cho suggest progressive, concomitant involvement of the central nervous system in DN. Diabetes is a metabolic/vascular disorder and its insult on the nervous system appears more generalised, involving both the peripheral and central nervous systems.

N2  - Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial childhood solid tumour, accounting for between 7-10% of paediatric cancers, and originates in peripheral nerve tissues. The proto-oncogene MYCN is amplified in 25% of high-risk neuroblastoma and is associated with an aggressive tumour phenotype, enhanced tumour angiogenesis and poor clinical prognosis. The Mycn oncoprotein is highly expressed in tumour but not in normal tissues, making it an attractive candidate for targeted therapeutics. To assess the relevance of MYCN overexpression in neuroblastoma, and to test Mycn-targeted therapeutics, a murine transgenic model that faithfully replicates the disease biology of high-risk neuroblastoma by targeting overexpression of MYCN to the neural crest was constructed. As a prelude to the assessment of novel therapeutics for the treatment of neuroblastoma, and given the retroperitoneal localisation of these tumours, the TH-MYCN model has been characterised in vivo by non-invasive MRI. Mice with abdominal tumours identified by palpation were imaged on a 7T Bruker MicroImaging system (n=7). Anatomical T2-weighted coronal images revealed that all TH-MYCN mice developed large peri-renal retroperitoneal tumours, likely originating from the adrenal glands, that displaced major abdominal organs (kidney, liver, stomach). Major vessels were characteristically distorted, with enlargement of the abdominal aorta and vena cava. Forty-eight hours after treatment with cyclophosphamide (100mg/kg x 2 doses, over 48 hours), tumours were difficult to identify or were undetectable, consistent with previous studies showing remission in TH-MYCN and with the clinical sensitivity of childhood neuroblastoma to CP. Further screening of these mice by MRI is ongoing to interrogate tumour relapse. Additionally, quantitation of tumour MRI relaxation rates revealed a very heterogeneous spatial distribution of T1 (1748 +/- 14ms), T2 (55 +/- 1ms) and R2* (115 +/- 3s-1). The relatively fast baseline R2* is indicative of a large tumour blood volume, confirmed by the intense red coloration of these tumours at excision, and the presence of a large proportion of blood lakes observed histologically. The high degree of tumour perfusion was corroborated by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI following intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA, and which revealed parenchymal enhancement typically across the whole tumour (IAUGC60 = 0.13 +/- 0.01ms). This study reinforces the TH-MYCN murine model as a faithful representation of human neuroblastoma in its anatomical and radiological appearance, and in its high sensitivity to CP. It also demonstrates that the implementation of MRI screening is an asset in the development of novel therapeutics for neuroblastoma and could accelerate their clinical development by allowing simultaneous evaluation of MRI biomarkers of treatment response.

N2  - Introduction: Progress in ultrasound techniques enables its use for diagnostics of peripheral nerve diseases. Sonography is useful for neuro-imaging to get additional information about peripheral nerves, especially if electrophysiology approaches are limited. In a special case of a severe neuropathy ultrasound provided important data and allowed short-term re-examination. Case-report: We present a 27-year-old female patient with a progressive sensorimotor neuropathy of the legs since her early childhood. Physical examination revealed a severe peroneal atrophy with high-grade paresis of extension and flexion of feet and a hypesthesia of the lower legs. Family anamnesis, genetic examination of CMT disease and laboratory results were normal. In the electrophysiologic testings nerve conduction velocities of the legs were not detectable. Neurography and sonography of the arms were normal. High-resolution ultrasound of the tibial nerves on both sides showed a hypertrophy with cross sectional areas about twice as large compared with the normal population. Based on these results, a selective high-resoulution MRI of the affected region was possible. It also showed a hypertrophy of the tibital nerves with contrast agent enhancement on both sides. Sural nerve biopsy showed an intraneural perineurioma on the right side and a severe axonal damage without indicating an inflammatory etiology on the left side. Discussion(s): High-resolution ultrasound of peripheral nerves enriches the diagnostic methods in peripheral nerve diseases. In the present case there was no response after electric stimulation of all nerves in the lower limbs which makes them unsuitable for further diagnostic information and re-examination. High-resolution sonography represents an alternative method which is rapidly available. The etiology of the polyneuropathy described above is presently unknown. It might be a rare manifestation of a hereditary neuropathy, whereas normal result of neurography and ultrasound of the upper limbs are uncommon. Usually the nerves of the arms are affected although they were clinically normal. The detection of an intraneural perineurioma in the right sural nerve might be an accidental coincidence, but the combination with homogenous cross sectional area enlargement of both tibial nerves might imply a multifocal and segmental intraneural peroneurioma as a reason of the polyneuropathy. A bilateral occurrence of this benign nerve tumor was described by Beekmann et al. (2004) located at the ulnar nerve. High-resolution sonography will be the method of choice to monitor the course of this peripheral nerve disease.

T1  - Spinal cord injury pain - From symptom to pathology

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Chronic pain following spinal cord injury is very common and affects approximately 70-80% of the patients. About 35-40% suffers from neuropathic pain. To distinguish neuropathic from nociceptive pain states, the IASP has introduced a mechanism-oriented classification of chronic pains in spinal cord injury (Siddall et al., 2002). Pain below the level of injury, so called below-level pain, is of central origin as a direct consequence of spinal cord damage. Pain at the level of injury, so-called at-level pain, may be a driven by damage of the spinal cord, of the nerve roots or by a combination of both. Central below-level pain seems to be the most serious types of pain and its treatment is often insufficient. Clinically, central pain typically develops with a delay after the initial trauma. The pain is typically localized in an area of abnormal sensitivity corresponding to the preceding central lesion. Being types of neuropathic pain, ongoing pain as well as evoked pains are frequently found in below-level pain as well as in at-level pain. Pathophysiologically, recent studies indicate that factors which have been already suggested to be involved in peripheral neuropathic pain, such as alterations in expression of sodium channels and inflammatory processes, may play a key role in the development of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury. It has been demonstrated that a combination of lesioned and residual spinothalamic pathways seems to predict development of central pain (Wasner et al., 2008). Anatomical changes within pain-related regions as well as within regions of the classic reward circuitry, have been identified by recent diffusion tensor imaging studies indicating additional pain-related structural changes at supraspinal level (Gustin et al., 2009). Pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury is still a great challenge, but evidence points efficacy of pregabalin (grade A), gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, lamotrigine and opioids (grade B). Whether interesting new treatment strategies involving imagination of movement have an analgesic effect needs to be evaluated (Moseley, 2007).

N2  - 23 years male T1DM for 18 years, necrobiosis lipoidica, peripheral neuropathy and multiple admissions with diabetes ketoacidosis presenting complaints H/O leg pains and weakness of the right leg prompting to use of a walking stick. An MRI of the right hip and examination under anaesthesia was conducted which did not reveal any abnormality. Then he presented with low GCS following overdose with cocodamol and alcohol, managed in ITU. He developed urinary retention and loss of temperature, pain and vibration sense along with motor weakness below T6 spinal level. An MRI scan showed the spinal cord changes consistent with acute myelopathy. With the history of sensory neuropathy and gradually progressive motor weakness in the right leg, myelopathy is secondary to diabetes. No other pathological process was identified. Microangiopathy of vasanervorum and effects of advanced glycation end products may explain the pathogenesis in this case. A group in Israel has reported 12 cases of spinal cord involvement secondary to diabetes by retrospective analysis of the data. Recently a diabetes research unit from Sheffield demonstrated significant difference in the spinal cross-sectional area between patient with diabetes and without DSP (diabetic sensory peripheral neuropathy) and in healthy subjects. There was smaller cord area in patient with diabetes with DSP compared to controls. Summary: Myelopathy in diabetes is not common but is the most likely in our case, and has previously been reported. Though the evidence surrounding this is not sufficient, we propose more data has to be created. We propose that in cases of atypical neuropathic symptoms imaging of the spinal cord may demonstrate abnormality.

N2  - We describe radiological findings and measurements of the cross-sectional area of the sciatic nerve in a group of 10 patients with genetically-confirmed Charcot-Marie- Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), 9 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and 10 healthy controls using magnetic resonance imaging. The mid-thigh of each individual was imaged using a shorttau- inversion recovery sequence and the nerve appearance radiologically evaluated with respect to the signal intensity and visibility of internal structure. The cross-sectional area of the sciatic nerve of each individual was measured by defining irregular enclosing regions of interest. The sciatic nerve area was enlarged in both pathologies compared to controls (p < 0.01) with the greatest increases in CMT1A. Median (inter-quartile range) areas were 67.6 (16.2) mm2 for the CIDP group, 135.9 (60.9) mm2 for the CMT1A group and 43.3 (26.6) mm2 for the control group. Median nerve areas of both patient groups were significantly larger than the controls (p < 0.01). Logistic regression revealed that sciatic nerve area could be used to discriminate between patients and controls (p < 0.04). Measurement of sciatic nerve hypertrophy on MRI may be of assistance in cases where the diagnosis is still in doubt, complementing other clinical investigations and potentially providing a tool to measure response to therapies.

N2  - Background: In traumatic injuries of the brachial plexus the preoperative assessment of nerve root avulsions is essential for surgical planning. In the diagnostic workup MR mielography has almost completely replaced CT myelography as the first choice examination. To our knowledge there are no reports on the application of Diffusion Tensor Imaging to the study of traumatic brachial plexus palsies. Purpose(s): Evaluation of the clinical feasibility of diffusion tensor tractography of the brachial plexus in a selected population of patients with traumatic brachial plexus injuries. Material(s) and Method(s):. Ten patiens (8 males, 2 females, mean age 27.4, range 16-52) with traumatic brachial plexus palsies (6 left, 4 right) have been examined with 1.5 T scanner (Siemens, Avanto) with the following imaging protocol: a) 3D MR mielography (3DMRM) with multiplanar reconstructions along the course of cervical nerve roots (3D T2 Fast Spin Echo sequences, 0.7 mm isotropic voxel), b) 3D T2 STIR SPACE sequences (TR 2000, TE 149, TI 160, 1 mm isotropic voxel), C) DTI (64 contiguous axial sections from C3 to T2, TR 9200 TE 90, 12 directions, 2.2 mm isotropic voxel, 5 runs, peripheral triggering, FOV 250 mm). DTI data were preprocessed coregistering every single direction of each run with the first bO and corrected for eddy currents with FSL (FMRIB Software Library; Oxford, UK) FDT tool. Tractography of the brachial plexus and cervical spinal cord was obtained placing multiple 3D ROIs along the extraforaminal course of C5-T1 nerve roots on MPR reformatted bO coronal images. Nerve root avulsions were defined on MR tractography on the basis of a loss of continuity with the spinal cord fibres. Brachial plexus tractography diagnostic accuracy was assessed comparing it with 3DMRM findings on a per root basis on 100 nerve roots. Result(s): 3DMRM detected 18 avulsed nerve roots and 32 intact roots on the injured side. Brachial plexus tractography had 94% sensitivity, 87% specificity, 60% PPV and 98% NPV compared to 3DMRM, with 1 false negative and 12 false positives. The relatively elevated false positive rate is mainly related to the evaluation of C8-T1 nerve roots, which are displayed in a suboptimal way, due to their anatomical course adjacent to bone. Conclusion(s): Diffusion tensor tractography is a cutting-edge technique for studying peripheral nerves, which cannot be as readily and reliably performed in the spinal cord and brachial plexus for technical and anatomical reasons such as pulsation artefacts, motion of organs in the thorax and large number of longitudinal fibres. Compared to 3DMRM brachial plexus tractography is characterized by an elevated diagnostic accuracy in the assessment of nerve root avulsions, which can be easily displayed as loss of continuity with spinal cord fibres. Although DTI of the brachial plexus is still an experimental technique which needs further testing in order to produce meaningful clinical results, our preliminary experience suggests its promising role in the assessment of nerve continuity in traumatic injuries of the brachial plexus.

N2  - Background: Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), is a rare neurodegenerative disorder, involving axons on both the central and the peripheral nervous system with presence of axonal swelling and spheroids bodies (SB) as pathological hallmark. The disorder is characterized by infantile onset with arrest and rapid regression of motor and cognitive developmental milestones, hypotonia evolving in spastic tetraplegia, and visual impairment. Eighty percent of patients with INAD had mutations in PLA2G6 gene. In addition, more recently, two different syndromes with allelic disorders of the same gene, causing atypical neuroaxonal dystrophies with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), are been identified; the Karak and the Kurian syndrome, overlapping clinically with neurodegeneration caused by PANK2 gene mutations (Halleworden-Spatz). The thirteen Kurian's patients showed homogeneous clinical phenotype, cerebellar atrophy and gliosis, w.m. abnormalities, and atrophy of corpus callosum. Ten children had increased iron deposit in the globus pallidus (GP), seven had axonal neuropathy with SB. Previous studies found that SB. were not expected to bee seen in all tissue specimens of INAD patients. The negative result may be due to early biopsy after disease onset. In the early stage of the disease, the diagnosis of INAD may be difficult, based on clinical and neurophysiological findings only. Traditionally, the definitive diagnosis of INAD required the demonstration of axonal SB by biopsy. The evidence that large proportions of INAD have a mutation in the PLA2G6 gene, allows molecular diagnosis and often negates the need for more invasive procedures, such as biopsy. The recent advances in molecular diagnosis have increased the genotype-phenotype correlation. The most frequent MRI sign of INAD, is a diffuse and progressive cerebellar atrophy that at a very early age it is mainly involving the inferior part of the vermis. The high T2 signal of the cerebellar cortex, likely resulting from gliosis, was initially considered a "pathognomonic" sign of the disease but it is not always present and it may appear only in an later phase of the disease. Purpose(s): Our purpose was to review the clinical reports, the longitudinal MRI studies, and the available neuropathological features of a group of patients with clinical and radiological INAD phenotype in order to identify the earliest and most important MRI signs of the disease and their evolution, and to correlate the clinical/radiological phenotype with the genetic mutations when results of molecular study were available. Material(s) and Method(s): Detailed reviews of the clinical and MRI features of nine patients (four boys and five girls) with clinical and MRI onset and evolution strongly supporting INAD diagnosis, were analyzed in order to identify the earliest and most important features suggesting diagnosis. All the patients had the clinical onset within the first two years of life. The mean age at the onset was ten months. We evaluate the MRI findings in the first study as well as in the follow up and correlate these findings with the clinical features present at the time of the exam and with the patient's age. The MRI signs investigated were: presence, extension and topography of cerebellar atrophy, "cerebellar gliosis", T2 signal of the GP and substantia nigra/subthalamic nuclei, cerebral white matter abnormalities, cerebral atrophy, corpus callosum changes and optic pathway atrophy. In addition, five patients had Proton MR Spectroscopy (H+MRS), diffusion MRI (DWI), and diffusion tensor (DTI) analysis. Results and Conclusion(s): Progressive cerebellar atrophy was the only MRI finding reported in all patients. The high signal cerebellar cortex was not a constant finding, it was also noted in two cases, without a definitive genetic or pathologic evidence of INAD. We did not observe decreased T2 signal in the GP or substantia nigra, reported in NBIA due to PANK2 gene mutations or to rare atypical NBIA with mutation in the PLA2G6. The value of other cerebral and optic nerve MRI abnormalities and the role of advanced MR techniques, as H+ MRS, DWI and DTI, was evaluate. Three children presented the clinical onset after a respiratory illness, a presentation which mimics many inborn errors of the metabolism. Most of the children in our group were investigated for such possibilities, resulting negative. The recognition of MRI and clinical features consisting with INAD, reduces the need for extensive metabolic testing and steers the molecular analysis, avoiding biopsy to confirm diagnosis. On the other hand, some patients with typical clinical and pathological features of INAD are negative for PLA2G6 mutations; therefore, the absence of either PLA2G6 mutations or pathological evidence may not exclude the diagnosis of INAD strongly suggested by clinical and MRI diagnostic criteria and it allows the possibility of genetic heterogeneity for INAD phenotype.

N2  - Objective: Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is an X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) with onset in adulthood that presents with peripheral neuropathy and myelopathy. Despite primary involvement of specific spinal cord white matter tracts, recent evidence using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) supports cerebral pathology in the corticospinal tract (CST) in patients with AMN. A newer image analysis tool, large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM), allows for more rapid analysis of whole brain white matter. To enhance further exploration of cerebral pathology in AMN, we validated LDDMM results against DTIStudio analysis of the CST in a cohort of patients with AMN. Method(s): 5 mild and 5 severely affected AMN patients were studied; clinical severity was measured by the expanded disability status scale. Patients were scanned on Philips 1.5T MRI system, acquiring whole-brain DTI images. CST white matter integrity was analyzed using both DTIStudio and LDDMM. Result(s): In patients with AMN, the DTI-derived metrics (fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and perpendicular diffusivity (lambda)) have been shown to differ significantly from control values (p<0.01) in the CST from the pons to thalamus, thus indicating a change in white matter integrity. The values for this section of CST are: FA = 0.54+/-0.05, MD = 0.88+/-0.02, l = 0.58+/-0.04, which will be compared to the LDDMM results. Conclusion(s): Application of the LDDMM method to brain imaging in patients with AMN will further enhance the understanding of cerebral pathology by allowing for rapid, complete analysis of brain white matter tracts.

N2  - Central nervous system involvement in diabetic sensorimotor neuropathy (DN) is being increasingly recognised. We have previously demonstrated the presence of spinal cord atrophy not only in subjects with established-DN but also in early, subclinical DSP. In a further proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H+MRS) study, subjects with established-DN were found to exhibit thalamic neuronal dysfunction. In this study we looked at the relationship between spinal cord atrophy and thalamic neuronal function in DSP. Method(s): Twenty subjects [6 healthy volunteers; 14 diabetic subjects (8 No-DN and 6 Established-DN)] underwent detailed assessment of peripheral nerve function including: neuropathic symptom evaluation, clinical examination to determine the Neuropathy Impairment Score of Lower Limbs (NIS[LL]), 5 attributes of nerve electrophysiology, vibration detection threshold and heart rate with deep breathing test. MR imaging of the cervical spine and thalamic H-MRS were conducted within one year. Cervical cord cross-sectional area at disc level C2/C3 was calculated. Established markers of neuronal function [N-acetyl aspartate:choline (NA:Cho)] were obtained from the thalamus using long echo time H+MRS. Result(s): There was no significant difference in subgroup demographics [age: HV 42.5(15.4), No-DN 42.8(8.7), and Established-DN 48.4 (11.3)]. NIS[LL]+7 test score was significantly higher in subjects with Established- DN [21.8(15.2)] compared with No-DN [1.14(1.07); p<0.05]. Subjects with Established-DN had significant reduction in both cervical cord area [ANOVA p=0.002; Established-DN mean(SD) 52.1(4.1) vs No-DSP 68.8(8.20), p=0.001 and Established-DN vs HV 68.7(10.4), p=0.002] and thalamic NA: Cho [ANOVA p=0.013; Established-DN 1.58(0.16) vs No-DN 1.80(0.15) and Established-DN vs HV 1.74(1.0)] compared to the other groups. Among subjects with diabetes, cervicalcord area was significantly related to thalamic NA: Cho (r=0.42, p=0.04). Conclusion(s): Diabetic subjects with Established-DN had the greatest level of spinal cord atrophy and thalamic neuronal dysfunction compared those with No-DN and HV. Significant positive correlations between spinal cord area and thalamic NA:Cho suggest progressive, concomitant involvement of the central nervous system in DN. The pathophysiological insult on the nervous system caused by DN appears more generalised, involving both the peripheral and central nervous systems.

N2  - Introduction: The successful accomplishment of regional anaesthesia (RA) requires profound theoretical knowledge and repeated performance of RA to gain sufficient manual skills. Despite the increasing use of simulators to learn and improve medical skills, the adoption of mannequins for RA training is limited by patient variance, inaccurate representation of biological tissue, and physical wear from repeated use. However, interactive virtual reality (VR) simulators are potentially valuable to overcome these constraints. In an interdisciplinary approach, we therefore launched the Regional Anaesthesia Simulation (RASim, http://www.rasim.info/) project. Method(s): Individual subject-specific data is obtained noninvasively without contrast agent from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) representing morphology and vascular structures, respectively. For data handling, registration, and segmentation, an application is developed on the basis of the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK), the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK), and the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). Additional segmentation algorithms are integrated, and a hierarchical tree data structure is created to simulate the flexible anatomical structures of peripheral nerve cords. The simulator is implemented in theVRtoolkit ViSTA. Several modules for collision detection, virtual humanoids, interaction, and visualization are applied. To simulate needle interaction and electric impulse transmission, a novel approach based on electric distances is developed. A pilot study among ten residents, who had to perform a femoral nerve block, is carried out with the simulator (Figure 1a) and systematically evaluated using a 24-item questionnaire on a 5 point Likert-scale ranking between 1 (best) and 5 (worse). Furthermore, our individualized image data is compared with a current state-of-the-art commercial dataset (Zygote, USA), that consists of geometry and textures representing the anatomy of a male subject (Figure 1b). The PHANTOM Omni Haptic Device (SensAble Technologies, USA) is used for realistic control of the instruments and to provide the optional force feedback. Results are expressed as mean+/-SD. Result(s): MRI and MRA data were obtained from 5 individuals from the inguinal region. Relevant data were successfully extracted employing our new software. Further differentiation of anatomical structures was realised using an ontology subdividing and describing tissue types as well as cavities. As nerves cannot be sufficiently visualized, virtual nerve cords were modelled according to a hierarchical data structure along anatomical landmarks. The simulator utilized this data and consistently applied the developed (Figure Presented) modules for collision detection, virtual humanoids, interaction, and visualization. Needle interaction and electric impulse transmission was simulated realistically. The user study showed an overall acceptance (1.8+/-1.6) with the ease of use of the simulator. Also the anatomy and identification of landmarks were highly rated (2.2+/-1.6), both for our and the Zygote datasets. Further, we did not reveal any advantage of the commercial dataset. Despite the use of a 3D navigation, 90% of the participants stressed the importance of the incorporation of sophisticated haptic feedback allowing the tactile perception of tissue resistance. Discussion(s): In order to create a VR-based simulator, we successfully introduced a highly flexible software structure using sophisticated algorithms and multimodal representations of anatomy. This approach allows creating individualised VR patients for training a variety of RA blocks to enhance realism and user acceptance. The success of this concept was also confirmed by our pilot study, which further showed, that the quality of our imaging approach is comparable to commercial available data sets. Prospective research will include the extension of other anatomical regions and the integration of ultrasound to perform peripheral nerve blocks.

N2  - Biallelic mutations in the gene encoding HCLS-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) cause autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Some of these patients have neurological abnormalities including developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and/or epilepsy. Recent genotype-phenotype studies have shown that mutations in HAX1 affecting transcripts A (NM_006118.3) and B (NM_001018837.1) cause the phenotype of SCN with neurological impairment, while mutations affecting isoform A but not B lead to SCN without neurological aberrations. In this study, we identified a consanguineous family with two patients suffering from SCN and neurological disease caused by a novel, homozygous genomic deletion including exons 4-7 of the HAX1 gene. Quantitative MRI analyses showed generalized alterations in cerebral proton density in both of the patients, as well as in an additional unrelated patient with another HAX1 mutation (Arg86X) known to be associated with neurological manifestations. This study provides first in vivo evidence of aberrant neuroimaging findings associated with HAX1 deficiency in SCN patients. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T1  - Non-invasive imaging of nerve regeneration
A1  - Sheikh, Kazim A. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - The need for non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerves that can reliably assess extent of nerve fiber degeneration and regeneration is increasingly realized. Availability of such a technology has several immediate clinical and preclinical applications. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an emerging magnetic resonance based technology that is particularly suited for imaging nerve fiber tracts. This review highlights immediate clinical and preclinical uses of non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerve regeneration and DTI as a potential technology that can fulfill these clinical and research needs. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to determine the intrasubject side-to-side variability of quantitative and qualitative measures of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography of the median nerves and to determine the precision of quantitative measurements and fiber tractography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifteen healthy volunteers (seven men, eight women; mean age, 31.2 years) underwent DTI of both wrists with a single-shot spin-echo-based echoplanar imaging sequence (TR/TE, 7,000/103; b value 1,025 s/mm2). Postprocessing included fiber tractography and quantitative analysis of fiber length, fiber density index, fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, and signal-to-noise ratio. Two readers in consensus graded the quality of fiber tract images of the two wrists as equal, slightly different, or very different. Fiber tractography and all analyses were repeated after 3 weeks, and the images from the two sessions were compared. RESULTS. No statistically significant side-to-side differences in quantitative data were found (p = 0.054-0.999). In all subjects, the quality of fiber tract images of the right and left median nerves was either slightly or very different. Between the initial and the second quantitative analyses, no statistically significant differences (p = 0.086-0.898) were found, and the quality of fiber tract images was rated equal for nine of 15 subjects (60%) and slightly different for six of 15 subjects (40%). CONCLUSION. Preliminary results indicate that quantitative evaluation of DTI of the median nerve is precise. The absence of statistically significant intrasubject side-to-side variability in quantitative data suggests that the healthy contralateral nerve can be used as an internal control. Observed side-to-side variability in the quality of fiber tract images, however, rules out side-to-side comparisons in fiber tractography. © American Roentgen Ray Society.

N2  - Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) typically affects young, healthy children who develop rapid-onset severe encephalopathy triggered by viral infections. This disease is more commonly reported in Japan but occurs worldwide, although it remains under-recognized in Western countries. An autosomal dominant form, ANE1, was recently identified. We report the details of a 9-year-old Caucasian female who experienced recurrent ANE episodes at the ages of 9 months and 9 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were characteristic of ANE during both episodes, although more extensive in the recent episode, which resulted in severe neurological sequelae; influenza A was identified on bronchoalveolar lavage during this episode. Interestingly, there was evidence of peripheral polyneuropathy during the recent episode, which has not previously been described in sporadic ANE. Both the patient and her mother, who had also had postviral polyneuritis in the past, harbour a mutation in Ran-binding protein 2 (RANBP2); this occurred de novo in the mother and confers genetic susceptibility to ANE. Our case suggests that recurrent disease and/or an expanded clinical phenotype raises the possibility of ANE1; positive family history, although supportive, is not necessary as the mutation can occur de novo. Increased awareness may lead to earlier recognition and better treatment options. © The Authors. Journal compilation © Mac Keith Press 2009.

N2  - Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows the directional dependence of water diffusion to be studied. Analysis of the resulting image data allows for the determination of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), as well as allowing three-dimensional visualization of the fiber tract (tractography). We visualized the ulnar nerve of ten healthy volunteers with DTI. We found FA to be 0.752 +/-0.067 and the ADC to be 0.96 +/- 0.13x10-3 mm2/s. A nuts-and-bolts description of the physical aspects of DTI is provided as an educational process for readers. © 2010 ISS.

N2  - The assessment of human peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles by means of diffusion tensor imaging and tractograpy has been a recent area of research. These techniques have been successfully applied in both volunteers and patients, providing non-invasively, quantitative microstructural parameters (mainly mean fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient) and offering a three-dimensional visualization tool of nerves and muscles fibers. DTI and tractography may reveal abnormalities that are beyond the resolution of conventional MR techniques and hence open the way to potential clinical applications. In this article, we will first summarize the current state of DTI and tractography in the evaluation of peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles as well as their potential future clinical applications. Then, we will address important technical considerations, which understanding is necessary to appropriately apply DTI and tractograhy, and in order to understand the current limitations of these innovative and promising techniques. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and potential clinical applications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography in the normal and pathologic brachial plexus prospectively. Method(s): Six asymptomatic volunteers and 12 patients with symptoms related to the brachial plexus underwent DTI on a 1.5T system in addition to the routine anatomic plexus imaging protocol. Maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and of fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as tractography of the brachial plexus were obtained. Images were evaluated by two experienced neuroradiologists in a prospective fashion. Three patients underwent surgery, and nine patients underwent conservative medical treatment. Result(s): Reconstructed DTI (17/18) were of good quality (one case could not be reconstructed due to artifacts). In all volunteers and in 11 patients, the roots and the trunks were clearly delineated with tractography. Mean FA and mean ADC values were as follows: 0.30+/-0.079 and 1.70+/-0.35 mm2/s in normal fibers, 0.22+/-0.04 and 1.49+/-0.49 mm2/s in benign neurogenic tumors, and 0.24+/-0.08 and 1.51+/-0.52 mm 2/s in malignant tumors, respectively. Although there was no statistically significant difference in FA and ADC values of normal fibers and fibers at the level of pathology, tractography revealed major differences regarding fiber architecture. In benign neurogenic tumors (n=4), tractography revealed fiber displacement alone (n=2) or fiber displacement and encasement by the tumor (n=2), whereas in the malignant tumors, either fiber disruption/destruction with complete disorganization (n=6) or fiber displacement (n=1) were seen. In patients with fiber displacement alone, surgery confirmed the tractography findings, and excision was successful without sequelae. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data suggest that DTI with tractography is feasible in a clinical routine setting. DTI may demonstrate normal tracts, tract displacement, deformation, infiltration, disruption, and disorganization of fibers due to tumors located within or along the brachial plexus, therefore, yielding additional information to the current standard anatomic imaging protocols. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Development of outcome measures to assess ongoing nerve regeneration in the living animal that can be translated to human can provide extremely useful tools for monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions to promote nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance based technique, provides image contrast for nerve tracts and can be applied serially on the same subject with potential to monitor nerve fiber content. In this study, we examined the use of ex vivo high-resolution DTI for imaging intact and regenerating peripheral nerves in mice and correlated the MRI findings with electrophysiology and histology. DTI was done on sciatic nerves with crush, without crush, and after complete transection in different mouse strains. DTI measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA), parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity were acquired and compared in segments of uninjured and crushed/transected nerves and correlated with morphometry. A comparison of axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush showed a comparable pattern of regeneration in different mice strains. FA values were significantly lower in completely denervated nerve segments compared to uninjured sciatic nerve and this signal was restored toward normal in regenerating nerve segments (crushed nerves). Histology data indicate that the FA values and the parallel diffusivity showed a positive correlation with the total number of regenerating axons. These studies suggest that DTI is a sensitive measure of axon regeneration in mouse models and provide basis for further development of imaging technology for application to living animals and humans. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Results: The pathophysiology associated with diabetic neuropathy (DN) appears to be complex and is not fully understood. As well as peripheral nerve abnormalities, recent imaging studies have indicated spinal cord and brain involvement. The form and extent of changes to the spinalcorticosomatosensory pathways may well be important when determining disease mechanisms. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance (MR) technique that can measure the anisotropy of parenchymal water diffusion, reflecting cellular architecture, in-vivo. Information from DTI can yield models which reflect the make-up of axonal pathways (tractography) within the CNS. This preliminary study sought to provide an initial assessment of spinal-corticosomatosensory pathway involvement in DN monitored by MR diffusion tractography. High field (3T) diffusion MR Imaging has been performed on 6 non-diabetic healthy volunteers and 4 subjects with painless DN (Dyck's staging criteria). High angular-resolution DTI (32 directions) datasets have been acquired (1.75x1.75x2mm2 resolution) covering the entire cerebrum and cerebellum. Following data acquisition, diffusion tensor matrices were calculated from which tractography was performed [MedINRIA, www-sop.inria.fr]. Two regions of interest defined on the underlying anatomical images comprised: (i) right somatosensory cortex and (ii) brainstem. The mean number (+/-sd) of calculated tracts passing through both of these regions were: 193+/-1 in healthy volunteers and 170+/-28 in the DN group. As expected, all identified tracts passed through the thalamus. Minor cortical and cerebellar contralateral connectivity was apparent. These data indicate a trend suggesting abnormalities in intracranial parenchymal water diffusivity, consistent with representing a lower number of axonal fibre tracts. If proven significant, this implies that the involvement of the CNS is not limited to a length dependent axonal degeneration of first order but also involves second order neurons. Additional data is required to determine the significance of these preliminary findings. This information further underlines the need to map out CNS involvement in diabetic neuropathy.

N2  - Aim of the study: Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC) responsible of the regular relationship between myelin breakdown and production, causing a severe demyelination of both the central and peripheral nervous system. The most frequent type of Krabbe disease has an infantile onset. Unusual slowly progressive adult forms have also been described. We described early involvement of the upper corticospinal tract in a case of a patient affected by late-onset form of disease. Material(s) and Method(s): A 25-year-old man was hospitalized with a 12 months history of progressive lower limbs wasting and weakness, gait unsteadiness with difficulty walking on uneven surfaces. Neurological examination showed mild weakness and wasting of all muscles of the upper and lower limbs with bilateral postural tremor. Tendon reflexes were normal at upper limbs and symmetrically increased at lower limbs with absent Babinski sign. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with high field scanner (3T). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed at the level of the centrum semiovale with a point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) technique with long and short TE. Metabolites were analyzed in the areas of MR signal abnormalities and normalappearing brain. Thirtytwo-direction DTI and quantitative tractography of the corticospinal tracts were performed. Result(s): MRI revealed symmetrical selective increased signal intensity both on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, along the corticospinal tracts, extending from cortical-subcortical junction to the cerebral peduncles. The abnormal signal intensity was detectable also across the corpus callosum at the isthmus, which was thinner. MRS snowed a very mild elevation of Choline (Cho) and an abnormal peak at 3.6 ppm. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and creatine peaks were normal both in gray and white matter. DTI with quantitative tractography detected significant loss of diffusion anisotropy in the corticospinal tracts. On biochemical investigaton homocysteine level was 56.7 micromoles liter (normal level < 13 umol/i). A low b-galatocerebrosidase level was detected in the serum and confirmed with lysosomal analysis of fibroblasts from a skin biopsy that showed a galactosylceramide b galactocerebrosidase level of 0.00 U/g (normal range 0.03-0.12). Conclusion(s): These results confirm the vulnerability of corticospinal tracts is the earliest neuroradiological marker of Krabbe disease in adult patients. Diffusion tensor-derived anisotropy maps provide a quantitative measure of abnormal white matter in patients with Krabbe disease and are more sensitive than T2-weighted images for detecting white matter abnormality.

N2  - DTI is a magnetic resonance based technology that is particularly suited for imaging nerve fiber tracts. Because of limitations of current clinical and investigative measures to assess peripheral nerve injury and repair in some clinical situations, the need for non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerves that can reliably assess extent of nerve degeneration and regeneration is increasingly realized.Availability of such a technology can be immediately applicable to patients with traumatic nerve injuries to assess nerve injury and repair and in the area of therapeutics aiming to enhance nerve regeneration/ repair. With this in mind, we have developed acquisition and image analysis protocols to obtain quantitative measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA), parallel and perpendicular diffusivities, and FA-based 3D-reconstructions of the individual nerves. Eight normal controls underwent scanning of their lower legs or forearms with the goal to develop norms for different DTI parameters for further application to patients to differentiate the healthy and diseased nerves and monitor nerve regeneration/repair. Our results show the viability of this approach to image various nerves of different sizes in both upper and lower extremities. These ongoing studies support that this imaging modality has the potential to assess nerve injury and repair.

N2  - Over one million people in the United Kingdom have diabetes mellitus, of whom around 7-10% will, at some point, develop a foot ulcer. This becomes even more significant with the increasing age of the population as the prevalence of diabetes increases. Diabetic patients are particularly prone to peripheral neuropathy and peripheral atherosclerotic disease, which results in some patients getting foot ulceration and gangrene. Foot ulceration and gangrene are important causes of morbidity in diabetic patients and therefore it is important that measures are taken that would eventually lead to healing of the ulcers or gangrene. As occlusive atherosclerotic disease of the tibial arteries is particularly common in diabetic patients, and infra popliteal revascularisation is often required. This has traditionally been accomplished by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or a surgical bypass, with moderately good results. More recently, subintimal angioplasty has been practiced as an alternative minimally invasive treatment to recanalise long arterial occlusions with promising patentcy rates even in small vessels of the lower leg. Treatment of diabetic vascular disease is challenging and requires an aggressive multi disciplinary approach with co-operation between diabetologists, interventional radiologists, vascular and plastic surgeons. Non invasive vascular imaging is normally the first line investigation in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Whilst in non diabetic patients, the ABPI (ankle brachial pressure index) is reduced in the presence of peripheral vascular disease, and in diabetic patients it can be falsely high due to calcified and non compliant peripheral vasculature, and is therefore unreliable. Duplex scanning is a fast, cost effective and non invasive way of imaging diseased arteries in the periphery but it is operator dependant. The tibial arteries can sometimes be difficult to image, especially in the presence of calcification, oedema, ulceration and bandaging of the legs. Despite these limitations, it proves an extremely useful investigation and usually sufficient to base a decision, on the mode of intervention for revascularisation, either by surgery or angioplasty. MRI has boosted the non invasive imaging potential of patients with peripheral vascular disease. Excellent pictures can be produced in the majority of patients with proximal arteries particularly well demonstrated. Accurate demonstration of tibial vessels requires a cooperative patient and a radiologist geared up to providing a good study. Patients who are incapable of keeping still and who are suffering from claustrophobia may be unsuitable. CT angiography has an application and as multi slice and fast scanners are becoming more available, it is assuming greater importance, particularly in the tibial arteries. Femoral angiography and, in particular, DSA (digital subtraction angiography) has been regarded as the gold standard for demonstrating the arterial tree up to the foot vessels. This would usually precede an invasive intervention for treating tibial arteries. The aim of endovascular treatment of tibial arteries is to at least achieve a straight line flow down to one of the foot vessels. Patients with critical limb ischemia, in particular diabetic patients, tend to have distal vessel disease, which may be affecting all the run off vessels. Long occlusions are a common occurrence. After antegrade femoral puncture, DSA will reveal the extent of disease in the below knee arteries. Whilst the conventional PTA is available to treat simple stenosis or short occlusions in the tibial vessels, subintimal angioplasty is capable of treating a large number of cases because of the ability of the technique to treat long tibial occlusions, multiple vessels and reconstitution of the trifurcation. Subintimal angioplasty has been shown to make a substantial impact on the treatment of critical limb ischaemia mainly due to the fact that long superficial femoral artery and tibial occlusions can be tackled with this technique, quite often at the same sitting. The technique involves traversing the occlusion through the subintimal space, this making use of the disease free dissection space that becomes available as a conduit for blood flow. The technique utilises a deliberate but controlled arterial dissection to cross an arterial occlusion. The subintimal space is the path of least resistance, therefore, relatively easy to cross using a loop in a hydrophilic guide wire. The wire most commonly used has a 1.5 mm J tip (Terumo Japan), which helps to form a loop in these small vessels. The wire is "half stiff" and is 0.035 diameter and 180 cm long. The leading edge of the J wire, in the form of the loop, is followed by a 5 French 3 x 20 mm balloon catheter. The reason for using the short length of the balloon is to overcome the level of resistance encountered during crossing of long occlusions. It is important to keep the length of the loop short in order to avoid the possibility of a perforation. This is achieved by progressive advancement of the loop, followed by the balloon catheter and then withdrawal of part of the wire in order to reduce the length of the loop. As one approaches the level of the end of the occlusion, the loop must be significantly short (1-2 cm in length) and with some twisting action re-entry is usually achieved without a great deal of effort. Having crossed the lesion, the entire length of the occlusion is dilated using the same balloon catheter. The inflations are short (5 seconds) in order to achieve recanalisation in the shortest periods of time. Subintimal angioplasty allows the recanalisation of the trifurcation. Therefore, if more than one vessels is available distally, the aim is to try and achieve recanalisation into whatever vessels are available. This has the advantage of not only increasing the total perfusion of the foot, but helping with the patency of any proximally angioplastied segments, as the overall flow will be faster through multiple recanalised vessels. Subintimal angioplasty in infrapopliteal artery occlusions was first reported in 1994. There have been a number of publications since, all of them reporting excellent outcomes in terms of limb salvage. Primary success rates of 80-90% are achieved depending on experience and limb salvage rates of around 88% have been reported consistently.

N2  - Objective: CIDP is acquired neuropathy with progressions and relapses. Multiple sclerosis (MS) evolve with relapsing remitting, progressive course. Cases: Case 1: A female aged 18 developed facial weakness, limb paresthesias, imbalance. On 1st admission, brain MRI was normal. Ten years later she experienced dysarthria, tremor, acral paresthesias. On examination there were ataxia, briskreflexes, loss of perception. MRI revealed multiple spinal cord lesions. Electrophysiology showed demyelination. CSF was normal. Antibody assays were negative. Patient received high steroids i.v. IVIG was given periodically. Case 2: was diagnosed having CIDP when aged 34 and MS at 36. When aged 35 she developed renal failure due to nephritis. Her complaints were acral paresthesias, extremity weakness, recurrent imbalance, blurred vision. Patient exhibited tremor, ataxia, impaired sensation, areflexia. MRI showed numerous periventricular, brain stem lesions. CSF showed oligoclonal bands. CIDP of case 3: aged 48 presented with distal weakness, stepping gait, areflexia. Electrophysiology suggested demyelination, axonal loss confirmed by nerve biopsy showing epineurial T cell infiltrates. CSF had no bands. Type II diabetes was discovered one year later. Repeated IVIG gave benefit. Brain MRI showed multiple relapsing white matter lesions. Discussion(s): Few reported patients exhibit central and peripheral demyelination. Demyelination among CNS in MS spare peripheral nerves. CIDP with clinical CNS signs are rare. In our patients, neuropathy predated diagnosis of MS. There are similarities between immunepathogenesis of CIDP and MS which may result of interaction between genetic susceptibility, cellular and humoral responses directed against triggering antigens. In both an autoimmune process is initiated against same antigenic targets or by mechanism of cross reactivity and mimicry between antigens. Coincidental occurrence of multiple autoimmune disorders support concept of predisposing autoimmunity.

N2  - We focused on diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), a recently developed MRI technique that reveals the microstructures of tissues based on its ability to monitor the random movements of water molecules, for visualizing peripheral nerves after injury. The rat sciatic nerve was subjected to contusive injury, and the data obtained from diffusion tensor imaging were used to determine the tracks of nerve fibers. The DTT images clearly revealed the recovery process of the contused nerves. Immediately after the injury, fiber tracking from the designated proximal site could not be continued beyond the lesion epicenter, but the intensity improved thereafter, returning to its pre-injury level by 3 weeks later. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values, parameters for constructing DTT, were correlated with axon-related parameters, supporting the theories that axonal membranes play a major role in anisotropic water diffusion. Moreover, restoration of the FA value at the lesion epicenter was strongly correlated with parameters of motor and sensory recovery. These correlations of the FA values with both the histological and functional changes demonstrate the potential usefulness of DTT for evaluating clinical events associated with Wallerian degeneration and the regeneration of peripheral nerves.

N2  - Development of outcome measures to assess ongoing nerve regeneration in the living animal that can be translated to man can provide extremely useful tools for monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions to speed nerve regeneration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive technique that can be applied serially on the same subject to monitor pathophysiologic changes in different tissues. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an MR imaging technique, is based on the movements of water molecules within biological tissues. In neural tissues water molecules tend to move along the nerve fibers and tracts. This motion of water molecules in a preferential orientation is called 'anisotropic diffusion' and DTI can create a new image contrast that shows locations of tissues with high anisotropy, namely nerve tracts. In this proof of concept studies, we examined the use of ex vivo high-resolution DTI for imaging intact and regenerating peripheral nerves in mice and validated the MRI findings with histological studies. DTI was done on sciatic nerves with and without crush at two different time points and in four different mouse strains. DTI measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA), parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity were acquired and compared in proximal and distal segments of uninjured and crushed nerves and correlated with morphometry. A comparison of axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush showed a comparable pattern of regeneration in the four different mice strains. In crushed sciatic nerves the average parallel diffusivity was significantly lower compared to uninjured sciatic nerve segments, indicating a decreased parallel motion of water molecules along the axons. Validation studies indicate that the FA values showed highest correlation with the total number of regenerating axons and the perpendicular diffusivity was negatively correlated with axon counts. These studies indicate that DTI is a sensitive measure of axon regeneration in mouse models and establish the foundations for further development of imaging technology for application to living animals and humans.

N2  - Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (ILP) (2 mg, TNF-alpha and 100 mg, melphalan) was performed for an irresectable right thigh desmoid tumor with calf extension in a 49-year-old man. The patient had a history of four resections since the age of 19 years. Local ILP toxicity appeared with extensive edema and common peroneal neurologic impairment including paresis that remained severe 10 months later. One of the most troublesome side effects of perfusion is peripheral nerve damage, which has been reported at a rate of between 1 and 48% of perfused patients. ILP is an effective treatment in recurrence situations or where resection threatens loss of function; it, however, requires administration in specialized centers, progress in standardization and close monitoring to avoid locoregional toxicity, the mechanisms of which merit further investigation. Emergency compartmental pressure measurement may indicate fasciotomy, can be of great interest. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Acquired copper deficiency in adults is associated with a subacute to chronic progressive myeloneuropathy and optic neuropathy. Objective(s): To describe an individual after gastric bypass surgery who developed a chronic progressive myeloneuropathy, an acute optic neuropathy, along with anemia and leukopenia. Design(s): Case report. Setting(s): Academic center. Patient(s): A 55-year-old woman, following gastric bypass surgery 22 years earlier, developed progressive numbness, weakness, and sphincter disturbance over 6 years. She awoke one morning with bilateral blindness. Examination findings showed evidence of severe myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Magnetic resonance imaging, optical coherence tomography, electrophysiologic studies, nerve and muscle biopsy specimens, and vision testing. Result(s): Over 1 year of follow-up, copper infusion therapy seemed to stabilize the progressive myeloneuropathy and improved leukopenia and anemia. It had no effect on the optic neuropathy. Optic nerve tissue injury was observed on magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and on optical coherence tomography. Conclusion(s): Copper deficiency should be considered in cases of atypical optic neuropathy. Serum copper levels should be monitored in patients with a compatible neurologic syndrome who have undergone gastric bypass surgery. Although visual acuity did not improve after copper infusion in our patient, prompt recognition of copper deficiency may prevent further deterioration. ©2009 American Medical Association.

N2  - Object. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of assessing lumbar somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in central lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Methods. The latencies of lumbar SSEPs were recorded in 40 patients with central LSS, including 16 men and 24 women. The mean age of the patients was 67.3 +/- 7.4 years. The diagnosis was LSS in 23 cases and LSS associated with degenerative spondylolisthesis in 17 cases. The average duration of symptoms was 43.8 +/- 51.2 months. Twenty-two cases had bilateral and 18 cases had unilateral leg symptoms. Thirty-seven cases were associated with neurogenic intermittent claudication and the mean walking distance of patients with this condition was 246.8 +/- 232.7 m. The mean Japanese Orthopedic Association scale score, as well as the visual analog scale (VAS) scores of low-back pain, leg pain, and numbness, were 16.5 +/- 3.5, 6.0 +/- 2.5, 6.9 +/- 2.1, and 7.8 +/- 2.2, respectively. The minimal cross-sectional area of the dural sac on MR imaging was 0.44 +/- 0.21 cm2. Thirty-nine cases of cervical spondylotic myelopathy without lumbar and peripheral neuropathy were chosen as the control group. Results. The latencies of lumbar SSEPs in patients with LSS and in the control group were 23.0 +/- 2.0 ms and 21.6 +/- 1.9 ms, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the LSS and control groups (p < 0.05). The latency of lumbar SSEPs was significant correlated with the VAS score of leg numbness (p < 0.05). The latency of lumbar SSEPs in LSS was clearly delayed when the VAS score of leg numbness was >= 8 (p < 0.05). Conclusions. Lumbar SSEPs are able to detect neurological deficit in the lumbar area effectively, and they can reflect part of the subjective severity of sensory disturbance (numbness) in LSS. Both lumbar SSEPs and VAS scores of leg numbness may be useful for clinical evaluation in patients with LSS.

T1  - Reliability and Size of the Measurement Error when Determining the Cross-Sectional Area of the Tibial Nerve at the Tarsal Tunnel with Ultrasonography

N2  - An in depth analysis of the reliability of ultrasonography to measure the cross-sectional area of the tibial nerve or any other peripheral nerve is not available in the literature. This study determined the reliability and size of the measurement error of high-resolution ultrasound to measure the size of the tibial nerve at the tarsal tunnel. The cross-sectional area of the tibial nerve was measured by two experienced sonographers at 1 cm proximal to the medial malleolus. Measurements were made in 10 healthy participants without plantar heel pain. Intra and intertester reliability were determined by calculation of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), measurement error magnitude and smallest detectable difference (SDD). A direct (tracing) and indirect (ellipsoid formula) method were evaluated. Results demonstrated that the intra and intertester reliability were excellent (ICC, all >=0.86). The measurement error and SDD were very small, especially when measurements from three scans were averaged (measurement error: 0.4-0.9 mm2; SDD: 1.1-2.5 mm2). The findings of this study support the view that high-resolution ultrasound is reliable to measure the cross-sectional area of a peripheral nerve. As a result of the small measurement error, a side-to-side difference as small as ~1.8 mm2 can be interpreted meaningfully in an individual patient. This difference is much smaller than the swelling reported in the literature for patients with tibial neuropathy.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate manganese (Mn2+)-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as tools for detection of axonal injury and regeneration after intravit-real peripheral nerve graft (PNG) implantation in the rat optic nerve (ON).Materials and Methods: In adult Fischer rats, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival was evaluated in Flurogold (FG) back-filled retinal whole mounts after ON crush (ONC), intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl 2 injection (150 nmol) at 0 and 20 days post lesion (dpl). MEMRI and echo-planar DTI (DTI-EPI) was obtained of noninjured ON one day after intravitreal MnCl2 injection, and at 1 and 21 dpl after ONC, intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl2 injections given at 0 and 20 dpl. GAP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed after the last MRI. Result(s): ONC reduced RGC density in retina by 94% at 21 dpl compared to noninjured ON without MnCl2 injections. Both intravitreal PNG and intravitreal MnCl2 injections improved RGC survival in retina, which was reduced by 90% (ONC + MnCl 2), 82% (ONC+PNG), and 74% (ONC+PNG+MnCl2) compared to noninjured ON. DTI-derived parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffu-sivity, axial diffusivitylambda,and radial diffusivity lambda) were unaffected by the presence of Mn2+ in the ON. At 1 dpl, CNRMEMRI and lambdawere reduced at the injury site, while at 21 dpl they were increased at the injury site compared to values measured at 1 dpl. GAP-43 immunoreactive axons were present in the ON distal to the ONC injury site. Conclusion(s): MEMRI and DTI enabled detection of functional and structural degradation after rat ON injury, and there was correlation between the MRI-derived and immu-nohistochemical measures of axon regeneration. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Globoid cell leukodystrophy is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase. In both human patients and the authentic murine Twitcher model, pathological findings include demyelination as well as axonal damage in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has emerged as a powerful noninvasive technique that is sensitive to these white matter disease processes. Increases in radial diffusivity (lambda) and decreases in axial diffusivity (lambda) correlate with histopathological evidence of demyelination and axonal damage, respectively. Compared to age-matched, normal littermates, DTI of optic nerve and trigeminal nerve in end-stage Twitcher mice displayed a statistically significant increase in lambda and decrease in lambda, consistent with previously characterized demyelination and axonal damage in these regions. In the Twitcher spinal cord, a statistically significant decrease in lambda was identified in both the dorsal and ventrolateral white matter, relative to normal controls. These results were consistent with immunofluorescence evidence of axonal damage in these areas as detected by staining for nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI32). Increase in lambda in Twitcher spinal cord white matter relative to normal controls reached statistical significance in the dorsal columns and approached statistical significance in the ventrolateral region. Correlative reduced levels of myelin basic protein were detected by immunofluorescent staining in both these white matter regions in the Twitcher spinal cord. Fractional anisotropy, a nonspecific but sensitive indicator of white matter disease, was significantly reduced in the optic nerve, trigeminal nerve, and throughout the spinal cord white matter of Twitcher mice, relative to normal controls. This first reported application of spinal cord DTI in the setting of GLD holds potential as a noninvasive, quantitative assay of therapeutic efficacy in future treatment studies.

N2  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic infection of the brain caused by the JC-virus. Both a decreased cellular or humoral immune response can increase the susceptibility for JC-virus induced PML. Not only HIV infected people are at risk, a wide range of otherwise immune compromised patients are a potential target for this virus. This report of five PML patients shows the importance of a clinician's familiarity with this disease and it's presenting symptoms. The presenting symptoms of PML can sometimes mimic worsening of the underlying disease. Although different therapeutic strategies have been tried, the outcomes remain very poor. In this series, treatment with cidofovir appears not to be effective in treating PML, neither in HIV positive nor HIV negative patients. Experimental therapy with leflunomide, after tapering of the immunosuppressive medication, did change the natural course of PML in one patient. © 2008 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

N2  - The median nerve is one of the most commonly affected peripheral nerves in various pathologies such as entrapment syndromes or transections. The diagnostic procedures applied in these situations are electromyography, physical examination methods, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used mostly in imaging the central nervous system (CNS) to visualize white matter tracts. Several studies have shown the clinical applications of DTI in neuronal disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and CNS tumors. Recently, peripheral nerves have been visualized with DTI. Also, in several pathologies such as carpal tunnel syndrome and transection of the median nerve, on postoperative follow-up anisotropy indexes were shown to be affected. However, new studies with larger series are needed. Copyright © 2009 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

T1  - T2 relaxometry of human median nerve
A1  - Gambarota, Giulio 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - This article examines the T2 relaxation characteristics of the median nerve. Knowledge of the T2 relaxation time is essential to optimize clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and to enhance the visibility of pathophysiological changes in tissues. The T2 relaxation time of the median nerve is short relative to the T2 of other tissues like white and gray matter, for instance, and it decreases with increasing field strength of the MR scanner. A T2 relaxation time of ~50 milliseconds (ms) and ~20 ms were reported at 1.5 T and 7 T, respectively. Detailed measurements at 3.0 T revealed a biexponential decay characterized by two T2 components, at ~30 ms and ~100 ms, with normalized amplitudes of ~80% and ~20%, respectively. These two components possibly result from spatial compartmentation of water into intra-axonal and interaxonal spaces. The ability to assess microanatomical compartments within the median nerve could provide a method to study in vivo biophysical properties of nerves and could offer a means to investigate neurodegenerative diseases.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Every year, manufacturers of MRI machines introduce new sequences. Most of them result in improved spatial resolution and signal contrast, occasionally with a decrease in sequence duration or MRI time (as when a single 3D sequence is substituted for three 2D sequences). Some sequences that are specifically designed to obtain structural or functional information about a specific tissue (ultrashort TE, T2 mapping, spectro-MRI) are used only for research purposes. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and tractography constitute an original microarchitectural approach based on water molecule diffusion. These methods are nearly ready to be introduced into clinical practice. They are discussed in this article. © 2009.

N2  - Background: The onset of progressive cerebellar ataxia in early childhood is considered a key feature of ataxiatelangiectasia (A-T), accompanied by ocular apraxia, telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, cancer susceptibility and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Method(s): We describe the clinical features and course of three Mennonite children who were diagnosed with A-T following the completion of therapy for lymphoid malignancies. Result(s): Prior to cancer therapy, all had non-progressive atypical neurological abnormalities, with onset by age 30 months, including dysarthria, dyskinesia, hypotonia and/or dystonia, without telangiectasias. Cerebellar ataxia was noted in only one of the children and was mild until his death at age eight years. None had severe infections. All three children were "cured" of their lymphoid malignancies, but experienced severe adverse effects from the treatments administered. The two children who received cranial irradiation developed supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the brain, an association not previously described, with fatal outcomes. Conclusion(s): The range of neurological presentations of A-T is broad. Ataxia and telangiectasias may be minimal or absent and the course seemingly non-progressive. The diagnosis of A-T should be considered in all children with neuromotor dysfunction or peripheral neuropathy, particularly those who develop lymphoid malignancies. The consequences of missing the diagnosis may be dire. Radiation therapy and radiomimetic drugs should be avoided in individuals with A-T.

T1  - Magnetic resonance neurography and diffusion tensor imaging: Origins, history, and clinical impact of the first 50 000 cases with an assessment of efficacy and utility in a prospective 5000-patient study group
A1  - Filler, Aaron 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Methods were invented that made it possible to image peripheral nerves in the body and to image neural tracts in the brain. The history, physical basis, and dyadic tensor concept underlying the methods are reviewed. Over a 15-year period, these techniques - magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and diffusion tensor imaging - were deployed in the clinical and research community in more than 2500 published research reports and applied to approximately 50 000 patients. Within this group, approximately 5000 patients having MRN were carefully tracked on a prospective basis. METHOD(S): A uniform Neurography imaging methodology was applied in the study group, and all images were reviewed and registered by referral source, clinical indication, efficacy of imaging, and quality. Various classes of image findings were identified and subjected to a variety of small targeted prospective outcome studies. Those findings demonstrated to be clinically significant were then tracked in the larger clinical volume data set. RESULT(S): MRN demonstrates mechanical distortion of nerves, hyperintensity consistent with nerve irritation, nerve swelling, discontinuity, relations of nerves to masses, and image features revealing distortion of nerves at entrapment points. These findings are often clinically relevant and warrant full consideration in the diagnostic process. They result in specific pathological diagnoses that are comparable to electrodiagnostic testing in clinical efficacy. A review of clinical outcome studies with diffusion tensor imaging also shows convincing utility. CONCLUSION(S): MRN and diffusion tensor imaging neural tract imaging have been validated as indispensable clinical diagnostic methods that provide reliable anatomic pathological information. There is no alternative diagnostic method in many situations. With the elapsing of 15 years, tens of thousands of imaging studies, and thousands of publications, these methods should no longer be considered experimental.

N2  - We applied diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), a recently developed MRI technique that reveals the microstructures of tissues based on its ability to monitor the random movements of water molecules, to the visualization of peripheral nerves after injury. The rat sciatic nerve was subjected to contusive injury, and the data obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to determine the tracks of nerve fibers (DTT). The DTT images obtained using the fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold value of 0.4 clearly revealed the recovery process of the contused nerves. Immediately after the injury, fiber tracking from the designated proximal site could not be continued beyond the lesion epicenter, but the intensity improved thereafter, returning to its pre-injury level by 3 weeks later. We compared the FA value, a parameter computed from the DTT data, with the results of histological and functional examinations of the injured nerves, during recovery. The FA values of the peripheral nerves were more strongly correlated with axon-related (axon density and diameter) than with myelin-related (myelin density and thickness) parameters, supporting the theories that axonal membranes play a major role in anisotropic water diffusion and that myelination can modulate the degree of anisotropy. Moreover, restoration of the FA value at the lesion epicenter was strongly correlated with parameters of motor and sensory functional recovery. These correlations of the FA values with both the histological and functional changes demonstrate the potential usefulness of DTT for evaluating clinical events associated with Wallerian degeneration and the regeneration of peripheral nerves. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Although the diffusivity and anisotropy of water has been investigated thoroughly in ordered axonal systems (i.e., nervous tissue), there have been very few studies on the directional dependence of diffusion of metabolites. In this study, the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (Trace/3 ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the intracellular metabolites N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (tCr), choline (Cho), taurine (Tau), and glutamate and glutamine (Glx) were measured parallel and perpendicular to the length of excised frog sciatic nerve using a water suppressed, diffusion-weighted, spin-echo pulse sequence at 18.8 T. The degree of anisotropy (FA) of NAA (0.41 +/- 0.09) was determined to be less than tCr (0.59 +/- 0.07) and Cho (0.61 +/- 0.11), which is consistent with previously reported human studies of white matter. In contrast, Glx diffusion was found to be almost isotropic with an FA value of 0.20 +/- 0.06. The differences of FA between the metabolites is most likely due to their differing micro-environments and could be beneficial as an indicator of compartment specific changes with disease, information not readily available with water diffusion. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Important new information regarding neurologic complications of HIV disease was presented at the 2007 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. In addition to presentations on pathogenesis and treatment of neurologic complications, the conference included findings that have implications for the management of HIV disease outside the nervous system. Key findings included that the distribution of antiretrovirals into the central nervous system may influence the effectiveness of treatment outside this protected compartment; that postponing initiation of therapy until blood CD4+ counts fall to 300 cells/mm3 may increase the risk for HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment but interruption of antiretroviral therapy in individuals with high CD4+ counts may have neuropsychologic benefits; that substantial changes, including macrophage activation and neuronal injury can occur shortly after HIV transmission; that HIV can influence neural progenitor cells to decrease neuronal differentiation; that newer neuroimaging technologies, such as diffusion tensor imaging and blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging can identify important effects of HIV on the brain such as alterations in cerebral oxygen consumption; that serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors may reduce HIV RNA levels in cerebral spinal fluid; and that erythropoietin and the non-immunosuppressive immunophilin ligand, GPI-1046, may improve HIV-associated injury of peripheral nerves. The conference also included an important focus on JC virus encephalitis (also known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy).

N2  - Perineuroma, rare in children, presents as a painless mononeuropathy of a major nerve trunk. Resection of the lesion with end-to-end sural nerve grafting appears to be the treatment of choice. This technique is not recommended if the unhealthy segment of nerve is too long or if spinal roots are involved. However, in children, reports of direct MR evaluation of nerve trunks and of the exiting nerve roots are limited. We report a 7-year-old girl with an intramural sciatic nerve perineuroma in whom the diagnosis was made by MRI and confirmed by biopsy. The MR protocol combining 3-D T2-W STIR SPACE, fat-saturated gadolinium-enhanced T1-W images, and diffusion tensor imaging with tractography was a valuable tool for depicting peripheral nerve and roots in order to plan surgical treatment. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Wallerian degeneration is the degeneration of the nerve fiber distally to damage of the axon. It classically has been described in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), but also takes place in the central nervous system (CNS). Wallerian degeneration in the CNS is much slower than in the PNS taking months to years and a secondary regeneration of the distal nerve fiber does not take place in the CNS. Thus, Wallerian degeneration may be a crucial factor influencing the functional loss after brain damage and can be detected using modern MR technniques. This article reviews the process of Wallerian degeneration in the CNS and the possibilities of imaging Wallerian degeneration in the human brain using MRI. While a decrease of signal intensities in proton-density-weighted images can be detected after 25 days and increased signal intensities in T2-weigthed images can be seen after 80 days, diffusion sensor imaging (DTI) can detect Wallerian degeneration much earlier. Several studies have demonstrated the decrease of fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corticospinal tracts after infarction of the medial cerebral artery (MCA) 2-6 month after stroke, 2-6 weeks after stroke, and 2-16 days after stroke. Moreover, a continuous decrease of FA over time in serial DT measurements after MCA infarction could be demonstrated. Changes in FA seem to be a parameter to quantify degeneration of tracts over time in single, compact fiber bundles such as the corticospinal tract, cerebellar peduncles, spinal cord white matter, the optic radiation, and corpus callosum. Thus, the detection and quantification of Wallerian degeneration may be a tool tor monitoring functional loss or functional regain after brain damage. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

T1  - Time-Series Modeling of Multiple Sclerosis Disease Activity: A Promising Window on Disease Progression and Repair Potential?
A1  - Meier, Dominik S.

A1  - Weiner, Howard L. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - This article discusses and reviews advanced forms of serial morphometry in the context of a disease progression model in multiple sclerosis (MS). This model of disease activity distinguishes between overall disease activity and the proportion thereof that becomes permanent damage. This translates into a progression model that features a repair potential, which, when exhausted, marks the conversion or progression from relapsing to progressive disease. The level of repair capacity at a given time determines the rate of progression. Both clinical and MRI variables appear to be in support of such a model. We examine possible MRI markers for this repair capacity, particularly the short-term behavior of new MRI lesions, quantified by methods of time-series analysis-that is, capturing lesion dynamics in the form of MRI intensity change directly, rather than shape or volume change. Lower rates of individual lesion recovery may represent lower repair and greater proximity to a progressive stage. Individuals with low transient lesion turnover appear to undergo more rapid progression and atrophy. Because disease-modifying therapies aim to alter the pathophysiological chain of inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss, a therapeutic effect may therefore be more readily apparent as a change in lesion dynamics and recovery rate and level, rather than a change in total lesion burden or enhancing lesion number. © 2007 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

N2  - The ability to measure myelin in vivo has great consequences for furthering our knowledge of normal development, as well as for understanding a wide range of neurological disorders. The following review summarizes the current state of myelin imaging using MR. We consider five MR techniques that have been used to study myelin: 1) conventional MR, 2) MR spectroscopy, 3) diffusion, 4) magnetization transfer, and 5) T2 relaxation. Fundamental studies involving peripheral nerve and MR/histology comparisons have aided in the interpretation and validation of MR data. We highlight a number of important findings related to myelin development, damage, and repair, and we conclude with a critical summary of the current techniques available and their potential to image myelin in vivo. © 2007 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

T1  - Neuroimaging: Visualising the brain in pain
A1  - May, A. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - The neuroimaging of experimental and clinical pain has revolutionised our understanding of the physiological responses to pain and paved the way for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain syndromes. Extensive research on the central mechanisms regarding the sensory-discriminative dimensions of pain have revealed a complex network of cortical and subcortical brain structures involved in the transmission and integration of pain, the so-called pain matrix. Although brain imaging and pharmacological studies have generated some insight into the circuitry that may be involved in the generation of chronic pain symptoms, further research into brain imaging of chronic pain is clearly warranted. However, modern neuroimaging suggests that the chronification of pain (and headaches) involves functional and structural plasticity of both the central and peripheral nervous system. © Springer-VerlagItalia 2007.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Peripheral nerve disorders may be classified into compressive or entrapment neuropathies and non-compressive neuropathies. Muscle denervation recognized on MRI may be a useful sign in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve disorders. Acute or subacute denervation results in prolonged T2 relaxation time, producing increased signal in skeletal muscle on short tau inversion-recovery and fat-suppressed T2-weighted images. Chronic denervation produces fatty atrophy of skeletal muscles, resulting in increased muscle signal on T1-weighted images. This review will outline and illustrate the various ways that muscle denervation as seen on MRI may assist in the diagnosis and localization of peripheral nerve disorders. © 2007 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.

N2  - Measurements of T2 relaxation times in tissues have provided a unique, noninvasive method to investigate the microenvironment of water molecules in vivo. As more clinical imaging is performed at higher field strengths, tissue relaxation times need to be reassessed in order to optimize tissue contrast. The purpose of this study was to investigate the water proton T2 relaxation time in human median nerve at 7 T. High-resolution images of the wrist were obtained using a home-built dedicated microstrip coil. Gradient echo images provided a good anatomical delineation of the wrist structure, with a clear definition of the median nerve, tendons, bone, and connective tissue within the wrist in an acquisition time of 2 min. Measurements of the T2 relaxation time were performed with a spin echo imaging sequence. The T2 relaxation time of the median nerve was 18.3 +/- 1.9 ms, which is significantly shorter than the T2 measured in previous studies performed at 1.5 T and 3 T. Further, the T2 relaxation time of the median nerve is shorter than the T2 relaxation time of other tissues, such as brain tissue, at the same field strength. Since the T2 relaxation time of water protons is sensitive to the water microenvironment, relaxation measurements and, in general, a more quantitative magnetic resonance imaging approach might help in detecting and investigating diseases of peripheral nervous system, such as compressive and inflammatory neuropathies, in humans. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Diffusion-direction-dependent imaging: a novel MRI approach for peripheral nerve imaging
A1  - Skorpil, Mikael

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - A novel magnetic resonance imaging approach, called diffusion-direction-dependent imaging (DDI), is introduced. Due to inherent anisotropic diffusion properties, peripheral nerves can be visualized on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The largest signal attenuation on DTI correlates with the direction of a nerve fiber, and the least signal attenuation correlates with the direction perpendicular to the nerve fiber. Since low signal-to-noise ratio is a concern in peripheral nerve DTI, we explored a new approach focusing on the perpendicular diffusion direction. A 36-gradient diffusion direction scheme was used. A mean expected curve specific for peripheral nerves was calculated based on the sciatic nerve and its division into the common peroneal nerve and the tibial nerve in three healthy volunteers. By a simple postprocessing method, a comparison of the mean expected curve and the measured curve was made voxel by voxel, and the sciatic nerve and its division were reconstructed, excluding other tissues. More studies are needed to investigate whether other postprocessing methods or other diffusion direction schemes are more suited for peripheral nerve imaging with DDI. Further studies may also be of interest to investigate whether DDI can be a complementary method to conventional T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences in the imaging of peripheral nerve pathology or even in the visualization of other tissues, possibly with different diffusion direction schemes. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - A phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy of administering daily thalidomide concomitantly with radiation and continuing for up to 1 year following radiation in children with brain stem gliomas (BSG) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Secondary objectives were to obtain preliminary evidence of biologic activity of thalidomide and to evaluate toxicities from chronic administration of thalidomide in this population. Thirteen patients (2-14 years old) with newly diagnosed BSG (12 patients) or GBM (one patient) were enrolled between July 1999 and June 2000. All patients received focal radiotherapy to a total dose of 5,580 cGy. Thalidomide was administered once daily beginning on the first day of radiation and continued for 12 months or until the patient came off study. The starting dose was 12 mg/kg (rounded down to the nearest 50 mg) and was increased by 20% weekly, if tolerated, to 24 mg/kg or 1,000 mg (whichever was lower). Advanced imaging techniques and urine and serum analysis for anti-angiogenic markers were performed in some patients in an attempt to correlate changes with clinical effect of therapy. No patients completed the planned 12 months of thalidomide therapy and all have since died of disease progression. The median duration of therapy was 5 months (range 2-11 months). Nine patients came off study for progressive disease (PD), three patients due to toxicity and one patient withdrew consent. Several patients on this study required more extended courses of high dose steroids than would have been otherwise expected for this population due to significant peritumoral edema and necrosis. No consistent pattern emerged from the biologic correlative studies from 11 patients. However, advanced imaging with techniques such as MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were helpful in distinguishing growing tumor from treatment effect and necrosis in some patients. The median time to progression (TTP) was 5 months (range 2-11 months) and the median time to death (TTD) was 9 months (range 5-17 months). In this small patient sample adding thalidomide to radiation did not improve TTP or TTD from historical controls, however, toxicity appeared to be increased. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

N2  - OBJECTIVE - The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is poorly understood. We have recently reported a significant reduction in spinal cord cross-sectional area at the stage of clinically detectable DPN. In this study, we investigated whether spinal cord atrophy occurs in early (subclinical) DPN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Eighty-one male type 1 diabetic subjects, 24 nondiabetic control subjects, and 8 subjects with hereditary sensory motor neuropathy (HSMN) type 1A underwent detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments. Diabetic subjects were subsequently divided into three groups based on neuropathy severity (19 with no DPN, 23 with subclinical DPN, and 39 with clinically detectable DPN). All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and cord area measurements at disc level C2/C3. RESULTS - Mean corrected spinal cord area index (SCAI) (corrected for age, height, and weight) was 67.5 mm [95% CI 64.1-70.9] in diabetic subjects without DPN. Those with subclinical (62.4mm[59.5- 65.3]) and clinically detectable DPN (57.2mm[54.9 -59.6]) had lower mean SCAIs compared with subjects with no DPN (P = 0.03 and P < 0.001, respectively). No significant difference was found between diabetic subjects without DPN and nondiabetic control subjects (69.2 mm [66.3-72.0], P = 0.47). Mean SCAIs in subjects with HSMN type 1A (71.07 mm[65.3-76.9]) were not significantly different from those for nondiabetic control subjects and diabetic subjects without DPN. Among diabetic subjects, SCAI was significantly related to sural sensory conduction velocities and the Neuropathy Composite and Symptom Scores. CONCLUSIONS - Spinal cord involvement occurs early in DPN. There is also a significant relation between reduction in SCAI and neurophysiological assessments of DPN. © 2006 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - 1. Foot infections in patients with diabetes cause substantial morbidity and frequent visits to health care professionals and may lead to amputation of a lower extremity. 2. Diabetic foot infections require attention to local (foot) and systemic (metabolic) issues and coordinated management, preferably by a multidisciplinary foot-care team (A-II) (). The team managing these infections should include, or have ready access to, an infectious diseases specialist or a medical microbiologist (B-II). 3. The major predisposing factor to these infections is foot ulceration, which is usually related to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral vascular disease and various immunological disturbances play a secondary role. 4. Aerobic Gram-positive cocci (especially Staphylococcus aureus) are the predominant pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have chronic wounds or who have recently received antibiotic therapy may also be infected with Gram-negative rods, and those with foot ischemia or gangrene may have obligate anaerobic pathogens. 5. Wound infections must be diagnosed clinically on the basis of local (and occasionally systemic) signs and symptoms of inflammation. Laboratory (including microbiological) investigations are of limited use for diagnosing infection, except in cases of osteomyelitis (B-II). 6. Send appropriately obtained specimens for culture before starting empirical antibiotic therapy in all cases of infection, except perhaps those that are mild and previously untreated (B-III). Tissue specimens obtained by biopsy, ulcer curettage, or aspiration are preferable to wound swab specimens (A-I). 7. Imaging studies may help diagnose or better define deep, soft-tissue purulent collections and are usually needed to detect pathological findings in bone. Plain radiography may be adequate in many cases, but MRI (in preference to isotope scanning) is more sensitive and specific, especially for detection of soft-tissue lesions (A-I). 8. Infections should be categorized by their severity on the basis of readily assessable clinical and laboratory features (B-II). Most important among these are the specific tissues involved, the adequacy of arterial perfusion, and the presence of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability. Categorization helps determine the degree of risk to the patient and the limb and, thus, the urgency and venue of management. 9. Available evidence does not support treating clinically uninfected ulcers with antibiotic therapy (D-III). Antibiotic therapy is necessary for virtually all infected wounds, but it is often insufficient without appropriate wound care. 10. Select an empirical antibiotic regimen on the basis of the severity of the infection and the likely etiologic agent(s) (B-II). Therapy aimed solely at aerobic Gram-positive cocci may be sufficient for mild-to-moderate infections in patients who have not recently received antibiotic therapy (A-II). Broad-spectrum empirical therapy is not routinely required but is indicated for severe infections, pending culture results and antibiotic susceptibility data (B-III). Take into consideration any recent antibiotic therapy and local antibiotic susceptibility data, especially the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms. Definitive therapy should be based on both the culture results and susceptibility data and the clinical response to the empirical regimen (C-III). 11. There is only limited evidence with which to make informed choices among the various topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotic agents. Virtually all severe and some moderate infections require parenteral therapy, at least initially (C-III). Highly bioavailable oral antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections, including some cases of osteomyelitis (A-II). Topical therapy may be used for some mild superficial infections (B-I). 12. Continue antibiotic therapy until there is evidence that the infection has resolved but not necessarily until a wound has healed. Suggestions for the duration of antibiotic therapy are as follows: for mild infections, 12 weeks usually suffices, but some require an additional 12 weeks; for moderate and severe infections, usually 24 weeks is sufficient, depending on the structures involved, the adequacy of debridement, the type of soft-tissue wound cover, and wound vascularity (A-II); and for osteomyelitis, generally at least 46 weeks is required, but a shorter duration is sufficient if the entire infected bone is removed, and probably a longer duration is needed if infected bone remains (B-II). 13. If an infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to 1 antibiotic courses, consider discontinuing all antimicrobials and, after a few days, obtaining optimal culture specimens (C-III). 14. Seek surgical consultation and, when needed, intervention for infections accompanied by a deep abscess, extensive bone or joint involvement, crepitus, substantial necrosis or gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis (A-II). Evaluating the limb's arterial supply and revascularizing when indicated are particularly important. Surgeons with experience and interest in the field should be recruited by the foot-care team, if possible. 15. Providing optimal wound care, in addition to appropriate antibiotic treatment of the infection, is crucial for healing (A-I). This includes proper wound cleansing, debridement of any callus and necrotic tissue, and, especially, off-loading of pressure. There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific wound dressing or any type of wound healing agents or products for infected foot wounds. 16. Patients with infected wounds require early and careful follow-up observation to ensure that the selected medical and surgical treatment regimens have been appropriate and effective (B-III). 17. Studies have not adequately defined the role of most adjunctive therapies for diabetic foot infections, but systematic reviews suggest that granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help prevent amputations (B-I). These treatments may be useful for severe infections or for those that have not adequately responded to therapy, despite correcting for all amenable local and systemic adverse factors. 18. Spread of infection to bone (osteitis or osteomyelitis) may be difficult to distinguish from noninfectious osteoarthropathy. Clinical examination and imaging tests may suffice, but bone biopsy is valuable for establishing the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, for defining the pathogenic organism(s), and for determining the antibiotic susceptibilities of such organisms (B-II). 19. Although this field has matured, further research is much needed. The committee especially recommends that adequately powered prospective studies be undertaken to elucidate and validate systems for classifying infection, diagnosing osteomyelitis, defining optimal antibiotic regimens in various situations, and clarifying the role of surgery in treating osteomyelitis (A-III).

N2  - The in vivo assessment of axonal projections of the peripheral nervous system has been severely limited by the lack of noninvasive techniques. We examined whether MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking of the human median nerve is feasible. The median nerve was examined with a 3-T MRI scanner in wrists of three healthy volunteers and the wrist of a patient after median nerve repair. In vivo three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of axonal projections of the median nerve could be achieved in healthy volunteers with intact median nerves and a patient with a transected median nerve using diffusion tensor imaging combined with fiber tracking. The median nerve could be visualized and correlated well to the expected location on T1-weighted images in the patient and all volunteers. The transected median nerve in the patient could be detected up to the site of repair one month postoperatively, whereas the nerve could not be detected more distally immediately after repair. Two months postoperatively, it could clearly be tracked more distally, indicating nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging can detect the median nerve in healthy individuals as well as up to the lesion site in a patient with a complete transection of the median nerve. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Aims/hypothesis: In addition to nephropathy, retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy, a microvascular complication of type 1 diabetes that may be tentatively referred to as 'diabetic encephalopathy' has gained increasing attention. There is growing evidence that lowered cognitive performance in patients with type 1 diabetes is related to chronic hyperglycaemia rather than recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, as previously speculated. The aim of our study was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to establish whether long-term hyperglycaemia, resulting in advanced retinopathy, contributes to structural changes in the brain (reduced grey matter). Subjects, materials and methods: We applied voxel-based morphometry on magnetic resonance images to compare grey matter density (GMD) between three groups of participants. GMD is used as a marker of cortical atrophy. We compared 13 type 1 diabetic patients with a microvascular complication (i.e. proliferative retinopathy) with 18 type 1 diabetic patients who did not have retinopathy in order to assess the effects of microvascular changes on GMD. Both patient groups were compared with 21 healthy control subjects to assess the effect of diabetes in itself. Result(s): Patients with diabetic retinopathy showed reduced GMD in the right inferior frontal gyrus and right occipital lobe compared both with patients without retinopathy and with healthy controls (p<0.05). Conclusions/interpretation: Our data show that patients with type 1 diabetes, who, as a consequence of chronic hyperglycaemia, had developed advanced retinopathy, also showed increased focal cortical atrophy on brain MRI. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

N2  - Objective: We studied whether distal peripheral nerves could be imaged using quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a 3-T MRI scanner, and visualized using tractography. Method(s): Altogether 6 healthy subjects were studied. The diffusion was quantified with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and the direction of main diffusivity was visualized with color-coded orientation maps and tractography. Result(s): We present the first DTI and tractography results of human distal peripheral nerves. The courses of median, ulnar, and radial nerves in the upper limb and of tibial and peroneal nerves in the lower limb were first analyzed quantifying ADC and FA, and then visualized in 3D with tractography. Tractography illustrated nicely the 3D courses of both upper and lower limb nerves which were reliably distinguished from the surrounding muscle tissue and ligaments. Conclusion(s): Quantitative DTI and tractography can be used to image and visualize distal peripheral nerves. Significance: DTI is a quantitative method that could provide useful information for the diagnosis and follow-up of nerve lesions, entrapments, and regeneration. Peripheral nerves as well-delineated structures also containing abundant branching into bundles of different diameters, could be used as 'living phantoms' for testing and validating different tractography methods. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

T1  - Neurophysiological assessment of trigeminal nerve reflexes in disorders of central and peripheral nervous system
A1  - Valls-Sole, Josep 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The trigeminal nerve and nuclei (the trigeminal complex) are unique in the human body with regard to their anatomical and physiological characteristics. They are also special regarding the lesions in which they are involved, both at the peripheral level because of the susceptibility of some terminal branches, and at the nuclei because of their large size and the large amount of connections with other centers. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging studies are often not sufficiently informative to demonstrate very tiny lesions that could be responsible for an important damage in the brainstem. Therefore, clinical neurophysiology and specifically, the techniques used in the study of the trigeminal functions, remain as convenient diagnostic and research tools to document clinically evident lesions or uncover subclinical abnormalities. This review is focussed on the clinical applicability of the study of trigeminal reflexes, including methods employed in the documentation of focal lesions of peripheral branches, trigeminal involvement of peripheral neuropathies, specific lesions of the trigeminal ganglia, central nervous dysfunctions causing abnormalities in the excitability of trigeminal neurons, and the possible use of trigeminal nerve reflexes in the study of facial pain syndromes and headache. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

N2  - OBJECTIVE - To characterize structural changes and the metabolic profile of foot muscles and correlate them with diabetic neuropathy measurements using phosphorus-31 (31P) rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We studied 12 control subjects, 9 nonneuropathic diabetic patients, and 12 neuropathic diabetic patients using 31P RARE and proton ( 1H) MRI at 3 Tesla. The ratio of the total cross-sectional area of the foot to that of the muscle tissue was calculated from transaxial 1H and 31P images. The average 31P concentration across the metatarsal head region was measured from the 31P images. RESULTS - The muscle area-to-total area ratio differed among all three groups (means +/- SD): 0.55 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.06 for control, nonneuropathic, and neuropathic subjects, respectively (P < 0.0001). The average 31P concentration also differed among all groups: 27.7 +/- 3.8 vs. 21.7 +/- 4.8 vs. 7.9 +/- 8.8 mmol/l for control, nonneuropathic, and neuropathic subjects (P < 0.0001). The muscle area-to-total area ratio strongly correlated with clinical measurements: Neuropathy Disability Score, r = -0.83, P < 0.0001; vibration perception threshold, r = -0.79, P < 0.0001; and Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, r = -0.87, P < 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS - Small muscle atrophy is present in diabetes before clinical peripheral neuropathy can be detected using standard clinical techniques. The 31P RARE MRI method evaluates the severity of muscle atrophy, even in the early stages when neuropathy is absent. This technique may prove to be a useful diagnostic tool in identifying early-stage diabetic foot problems. © 2005 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - "Pure" adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is the noninflammatory myeloneuropathic variant of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, where the disease process appears to be restricted to spinal cord tracts and peripheral nerves. The absence of obvious brain involvement makes it distinct from the inflammatory cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. However, some pure AMN patients later experience development of cerebral demyelination, but little is known about die extent of brain involvement in pure AMN patients who have normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. We used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate possible occult cerebral abnormalities in such pure AMN patients. Fractional anisotropy and trace were studied in three-dimensional reconstructions of white matter tracts commonly involved in cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Results demonstrated reduced fractional anisotropy and increased trace in bilateral corticospinal tracts and genu of corpus callosum (p < 0.05). Diffusion tensor imaging-based three-dimensional fiber tracking showed occult tract-specific cerebral microstructural abnormalities in pure AMN patients who had a normal conventional brain magnetic resonance image. Corticospinal tract abnormalities could reflect a centripetal extension of spinal cord long-tract distal axonopathy. Accompanying abnormalities in genu of corpus callosum indicate that the disease pathology in pure AMN may not be limited to spinal cord long tracts alone, although the involvement of the latter is most prominent and severe. © 2005 American Neurological Association.

N2  - Purpose: To examine the possibility of performing high-resolution MRI (microneurography) on peripheral nerves. Material(s) and Method(s): A specific radio frequency (RF) coil was developed to probe the human median nerve at a magnetic field strength of 9.4 T and tested on three excised samples by acquiring microneurograms. Result(s): The microneurograms revealed neuronal tissue constituents at subfascicular level. The contrast features on proton-density and T1- and T2-weighted images were described and compared. The microscopic water movement was quantified using diffusion weighting parallel and orthogonal to the neuronal fiber orientation. The characteristics of anisotropic diffusion in the median nerve were comparable to those reported from other biological tissues (white matter and kidney). Conclusion(s): The results overall suggest that microneurography might provide new noninvasive insights into microscopic gross anatomy of the peripheral nerve, injury evaluation, and efficacy of repair, although the feasibility at current clinically relevant field strengths is yet to be determined. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - We examined if MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking could be performed on the sciatic nerve. In 3 healthy volunteers the proximal thigh was examined on a 1.5-Tesla MR-scanner with a 2-channel phased-array coil. Though inherently susceptible to motion, field inhomogeneities, and fast T 2-relaxation of the diffusion imaging technique, the sciatic nerve could be detected and correlated to T2-weighted images in all 3 subjects. Further investigations need to be done to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to see if smaller peripheral nerves than the sciatic nerve can be detected. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Imaging of peripheral nerve lesions

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Purpose of review: Clinical investigations of peripheral nerve lesions routinely involve nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Imaging studies are often used to exclude focal mass lesions or external compression and to visualize muscle atrophy. More recently, it has been recognized that magnetic resonance imaging can identify changes in peripheral nerves and secondary neurogenic alterations in skeletal muscle, which may significantly enhance its use in the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. Recent findings: Acute axonal nerve lesions cause a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images at and distal to the lesion site, which correlates with Wallerian degeneration and nerve oedema. Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles provide an exciting new tool to detect the invasion of macrophages into the degenerating nerve distal to an axonal lesion. Prolongation of the T2 relaxation time and gadolinium enhancement of denervated muscle develop in parallel to the development of spontaneous activity on electromyography, and are probably the consequence of capillary enlargement and increased muscular blood volume. Summary: Magnetic resonance imaging supplements the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. An advantage over clinical neurophysiological investigations is that it is operator independent and painless. It can identify axonal damage and may thus help to identify a lesion site precisely, where fractionated nerve conduction studies are not applicable. Novel contrast media may potentially be used to detect pathophysiologically relevant mechanisms such as infiltration of the nerve by macrophages. Magnetic resonance imaging also has the advantage of providing a lasting detailed topographical picture of regional variations and avoids localization errors of muscles in electromyography. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Foot infections in patients with diabetes cause substantial morbidity and frequent visits to health care professionals and may lead to amputation of a lower extremity. Diabetic foot infections require attention to local (foot) and systemic (metabolic) issues and coordinated management, preferably by a multidisciplinary foot-care team (A-II) (table 1). The team managing these infections should include, or have ready access to, an infectious diseases specialist or a medical microbiologist (B-II). The major predisposing factor to these infections is foot ulceration, which is usually related to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral vascular disease and various immunological disturbances play a secondary role. Aerobic gram-positive cocci (especially Staphylococcus aureus) are the predominant pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have chronic wounds or who have recently received antibiotic therapy may also be infected with gram-negative rods, and those with foot ischemia or gangrene may have obligate anaerobic pathogens. Wound infections must be diagnosed clinically on the basis of local (and occasionally systemic) signs and symptoms of inflammation. Laboratory (including microbiological) investigations are of limited use for diagnosing infection, except in cases of osteomyelitis (B-II). Send appropriately obtained specimens for culture prior to starting empirical antibiotic therapy in all cases of infection, except perhaps those that are mild and previously untreated (B-III). Tissue specimens obtained by biopsy, ulcer curettage, or aspiration are preferable to wound swab specimens (A-I). Imaging studies may help diagnose or better define deep, soft-tissue purulent collections and are usually needed to detect pathological findings in bone. Plain radiography may be adequate in many cases, but MRI (in preference to isotope scanning) is more sensitive and specific, especially for detection of soft-tissue lesions (A-I). Infections should be categorized by their severity on the basis of readily assessable clinical and laboratory features (B-II). Most important among these are the specific tissues involved, the adequacy of arterial perfusion, and the presence of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability. Categorization helps determine the degree of risk to the patient and the limb and, thus, the urgency and venue of management. Available evidence does not support treating clinically uninfected ulcers with antibiotic therapy (D-III). Antibiotic therapy is necessary for virtually all infected wounds, but it is often insufficient without appropriate wound care. Select an empirical antibiotic regimen on the basis of the severity of the infection and the likely etiologic agent(s) (B-II). Therapy aimed solely at aerobic gram-positive cocci may be sufficient for mild-to-moderate infections in patients who have not recently received antibiotic therapy (A-II). Broad-spectrum empirical therapy is not routinely required but is indicated for severe infections, pending culture results and antibiotic susceptibility data (B-III). Take into consideration any recent antibiotic therapy and local antibiotic susceptibility data, especially the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms. Definitive therapy should be based on both the culture results and susceptibility data and the clinical response to the empirical regimen (C-III). There is only limited evidence with which to make informed choices among the various topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotic agents. Virtually all severe and some moderate infections require parenteral therapy, at least initially (C-III). Highly bioavailable oral antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections, including some cases of osteomyelitis (A-II). Topical therapy may be used for some mild superficial infections (B-I). Continue antibiotic therapy until there is evidence that the infection has resolved but not necessarily until a wound has healed. Suggestions for the duration of antibiotic therapy are as follows: for mild infections, 1-2 weeks usually suffices, but some require an additional 1-2 weeks; for moderate and severe infections, usually 2-4 weeks is sufficient, depending on the structures involved, the adequacy of debridement, the type of soft-tissue wound cover, and wound vascularity (A-II); and for osteomyelitis, generally at least 4-6 weeks is required, but a shorter duration is sufficient if the entire infected bone is removed, and probably a longer duration is needed if infected bone remains (B-II). If an infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to >=1 antibiotic courses, consider discontinuing an antimicrobials and, after a few days, obtaining optimal culture specimens (C-III). Seek surgical consultation and, when needed, intervention for infections accompanied by a deep abscess, extensive bone or joint involvement, crepitus, substantial necrosis or gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis (A-II). Evaluating the limb's arterial supply and revascularizing when indicated are particularly important. Surgeons with experience and interest in the field should be recruited by the foot-care team, if possible. Providing optimal wound care, in addition to appropriate antibiotic treatment of the infection, is crucial for healing (A-I). This includes proper wound cleansing, debridement of any callus and necrotic tissue, and, especially, off-loading of pressure. There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific wound dressing or any type of wound healing agents or products for infected foot wounds.

N2  - Objectives. It is widely accepted that peripheral nerve repairs performed within 6 weeks of injury have much better outcomes than those performed at later dates. However, there is no diagnostic technique that can determine if a traumatic peripheral nerve injury requires surgical intervention in the early postinjury phase. The objective of this article was to determine whether novel, noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging techniques could demonstrate the microstructure of human peripheral nerves that is necessary for determining prognosis and determining if surgery is indicated following traumatic injury. Methods. Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging protocols were developed on a 9.4-T research scanner using spin-echo proton density and gradient-echo imaging sequences and a specially designed, inductively coupled radio frequency coil. These imaging protocols were applied to in situ imaging of the human median nerve in 4 fresh-frozen cadaver arms. Results. Noninvasive high-resolution images of the human median nerve were obtained. Structures in the nerve that were observed included fascicles, interfascicular epineurium, perineurium, and intrafascicular septations. Conclusion. Application of these imaging techniques to clinical scanners could provide physicians with a tool that is capable of grading the severity of nerve injuries and providing indications for surgery in the early postinjury phase.

N2  - High-resolution MR imaging of peripheral nerves and nerve plexuses is an area of rapidly growing clinical interest and importance. The number of studies performed is rapidly increasing in response to the need for more detailed in vivo information about neuropathic changes and regional neural anatomy before treatment planning by peripheral nerve specialists [84]. Specific information gained from peripheral nerve-imaging studies is being used to determine the need for biopsy or surgical treatment. In patients who have small tumors, peripheral nerve imaging has proved useful in planning the surgical approach and in predicting the prognosis for preservation of nerve function postoperatively. In cases of traumatic nerve injury, MR imaging results are being considered as part of the clinical assessment regarding (1) the likelihood of spontaneous recovery versus the need for surgical repair and (2) the progression of nerve recovery postoperatively. Additional applications and new developments for the MR techniques used in peripheral nerve imaging are on the horizon. Among these are improvements in the homogeneity of fat saturation methods and alternative approaches to removing fat signal, such as multipoint Dixon fat-water separation with SSFP or FSE imaging methods. Rapid volumetric data acquisition with high CNR may allow the presentation of the largest peripheral nerves and their branches in a three-dimensional display, analogous to the three-dimensional maximum-intensity projection images of the vasculature available with MR angiography. This presentation will provide the referring physician with a more complete picture of the affected peripheral nerves, facilitating localization and diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Improvements in imaging of peripheral nerves coupled with the availability of MR-guided interventional systems should eventually lead to therapeutic interventions for peripheral neuropathy. Experimental studies using mice already have shown that the introduction of replication-defective viral vectors directly into dorsal root ganglia using microneurosurgical technique leads to long-term expression of reporter genes along the length of the sensory neuron, from its distal portion to the ipsilateral nucleus gracilis and cuneatus [85]. Dorsal root ganglia injection may be superior to other therapeutic approaches, such as intraneural injection into more distal peripheral nerve segments [86]. Targeted expression of foreign genes in the peripheral nervous system has several potentially valuable applications, including gene therapy of neuromuscular diseases, neuroanatomic studies, and the elucidation of mechanisms of axonal flow.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess whether MR imaging can image the neurovascular bundle in patients with fractures of the mandible. In addition, an attempt was made to evaluate whether MR images provide information regarding the continuity of the inferior alveolar nerve before surgery and regarding signal intensity changes after trauma. METHOD(S): We analyzed preoperative MR images of 23 patients with mandibular fractures. Object-oriented sagittal view proton density- and T1-weighted sequences (before and after the administration of contrast agent) were used not only in an attempt to obtain purely qualitative information regarding nerve continuity in the neurovascular bundle (inferior alveolar nerve, artery, vein) but also to perform quantitative region-of-interest measurements of signal intensities at four defined measurement sites. The measurements were compared with those obtained for a patient population with healthy mandibles. RESULT(S): It was possible to interpret MR images in 21 cases. MR imaging findings showed that the neurovascular bundle had been cut in two patients and was intact in the remaining 19 patients. These MR imaging findings were confirmed intraoperatively in all cases. Although we found no significant signal intensity differences between patients with intact nerves and patients with cut nerves, we found significant differences between patients with mandibular fractures and patients with unremarkable mandibles. CONCLUSION(S): It is possible to diagnose the interruption of nerve continuity by using MR imaging. Signal intensity measurements in the neurovascular bundle provide no information regarding nerve continuity.

T1  - Sonography in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome: A critical review of the literature
A1  - Beekman, Roy
A1  - Visser, Leo H. 
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Advances in ultrasound technology have made it possible to gain higher spatial resolution and even depict nerves with excellent visual quality. In this article, the literature concerning sonography in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is critically reviewed. We searched Medline for studies on sonography in the diagnosis of CTS and used the reference lists of the articles found. A total of seven studies on the diagnostic capabilities of sonography was found. There were considerable differences in study design. A reliable diagnosis of CTS could be made sonographically, mainly based on an increase in cross-sectional area of the median nerve at the level of the pisiform or hamate bone. However, most studies could not compare the diagnostic capabilities of sonography to those of electrodiagnostic studies, because the latter was applied as the gold standard. Several other reports on the possible extra value of sonography in CTS are considered. It is probable that sonography will not replace electrodiagnostic studies, but may serve as an additional investigation. To gain further insight into the possible additional value of sonography, it is necessary to examine subcategories of CTS patients in which electrodiagnostic studies are equivocal.

N2  - Objective: Diabetes mellitus has a high incidence in general population and goes by high morbidity by specific micro vascular pathology in the retina, renal glomerul and peripheral nerves. In type 1 DM, intensive therapy can prevent or delay the development of long-term complications associated with DM but hypoglycaemia especially severe hypoglycaemia defined, as a low blood glucose resulting in stupor, seizure, or unconsciousness that precludes self-treatment is a serious threat. Hypoglycaemia that may preferentially harm neurons in the medial temporal region, specifically the hippocampus, is a potential danger for the brain cognitive function which several studies failed to detect any significant effects, whereas others indicated an influence on it. A young diabetic case presented here with severe cognitive defect. Great number of severe hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic attacks and convulsion episodes were described in his medical history. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): Neuroradiologic findings on CT and MRI, pointed that global cerebral atrophy that is incompatible with his age. Brain perfusion studies (SPECT, 99mTc-labeled HMPAO) also showed that there were severe perfusion defects at superior temporal region and less perfusion defects at gyrus cingulim in frontal region. These regions are related with memory processing. Severe cognitive defect in this patient seems to be closely related these changes and no another reason was found to explain except the repeated severe hypoglycaemic episodes.

N2  - X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy caused by mutations in the connexin 32 (Cx32) gene. Cx32 is widely expressed in brain and peripheral nerve, yet clinical manifestations of CMTX mainly arise from peripheral neuropathy. We have evaluated two male patients with CMTX who on separate occasions developed transient ataxia, dysarthria, and weakness within 3 days of returning from ski trips at altitudes above 8,000 feet. Magnetic resonance imaging studies in both patients showed nonenhancing, confluent, and symmetrical white matter abnormalities that were more pronounced posteriorly and that resolved over fseveral months. Magnetic transfer images in one patient demonstrated increased magnetization transfer ratios distinct from that seen in demyelination or edema. Both patients returned to their normal baseline within 2 to 3 weeks. These cases suggest that CMTX patients are at risk for developing an acute, transient, neurological syndrome when they travel to places at high altitudes and return to sea level. Cx32 mutations may cause central nervous system dysfunction by reducing the number of functioning gap junctions between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, making both cells more susceptible to abnormalities of intercellular exchange of ions and small molecules in situations of metabolic stress.

N2  - Alpha-mannosidosis is a disease caused by the deficient activity of alpha-mannosidase, a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the degradation of glycoproteins. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides within lysosomes. The purpose of this study was to characterize the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) myelin abnormalities in cats from a breeding colony with a uniform mutation in the gene encoding alpha-mannosidase. Three affected cats and 3 normal cats from 2 litters were examined weekly from 4 to 18 wk of age. Progressively worsening neurological signs developed in affected cats that included tremors, loss of balance and nystagmus. In the PNS, affected cats showed slow motor nerve conduction velocity and increased F-wave latency. Single nerve fiber teasing revealed significant demyelination/remyelination in affected cats. Mean G-ratios of nerves showed a significant increase in affected cats compared to normal cats. Magnetic resonance imaging of the CNS revealed diffuse white matter signal abnormalities throughout the brain of affected cats. Quantitative magnetization transfer imaging showed a 8%-16% decrease in the magnetization transfer ratio in brain white matter of affected cats compared to normal cats, consistent with myelin abnormalities. Histology confirmed myelin loss throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. Thus, histology, electrodiagnostic testing, and magnetic resonance imaging identified significant myelination abnormalities in both the PNS and CNS that have not been described previously in alpha-mannosidosis.

N2  - Magnetic resonance techniques have become increasingly important in neurology for defining: 1 brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerve or muscle structure; 2 pathological changes in tissue structures and properties; and 3 dynamic patterns of functional activation of the brain. New applications have been driven in part by advances in hardware, particularly improvements in magnet and gradient coil design. New imaging strategies allow novel approaches to contrast with, for example, diffusion imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, perfusion imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging. In parallel with developments in hardware and image acquisition have been new approaches to image analysis. These have allowed quantitative descriptions of the image changes to be used for a precise, non-invasive definition of pathology. With the increasing capabilities and specificity of magnetic resonance techniques it is becoming more important that the neurologist is intimately involved in both the selection of magnetic resonance studies for patients and their interpretation. There is a need for considerably improved access to magnetic resonance technology, particularly in the acute or intensive care ward and in the neurosurgical theatre. This report illustrates several key developments. The task force concludes that magnetic resonance imaging is a major clinical tool of growing significance and offers recommendations for maximizing the potential future for magnetic resonance techniques in neurology.

N2  - A 7-year-old female presented with fever, urinary incontinence, mental regression, gait disturbance, and lethargy after diarrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal T2-weighted hypersignal lesions supportive of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Her mother had been diagnosed with hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsy. The girl was also determined to have hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy, with a 1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2 encompassing the gene for peripheral myelin protein 22 detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Hereditary peripheral neuropathies may be a factor in triggering the autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

N2  - Objective. To analyze peripheral nerves with ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR) in leprosy and assess the role of imaging in leprosy patients. Design and patients. Fifty-eight nerves with abnormal clinical features or electromyograms were examined in 23 leprosy patients by means of gray-scale US, Doppler US and MR imaging. Image analysis included: measurement of nerve cross-sectional area; assessment of nerve structure and MR signal intensities; identification of nerve compression within osteofibrous tunnels; detection of endoneural color flow signals and Gd-DTPA enhancement. Correlations were made with clinical findings and a control group of 20 subjects. Fourteen nerves in active reversal reaction were followed up after therapy. Results. Leprosy nerves were classified into three groups based on imaging appearance: group I consisted of 17 normal-appearing nerves; group II, of 30 enlarged nerves with fascicular abnormalities; group III, of 11 nerves with absent fascicular structure. Group II nerves were from patients subjected to reversal reactions; 75% of patients with group III nerves had a history of erythema nodosum leprosum. Nerve compression in osteofibrous tunnels was identified in 33% of group II and 18% of group III nerves. Doppler US and MR imaging were 74% and 92% sensitive in identifying active reactions, based on detection of endoneural color flow signals, long T2 and Gd enhancement. In 64% of cases, follow-up studies showed decreased color flow and Gd uptake after steroids and decompressive surgery. Conclusions. US and MR imaging are able to detect nerves abnormalities in leprosy. Active reversal reactions are indicated by endoneural color flow signals as well as by an increased T2 signal and Gd enhancement. These signs would suggest rapid progression of nerve damage and a poor prognosis unless antireactional treatment is started.

N2  - Background: The frequency of the association between chronic demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) and central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating lesions is probably underestimated. Objective(s): To investigate the occurrence of combined central and peripheral demyelination in CIDP patients and to correlate visual evoked potential (VEP) abnormalities with CNS demyelinating lesions, observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and antibodies against glycolipids. Method(s): Nerve conduction studies, brain MRI and antibodies against glycolipids were prospectively studied in 17 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria proposed for CIDP (Cornblath DR, Asbury AK, Albers JW, Feasby TE, Hahn AF, McLeod JG, Mendell JR, Parry GJ, Pollard JD, Thomas PK. Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task Force. Research criteria for diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Neurology, 1991;41:617-618). VEPs were performed in each case before and after 6 months treatment with either intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or steroids. Result(s): Eight patients (47%) had increased latencies in at least one eye or showed increased interocular latency difference. Four patients (23%) presented a significant high signal intensity on T2-weighted brain MRI images. Of these 4 patients, 3 had prolonged VEP latency. Two patients with delayed VEP latency had antibodies against GM1, and SGLPG and anti-sulfatides, respectively. One patient with normal VEPs also had antibodies to GM1. VEP results were not significantly modified after treatment, either with steroids or IVIG. Conclusion(s): This study confirmed the high frequency of abnormal VEPs in CIDP patients, and found that they are poorly correlated with CNS demyelinating lesions and antibodies against glycolipids. The VEP abnormalities of these patients may be explained by the susceptibility to immune-mediated damage of both the peripheral nervous system and the optic nerve.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - We report here a study of longitudinal relaxation (T1) and magnetisation transfer (MT) in peripheral nerve. Amphibian sciatic nerve was maintained in vitro and studied at a magnetic field strength of 3 T. A CPMG pulse sequence was modified to include either a saturation pulse to measure T1 relaxation or an off-resonance RF irradiation pulse to measure MT. The resulting transverse relaxation (T2) spectra yielded four components corresponding to three nerve compartments, taken to result from myelinic, axonal, and inter-axonal water, and a fourth corresponding to the buffer solution water in which the nerve sample was bathed. Each nerve component was analysed for T1 relaxation and MT. All three nerve T2 components exhibited unique T1 relaxation and MT characteristics, providing further support for the assignment of the components to unique physical compartments of water. Numerical investigation of T(1sat) measurements of each of the three nerve T2 components indicates that while the two shorter-lived exhibit similar steady-state magnetisation transfer ratios (MTRs), their respective MT properties are quite different. Simulations demonstrate that mobile water exchange between these two components is not necessary to explain their similar steady-state MTR. In the context of the assignment of these two components to signal from myelinic and axonal water, this is to say that these two microanatomical regions of nerve may exhibit similar steady-state MTR characteristics despite possessing widely different MT exchange rates. Therefore, interpreting changes in MTR solely to reflect a change in degree of myelination could lead to erroneous conclusions.

N2  - Background and Objectives. Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) is a technique that is worthwhile for anesthesiologists because it allows spinal cord and plexus anatomy to be visualized three dimensionally and followed over time in the same animal. For example, the long-term effect of indwelling intrathecal or plexus catheters can be studied in situ, and convective and diffusive forces within intrathecal, epidural, or nerve sheath spaces can be investigated. Further, diffusion-weighted MRM, which measures an 'apparent diffusion coefficient' (ADC), can be used to track the presence of ischemia, hypoperfusion, or cytotoxic edema. This study investigates problems associated with the use of in vivo MRM for spinal cord and peripheral nerve studies in the rat. Methods. Twenty-one anesthetized female Fisher CDF rats were used. Group 1 (n = 7) was used for anatomic three-dimensional studies. Groups 2 (n = 4), 3 (n = 4), and 4 (n = 6) were used for measurements of the ADC. Group 2 served as controls, group 3 received lumbar intrathecal catheters, and group 4 received cervical intrathecal catheters. Results. Cervical spine, lumbar spine, and spinal nerves and ganglia were accurately visualized with MRM. As a rule, spinal cord gray and white matter were better demonstrated using diffusion-weighted proton stains. By contrast, T2-weighted proton staining superiorly demonstrated structures surrounding the spinal cord. In groups 3 and 4, indwelling intrathecal catheters did not affect the spinal cord ADC, indicating normal blood flow and no cytotoxic edema. Contrast studies revealed nonhomogeneous distribution of contrast predominately in the lateral and ventral intrathecal space. Conclusions. Three-dimensional diffusion-weighted MRM displays cervical and lumbar spine anatomy accurately in vivo. Apparent diffusion coefficients measurements are feasible in rat cervical spinal cord with intrathecal catheters. Spinal cord ADCs are unaffected by intrathecal catheters, indicating normal spinal cord perfusion.

N2  - This report details previously undescribed sonographic findings in the anterior interosseous nerve syndrome. Loss of muscle bulk, increased reflectivity, reduced perfusion on Doppler sonography, and lack of active contraction of the affected muscles were observed. These findings can aid in the localization of the pathologic process and in the exclusion of tendon rupture. Dynamic observation of muscle function and Doppler changes after exercise can also help identify the muscles involved. Both sonography and MRI may be useful in the evaluation of patients with the anterior interosseous nerve syndrome and other peripheral neuropathies.

T1  - Uniform fat suppression in hands and feet through the use of two-point Dixon chemical shift MR imaging
A1  - Maas, Mario

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the potential of two-point Dixon chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging to achieve uniform fat suppression in the distal parts of the extremities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-point Dixon chemical shift imaging was performed in 31 consecutive patients clinically suspected to have bone marrow disease. In some patients, Dixon studies were performed before and after the intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, and in some patients follow-up examinations were performed, for a total of 64 studies. Areas of interest were the hand, wrist, foot, ankle, and lower leg. There was a special interest in the neuropathic foot and osteomyelitis. The uniformity of fat suppression in the entire field of view, the frequency of displacement artifacts, and the applicability of the technique in routine patient treatment were evaluated. RESULT(S): In 64 (100%) Dixon studies, uniform fat suppression was achieved. In 59 (92%) studies, there were no displacement artifacts. In five (8%) studies, displacement artifacts occurred; however, in only one (2%) study did they severely hamper the reading. Thus, in 63 (98%) studies, adequate diagnostic quality was obtained. CONCLUSION(S): Two-point Dixon chemical shift imaging is a good technique for achieving uniform fat suppression in the distal parts of the extremities. Because the frequency of displacement artifacts is low, the technique is applicable in a routine clinical setting.

T1  - Carpal tunnel syndrome: Staging of median nerve compression by MR imaging
A1  - Kleindienst, Andrea

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the potential of MR imaging to depict morphologic alterations of the median nerve correlating with the stage of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Eighteen wrists of normal subjects and 81 wrists of patients with CTS were examined. MR imaging was performed with proton-density- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences. Staging of CTS was done on the basis of clinical and electrophysiological testing, including evaluation of the number of previous steroid infiltrations in conservative treatment. Median nerve flattening, cross-sectional area, and signal intensity were measured from the distal radius to the end of the carpal tunnel. Delineation and structure of the median nerve were recorded qualitatively by two experienced radiologists in consensus. Three major MR imaging criteria of early CTS were (a) isolated prestenotic and intracarpal swelling of the median nerve (P < .01), (b) the absence of significant flattening, and (c) a generalized increase in signal intensity retrograde to the distal radius (P < .01). The nerve showed sharply delineated contours and a homogeneous signal pattern. Advanced CTS was characterized by retrograde swelling of the median nerve to the distal radius (P < .01) and decreased signal intensity (P < .05). Demarcation of the nerve became poorer, and its signal pattern appeared fasciculated. After steroid infiltration, the median nerve was difficult to delineate, showed an inhomogeneous structure, and swelling was less pronounced than without steroid infiltration (P < .05). MR imaging yields typical morphologic findings that correlate with the duration and severity of median nerve compression. Hence, MR imaging allows staging of median nerve compression in CTS and thus may contribute to therapeutic decision-making.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Clinically symptomatic carpal tunnel syndrome is not necessarily accompanied by impaired nerve conduction values. Surgical decompression, however, may immediately lead to complete and lasting relief of symptoms in these patients. Because minimally invasive techniques have reduced perioperative morbidity and vocational impairment related to operative decompression, the decision to decompress symptomatic patients (despite still unimpaired nerve conduction values) might be subject to discussion in the future. New diagnostic tools may be helpful in deciding which therapeutical options to choose. When the wrist is held either in flexion or in extension, the carpal tunnel pressure increases. To investigate the dynamic changes of the carpal tunnel shape during wrist motion, as well as the variations of space for the median nerve and its signal intensity in T2-weighting, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on patients and healthy volunteers alike. Restitution and the persistence of pathological findings were assessed pre- and postoperatively. METHOD(S): MRI (1.0 T) was performed on 20 wrists of patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and pathological nerve conduction values. Healthy volunteers (20 wrists) were matched according to sex and age. MRI was performed in neutral, 45-degree extension, and 45-degree wrist flexion positions. T2- weighted signal intensity of the median nerve was measured in 18 patients pre- and postoperatively. RESULT(S): The cross-sectional area of the carpal tunnel in patients with CTS tends to be smaller than that found in nonsymptomatic volunteers. The cross-sectional area of the carpal tunnel decreases during wrist flexion at the pisiform and hamate level. During wrist extension, the cross-sectional area of the carpal tunnel decreases at the level of the pisiform. During extension, it increases at the level of the hamate. The cross-sectional area of the median nerve showed an increase at the pisiform level (P < 0.05), a flattening of the median nerve at the hamate hook level (P < 0.05), and palmar deviation of the flexor retinaculum at the pisiform and hamate hook level (P < 0.001). This was significantly greater in CTS patients than in individuals with normal wrists. Postoperatively, the distal flattening of the median nerve recovered in 94% of the cases reviewed. Although the signal intensity of the median nerve on T2-weighted images decreased by 67%, the motor latency recovered in only 39% of the cases. CONCLUSION(S): The carpal tunnel was smaller in CTS patients than in healthy volunteers. During flexion and extension, the space available for the median nerve narrows. This may lead to potential median nerve compression. MRI is accurate and reliable for diagnosis and postoperative follow-up of carpal tunnel syndrome. In cases with obvious clinical symptoms and yet not measurably impaired median nerve conduction values, it may be helpful in making a decision for surgical decompression.

N2  - WE UNDERTOOK A prospective study of 43 wrists in 32 patients who had been clinically diagnosed as having carpal tunnel syndrome (study group) and 5 wrists in people who had no symptoms (control group), correlating the clinical, electrodiagnostic, intraoperative, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. MRI of the carpal tunnel and thenar eminence was performed, using coronal and axial T1- and T2-weighted, proton density, and short tau inversion recovery sequences. Abnormalities of the median nerve, as revealed by MRI, were found in 43 of 43 (100%) wrists in the study group and in 0 of 5 (0%) wrists in the control group. Increased signal of the median nerve was seen in 41 of 43 (95%) wrists, increased signal of the flexor tendon sheath in 41 of 43 (95%), volar bowing of the flexor retinaculum in 39 of 43 (91%), increased distance between the flexor tendons in 37 of 43 (86%), and abnormal nerve configuration in 28 of 43 (65%). Increased short tau inversion recovery signal of the thenar muscles was found in 5 of 43 (12%) wrists, all of which had undergone severe denervation changes, as revealed by electromyography. Operative release was performed for 27 of 43 (63%) wrists, and follow-up was obtained for 42 of 43 (98%). A good or excellent postoperative outcome resulted for 20 of 27 (74%) patients, a fair outcome for 2 of 27 (7%), and a poor outcome for 4 of 27 (15%), and 1 of 27 (4%) patients was lost to follow- up. For patients undergoing carpal tunnel release whose MRI revealed an abnormal nerve configuration, the outcome was improved, with good or excellent results in 15 of 18 (83%) patients. No association with outcome was seen with median nerve or flexor tendon signal changes, increased interspace between the flexor tendons, or flexor retinaculum bowing. Our results indicate that MRI is a sensitive diagnostic modality that can demonstrate signal and configurational abnormalities of the median nerve in patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Increased signal of the thenar muscles, as revealed by MRI, using short tau inversion recovery sequences, occurs only in muscles that have undergone severe denervation changes, as revealed by electromyography.

N2  - We have made cross-sectional image 'neurograms' in which peripheral nerve has a greater signal intensity than that of other tissue. Neurographic images of the rabbit forelimb were obtained using a spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that combines fat suppression and diffusion weighting. After fat suppression the nerve shows up in relative isolation and is brighter than the surrounding tissue due to its longer T2 relaxation time of 50 ms compared to 27 ms for muscle. The addition of pulsed gradients for diffusion weighting of the MR signal further enhances the intensity of the nerve signal relative to that of surrounding muscle tissue. The greater diffusional anisotropy of nerve tissue(D(II)/D(I)=3.1) compared to that of muscle (D(II)/D(I)= 1.9) allows further enhancement of the nerve by a subtraction of two diffusion-weighted images, one with the gradients oriented parallel and one with the gradients oriented perpendicular to the nerve orientation. We show that by manipulation of the MRI parameters, either echo time or pulsed gradient strength, the nerves can be made to show up as the most intense feature. This verifies the feasibility of generating three-dimensional 'neurographic' images, analogous to angiograms, but which demonstrate the peripheral nerve tracts in apparent isolation.

N2  - Axonotmesis of the left sciatic nerve was performed on adult male Wistar rats. T1 values of the crushed nerve samples were determined with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Denervation changes of the dependent hind plantar flexor muscles were assessed with proton magnetic resonance imaging of their cross-sectional area and muscle force measurements. However, T1 relaxation time of the crushed nerve samples remained prolonged implying the absence of nerve regeneration. This would be in contradiction with what is known about regeneration after simple crush and the muscle force and magnetic resonance imaging measurements of the dependent plantar flexor muscles. These studies indicated that sufficient nerve regeneration had taken place to restore their muscle force and volume. A model is suggested to explain the persistence of prolonged T1 values in the presence of muscle force recovery.

N2  - THE FORCE AND fatigue of the wrist extensor muscles during maximal voluntary and tetanic contractions were measured and compared in the injured and noninjured extremities of 11 patients with radial nerve gap injury and in 9 normal volunteers. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the wrist extensor muscles was determined by magnetic resonance imaging and was correlated with force. In the patient group, an average of three (range, 2-4) sural nerve cable grafts, measuring 11.5 +/- 5 cm (range, 5-20 cm) in length, were sutured to the nerve stumps at least 9 years before this study. Differences in the CSA values of the injured and noninjured arms were compared, and a ratio was established (CSA(R)). The mean CSA(R) was 82.9% +/- 14.3. These differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.10, paired t-test). Despite very well-recovered muscular mass, the maximal voluntary contraction force was found to be incompletely recovered by up to 62.7% +/- 23, when compared with the noninjured side (P < 0.05, paired t-test). The fraction maximal voluntary contraction force/CSA had decreased by up to 76.4% +/- 25.5 (P < 0.05, paired t-test). An increased fatigability of the affected muscles persisted in all patients. The patients' noninjured extremity behaved in the same way as that of the dominant extremity of normal volunteers with regard to force, lever, and CSA values. In the best-recovered patients, the relation of the maximal voluntary contraction force between the noninjured and the injured side was the same (90% +/- 9.9) as that found between the dominant and the nondominant extremity of normal volunteers (P < 0.05, paired t-test). In more than half of the patients, sural nerve cables provided adequate reinnervation of the wrist extensor muscles to enable them to recover and even to exceed the bottom 5% contraction force (139 N) reported by other authors for the normal male population. Several anatomical features of the radial nerve, however, also participated in a favorable outcome of the motor function after autografting of this nerve.

T1  - Spinal cord tumors: Gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - To assess the utility of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) and of MR imaging in the evaluation of spinal cord tumors, ten consecutive patients were prospectively evaluated. T1-proton density-, and T2-weighted images were obtained in sagittal or axial planes. T1-weighted images were obtained before and after intravenous administration. Five tumors were within the cervical spinal cord; 3 neoplasms were within the thoracic cord; 1 neoplasm extended from the cervical to the thoracic cord and 1 neoplasm extended from the cervical cord to the conus medullaris. Four tumors were ependymomas; 3 were astrocytomas; 1 was an hemangioblastoma, and 1 was a metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The remaining patient died prior to spinal surgery and no autopsy was obtained. Of the precontrast sequences, tumors were best evaluated using T1-weighted images. Abnormal findings included cord widening, presence of a tumor mass, intratumoral or other associated cyst(s), and hemorrhage. Nevertheless, T1-weighted images obtained following the administration of GD were superior relative to all other pre- and post-contrast sequences for defining tumor margins, characterizing cyst(s) and delineating tumor masses. Based primarily on their appearance on post-contrast T1-weighted images, tumor-associated cysts could be subcategorized into 3 types: intratumoral cysts (found within the contrast-enhancing soft tissue mass); nonenhancing extratumoral cysts (found either rostral or caudal to the enhancing tumor mass); and enhancing extratumoral cysts (having an enhancing wall or containing an enhancing nodule). Our results indicate that T1-weighted MR images obtained both before and after administration of Gd are sufficient for characterizing the varying components of intramedullary spinal cord tumors. This information assists in treatment planning and follow-up of patients with these tumors.

N2  - Seventeen benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors were studied using MR. In all cases T2 relaxation time, signal intensity on T1-weighted images (lesion/muscle ratio), detectability of nerve of origin, nerve-lesion relationship, and presence of a capsule were assessed. Sixteen tumors showed marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted images with T2 relaxation times values >95 ms. One schwannoma was almost isointense with fat (T2 60 ms). All lesions were isointense with muscle on T1-weighted images. In schwannomas the nerve was usually situated at the periphery of the lesion and only in one case was it obliterated by the mass. In neurofibromas the nerve was either visible in a central position within the mass (two cases) or no longer visible (five cases). A capsule could be detected in 70% of the schwannomas and in 30% of the neurofibromas. In patients with soft tissue masses, MR may contribute to recognition of nerve sheath tumors by showing the nerve of origin and typical signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. It can also be helpful in distinguishing between schwannomas and neurofibromas by the location of the nerve of origin and the presence of a capsule.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate 22 histologically proven peripheral nerve sheath tumors, approximately two-thirds of which arose in the lower extremity. The histologic distribution was as follows: 12 schwannomas, 7 neurofibromas, and 3 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (2 of which occurred in patients with neurofibromatosis). Most lesions demonstrated an intermediate to moderately bright signal on T1-weighted images and were minimally inhomogeneous. All lesions were moderately bright on proton-density-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images, again with variable inhomogeneity. The extent of the tumor was best assessed on proton-density- and T2-weighted images. Smooth margins were noted in 19 lesions. Of the 3 remaining lesions, 2 were malignant (but had been subjected to biopsy prior to MRI), and the other lesion was a plexiform neurofibroma. MRI accurately determined the relationship between the lesion and the adjacent neurovascular structures and muscles, thereby assisting surgical management. On MRI, 5 lesions demonstrated coexistent subtle muscle atrophy along the longitudinal axis of surrounding or distally innervated musculature. This latter finding, together with the presence of a tumor in the vicinity of a large nerve trunk, suggests a peripheral nerve sheath neoplasm.

N2  - Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of a case of Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD) using a 1.5 T system is described. The patient showed progressive spastic diplegia with equinovarus deformity of the feet, dystonic postural movements, dysarthria, dysphagia, mental deterioration, optic nerve atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. These clinical features were compatible with HSD. Symmetrical, decreased signal intensity was seen on both proton density weighted and T2-weighted spin echo images in the globus pallidus as well as in the substantia nigra (Group I). This MR finding suggests an increased iron deposition in these subcortical nuclei, which is characteristic of HSD. The characteristic MR imaging, together with the relevant clinical features, was considered to be useful for establishing the diagnosis of HSD.

N2  - We examined two patients with optic nerve evulsion as well as nasal peripapillary retinal and retinal pigment epithelial evulsion after ocular trauma. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated an intact peripapillary choriocapillaris, loss of peripapillary retina and retinal pigment epithelium, and complete disruption of retinal perfusion. We have postulated a mechanism for traumatic peripapillary retinal evulsion involving severe anterior displacement and abduction of the globe that may explain how the disruptive force was transmitted to the nasal retinal nerve fiber layer. We have provided a clinical correlation with magnetic resonance imaging of the optic nerve and globe of a normal individual.

N2  - High-field strength (1.5 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging in 15 patients with multiple and extensive white-matter lesions and clinically definite multiple sclerosis delineated a previously undescribed finding of abnormally decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the thalamus and putamen. The decreased signal intensity (preferential decreased T2 relaxation time) is most likely to be related to abnormally increased iron accumulation causing local magnetic field heterogeneities.

N2  - We examined the hypothesis that the polyol accumulation resulting from chronic galactose supplementation in the diet produces endoneurial edema that can be prevented by inhibition of aldose reductase. We explored the potential of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to quantitate and characterize the water accumulation in the sciatic nerve in this "galactose neuropathy." The data demonstrate a 16% increase in gravimetrically determined total water content of nerve in the galactose-fed rat after 8 mo of this diet and a 50% increase in the T1 relaxation time for nerve water as determined by NMR spectroscopy. Prolongation of the T1 relaxation time reflects increased rotation of water in a magnetic field, consistent with an extracellular site of the additional water. Simultaneous feeding of sorbinil to inhibit aldose reductase resulted in normalization of both total nerve water and of the prolongation of T1 relaxation time. These data define the NMR-spectroscopic state of endoneurial edema in the galactose-fed rat and suggest specific application to the investigation of the role of aldose reductase in human diabetic neuropathy.

Y1  - 1987//
N2  - A field mapping technique was used to detect changes in the local magnetic field in 14 tumors, five hematomas, one lacunar infarct, and two cases of multiple sclerosis. These changes were attributed to variations in the tissue susceptibility. A partial or complete rim of changed susceptibility was detected at the margin of five of the tumors and localized changes were seen within two of the tumors. All five hematomas displayed susceptibility effects. These were seen at the rim of the hematoma in all cases but central effects were also seen in four cases. Our area of probable lacunar infarction also displayed susceptibility effects. The effects described may be due to the paramagnetic contribution of species such as deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, free ferric iron, hemosiderin, and other breakdown products of blood. Local field inhomogeneities due to changes in tissue susceptibility have implications for magnetic resonance (MR) image interpretation and the performance of MR spectroscopy.

T1  - T2 estimates in healthy and diseased brain tissue: A comparison using various MR pulse sequences

A1  - Riederer, S.J. 
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Fourteen patients and five healthy individuals underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to determine an effective multiple spin echo pulse sequence for estimating T2. Lesions examined included infarction, glioma, multiple sclerosis, and acute hematoma. A pulse repetition time (TR) of 1,500 msec and echo delays (TEs) of 25, 50, 75, and 100 msec were used. Computed T2 images were derived from all four echoes, the first two echoes, and the first and fourth echoes. T2 values were obtained from specific brain locales using region-of-interest analysis. Use of either the first two echoes or the first and fourth in the T2 fit provided T2 estimates which closely correlated with that of the four-echo analysis. The noise level in T2 maps constructed from the 25- and 100-msec echoes was modestly (typically 10%) higher than that from four echoes; noise level from the 25- and 50-msec echoes was markedly higher, typically 60%. This behavior is remarkably consistent with that predicted from theory. All 19 subjects displayed consistent relative T2 values for specific brain structures; in 13, the absolute T2 values fell within a limited range. Despite the high sensitivity of T2 images, their specificity in the detection of most brain disease appears limited except in acute intra-cerebral hematoma, which exhibited a decreased T2 relaxation time using high-field-strength MR imaging.

A1  - Grossman, R.I.

A1  - Atlas, S.W. 
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Magnetic resonance (MR) images - both nonenhanced and enhanced with gadolinium DTPA/dimeglumine (Gd) - were compared with high-iodine (88.1 g I) computed tomographic (HICT) scans in demonstrating lesions in 15 patients known to have multiple sclerosis (MS). T1-weighted, mixed (T1, proton density, and T2), and T2-weighted MR pulse sequences were used. More than 20 lesions in each of 14 patients were demonstrated by pre-Gd mixed images and T2WI. Nine patients had clinical symptoms of active disease. Gd-enhanced T1WI showed at least one lesion that appeared to correspond with newly reported symptoms or signs. In addition, three clinically stable patients showed enhancement. Enhancement was best seen on 3-minute T1WI. HICT scans showed enhancement in four of the nine patients with active disease and in none of five clinically stable patients. Gd-enhanced MR imaging appears to be more sensitive than HICT in the detection of the transient abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier that occur in patients with active MS and appears capable of distinguishing active lesions that may correspond to the anatomic regions responsible for abnormal clinical findings.

T1  - The mystery of the origin of multiple sclerosis
A1  - McDonald, W.I. 
Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Our present understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis is discussed in relation to the views of Sir William Gowers. He perceived that both environmental and genetic factors might be implicated in the aetiology of the disease. Evidence for the former was first reported in 1903, but has become convincing only in the past 20 years; the nature of the environmental factor remains obscure. Evidence for a genetic influence on susceptibility has accumulated since the 1930s, the most compelling coming from the recent Canadian twin study. The number and mode of operation of the genetic factors is still uncertain, but there is eivdence for the implication of genetically controlled cellular immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of the disease. The precise relationship between transient changes in immunological status and the development of new lesions has yet to be defined; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) promises to play a significant role in this analysis because of its sensitivity in detecting abnormalities in multiple sclerosis. MRI is not in itself specific; it is probable that the similar appearances in multiple sclerosis and cerebral vascular disease both derive at least in part from the influence of astrocytic gliosis on proton content and distribution. The significance of the gliosis is uncertain. Gowers believed that the primary defect in multiple sclerosis lay in the astrocyte. Recent observations on the immunological functions of this cell in vitro suggest that it could be involved early in the pathogenesis of the lesion.

Y1  - 1983//
N2  - An in vitro study of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) response of protons in normal and pathological human skeletal muscle is presented. Muscle biopsies from 34 patients with various neuromuscular diseases and 5 normal subjects were studied by proton NMR techniques and the results were compared with those of light and electron microscopy. Proton spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and recovery law for the nulear magnetization have been determined at 37degreeC and 43.5 MHz. The T1s for normal tissues were in the 650 to 800 ms range and the recovery process was nearly exponential. Muscles with well defined neuromuscular diseases were associated with highly nonexponential relaxation processes. The relationship between morphological alterations of the muscle tissues and the proton NMR response may become the basis of a fast and simple method for the diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases.
