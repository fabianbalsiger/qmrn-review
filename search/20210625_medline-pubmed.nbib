AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the diagnostic performance of qualitative and 
      (semi-)quantitative MRI and ultrasound for distinguishing chronic inflammatory 
      demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) from 
      segmental spinal muscular atrophy (sSMA). METHODS: Patients with CIDP (n = 13), MMN 
      (n = 10), or sSMA (n = 12) and healthy volunteers (n = 30) were included. MRI of the 
      brachial plexus, using short tau inversion recovery (STIR), nerve-specific 
      T2-weighted (magnetic resonance neurography [MRN]), and diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) sequences, was evaluated. Furthermore, with ultrasound, cross-sectional areas 
      of the nerves were evaluated. Three radiologists blinded for diagnosis qualitatively 
      scored hypertrophy and increased signal intensity (STIR and MRN), and intraobserver 
      and interobserver agreement was assessed. For the (semi-)quantitative modalities, 
      group differences and receiver operator characteristics were calculated. RESULTS: 
      Hypertrophy and increased signal intensity were found in all groups including 
      healthy controls. Intraobserver and interobserver agreements varied considerably 
      (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.00-0.811 and 0.101-0.491, respectively). DTI 
      showed significant differences (p < 0.05) among CIDP, MMN, sSMA, and controls for 
      fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in the brachial 
      plexus. Ultrasound showed significant differences in cross-sectional area (p < 0.05) 
      among CIDP, MMN, and sSMA in upper arm and brachial plexus. For distinguishing 
      immune-mediated neuropathies (CIDP and MMN) from sSMA, ultrasound yielded the 
      highest area under the curve (0.870). CONCLUSION: Qualitative assessment of 
      hypertrophy and signal hyperintensity on STIR or MRN is of limited value. DTI 
      measures may discriminate among CIDP, MMN, and sSMA. Currently, ultrasound may be 
      the most appropriate diagnostic imaging aid in the clinical setting.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) also known as Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is a 
      hereditary neurodegenerative disease associated with severe clinical manifestations 
      and premature death. Although rare, it is the most common autosomal dominant 
      spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide and has a distinct geographic distribution, 
      reaching peak prevalence in certain regions of Brazil, Portugal and China. Due to 
      its clinical heterogeneity, it was initially described as several different entities 
      and as had many designations over the last decades. An accurate diagnosis become 
      possible in 1994, after the identification of the MJD1 gene. Among its wide clinical 
      spectrum, progressive cerebellar ataxia is normally present. Other symptoms include 
      pyramidal syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, oculomotor abnormalities, extrapyramidal 
      signs and sleep disorders. On the basis of the presence/absence of important 
      extra-pyramidal signs, and the presence/absence of peripheral signs, five clinical 
      types have been defined. Neuroimaging studies like MRI, DTI and MRS, can be useful 
      as they can characterize structural and functional differences in specific subgroups 
      of patients with MJD. There is no effective treatment for MJD. Symptomatic therapies 
      are used to relieve some of the clinical symptoms and physiotherapy is also helpful 
      in improving quality of live. Several clinical trials have been carried out using 
      different molecules like sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, varenicline and lithium 
      carbonate, but the results of these trials were negative or showed little benefit. 
      Future studies sufficiently powered and adequately designed are warranted.

AB  - Magnetic resonance neurography (also called MRN or MR neurography) refers to MR 
      imaging dedicated to the peripheral nerves. It is a technique that enhances 
      selective multiplanar visualisation of the peripheral nerve and pathology by 
      encompassing a combination of two-dimensional, three-dimensional and diffusion 
      imaging pulse sequences. Referring physicians who seek imaging techniques that can 
      depict and diagnose peripheral nerve pathologies superior to conventional MR imaging 
      are driving the demand for MRN. This article reviews the pathophysiology of 
      peripheral nerves in common practice scenarios, technical considerations of MRN, 
      current indications of MRN, normal and abnormal neuromuscular appearances, and 
      imaging pitfalls. Finally, the emerging utility of diffusion-weighted and diffusion 
      tensor imaging is discussed and future directions are highlighted. KEY POINTS: • 
      Lesion relationship to neural architecture is more conspicuous on MRN than MRI. • 3D 
      multiplanar imaging technique is essential for pre-surgical planning. • Nerve 
      injuries can be classified on MRN using Sunderland's classification. • DTI provides 
      quantitative information and insight into intraneural integrity and pathophysiology.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Single-organ vasculitis of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is 
      often designated nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN). Several variants or 
      subtypes have been distinguished, including migratory sensory neuropathy, 
      postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy, diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies, 
      skin-nerve vasculitides, and, arguably, neuralgic amyotrophy. NSVN often presents as 
      nondiabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (LRPN). This review updates 
      classification, clinical features, epidemiology, and imaging of these disorders. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: A recent study showed the annual incidence of LRPN in Olmstead 
      County, Minnesota to be 4.16/100 000:2.79/100 000 diabetic and 1.27/100 000 
      nondiabetic. This study was the first to determine the incidence or prevalence of 
      any vasculitic neuropathy. In NSVN, ultrasonography shows multifocal enlargement of 
      proximal and distal nerves. In neuralgic amyotrophy, MRI and ultrasound reveal 
      multifocal enlargements and focal constrictions in nerves derived from the brachial 
      plexus. Histopathology of these chronic lesions shows inflammation and rare 
      vasculitis. Diffusion tensor imaging of tibial nerves in NSVN revealed decreased 
      fractional anisotropy in one study. SUMMARY: Single-organ PNS vasculitides are the 
      most common inflammatory neuropathies. Neuralgic amyotrophy might result from PNS 
      vasculitis, but further study is necessary. The usefulness of focal nerve 
      enlargements or constrictions in understanding pathological mechanisms, directing 
      biopsies, and monitoring disease activity in NSVN should be further investigated.

AB  - Background Neurologic complications in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been 
      described, but the understanding of their pathophysiologic causes and 
      neuroanatomical correlates remains limited. Purpose To report on the frequency and 
      type of neuroradiological findings in COVID-19. Materials and Methods In this 
      retrospective study, all consecutive adult hospitalized patients with polymerase 
      chain reaction positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and 
      who underwent neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May 
      24, 2020, were included. All examinations were systematically re-evaluated by 12 
      readers. Summary descriptive statistics were calculated. Results A total of 185 
      patients with COVID-19 (62 years ± 14 [standard deviation]; 138 men) underwent 
      neuroimaging. In total, 222 brain CT, 47 brain MRI, and seven spinal MRI 
      examinations were performed. Intra-axial susceptibility abnormalities were the most 
      common finding (29 of 39; 74%, 95% CI: 58, 87) in patients who underwent brain MRI, 
      often with an ovoid shape suggestive of microvascular pathology and with a 
      predilection for the corpus callosum (23 of 39; 59%; 95% CI: 42, 74) and 
      juxtacortical areas (14 of 39; 36%; 95% CI: 21, 53). Ischemic and macrohemorrhagic 
      manifestations were also observed, but vascular imaging did not demonstrate overt 
      abnormalities. Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 19 patients did not 
      reveal consistent asymmetries between hemispheres or regions. Many patients (18 of 
      41; 44%; 95% CI: 28, 60) had leukoencephalopathy and one patient had a cytotoxic 
      lesion of the corpus callosum. Other findings included olfactory bulb signal 
      abnormalities (seven of 37; 19%), prominent optic nerve subarachnoid spaces (20 of 
      36; 56%), and enhancement of the parenchyma (three of 20; 15%), leptomeninges (three 
      of 20; 15%), cranial nerves (two of 20; 10%), and spinal nerves (two of four; 50%). 
      At MRI follow-up, regression of leukoencephalopathy and progressive leptomeningeal 
      enhancement was observed in one patient each, respectively, which is suggestive of 
      dynamic processes. Conclusion Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 had a wide 
      spectrum of vascular and inflammatory involvement of both the central and peripheral 
      nervous system. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this

AB  - Nerve imaging is an important component in the assessment of patients presenting 
      with suspected peripheral nerve pathology. Although magnetic resonance neurography 
      and ultrasound are the most commonly utilized techniques, several promising new 
      modalities are on the horizon. Nerve imaging is useful in localizing the nerve 
      injury, determining the severity, providing prognostic information, helping 
      establish the diagnosis, and helping guide surgical decision making. The focus of 
      this article is imaging of damaged nerves, focusing on nerve injuries and entrapment 
      neuropathies.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: We examined the chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
      polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) patients and non-CIDP patients who have similar 
      symptoms and difficult to differential diagnosis with CIDP by magnetic resonance 
      neurography to find the difference among them. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 
      differential diagnostic value of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) for CIDP and 
      other peripheral neuropathies. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Thirty-two consecutive 
      patients with CIDP and 22 non-CIDP patients with symptoms similar to CIDP and 
      difficult to be discriminate were recruited and imaged as a control group between 
      May 2017 and May 2019. METHODS: In this prospective study, the brachial plexus and 
      lumbosacral plexus of 32 CIDP patients and 22 non-CIDP patients were examined by 
      MRN. The clinical features and the nerve roots cross-sectional area (CSA) of the 
      brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus were measured. RESULTS: The CSA of nerve 
      roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1 and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, 
      endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes syndrome patients were all shown 
      extensive by MRN. The sensitivity of MRN in diagnosing CIDP was 81.25% (26/32), the 
      specificity was 68.18% (15/22), the positive predictive value was 78.79% (26/33), 
      the negative predictive value was 71.43% (15/21), the accuracy was 75.93% (40/54), 
      the misdiagnosis rate was 24.07% (13/54), and the kappa value was 0.498. Receiver 
      operating characteristic analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for CIDP with 
      the CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.762) and that of 
      the brachial plexus (AUC = 0.762), and the combined of both examinations did not 
      improve the diagnostic efficacy compared with either (AUC = 0.769). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1, and polyneuropathy, 
      organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes syndrome were difficult to 
      distinguish by MRN. Atypical CIDP patients had less nerve root injury compared with 
      typical CIDP patients. MRN of either the brachial plexus or the lumbosacral plexus 
      had a high diagnostic accuracy for CIDP, and it is not necessary to perform both 
      parts of the examination. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.

AB  - Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and related techniques such as 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are uniquely sensitive to the microstructure of the 
      brain and spinal cord. In the acute aftermath of nervous system injury, for example, 
      DWI reveals changes caused by injury that remains invisible on other MRI contrasts 
      such as T(2)-weighted imaging. This ability has led to a demonstrated clinical 
      utility in cerebral ischemia. However, despite strong promise in preclinical models 
      and research settings, DWI has not been as readily adopted for other acute injuries 
      such as traumatic spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the 
      precise biophysical mechanisms that underlie DWI and DTI changes are not fully 
      understood. In this report, we review the DWI and DTI changes that occur in acute 
      neurological injury of cerebral ischemia, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain 
      injury, and peripheral nerve injury. Their associations with the underlying biology 
      are examined with an emphasis on the role of acute axon and dendrite beading. 
      Lastly, emerging DWI techniques to overcome the limitations of DTI are discussed as 
      these may offer the needed improvements to translate to clinical settings.

AB  - Technical advances are rapidly changing the clinical and instrumental approach to 
      peripheral nerve diseases. Magnetic resonance neurography, diffusion tensor imaging 
      and nerve ultrasonography are increasingly entering the diagnostic workup of 
      peripheral neuropathies as tools that complement neurophysiology and enable 
      investigation of proximal structures, such as plexuses and roots. Progress in the 
      design of magnetic resonance scanners and sequences, and the development of 
      high-frequency ultrasound probes mean that high-resolution peripheral nerve imaging 
      is possible, enabling detailed examination of nerve size, morphology and internal 
      fascicular structure that can integrate nerve conduction studies into clinical 
      practice. In the growing field of small-fibre neuropathy, in which traditional nerve 
      conduction studies are of little or no use, skin biopsy has become a reliable tool 
      for diagnosis. Corneal confocal microscopy, nociceptive evoked potentials and 
      microneurography are emerging techniques that are mainly used in clinical research 
      settings, but have increasing relevance to clinical practice. We review these new 
      and emerging techniques and their effects on diagnosis, treatment strategies and 
      prognosis in a variety of peripheral neuropathies, including entrapments, brachial 
      plexopathies, immune and inherited neuropathies, and small-fibre neuropathies. We 
      discuss the most promising research findings and their potential for future 
      application in clinical practice.

AB  - We systematically identified and reviewed 29 studies of peripheral nerve ultrasound 
      or magnetic resonance imaging (MRN) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The 
      majority of the ultrasound studies reported smaller nerves and nerve roots in ALS 
      compared to healthy controls, but there was a large overlap of the cross-sectional 
      nerve area between ALS and controls. Most of the MRN studies confirmed nerve 
      abnormalities demonstrating slight T2 hyperintensities and, sometimes, mild 
      enlargement of more proximal nerve segments (plexus, roots) in ALS. The size of the 
      proximal nerve segments, i.e. nerve roots, is thus somewhat incongruent between 
      nerve ultrasound and MRN in ALS. Peripheral nerve ultrasound has the potential to 
      differentiate between ALS and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) in that patients 
      with MMN have significantly larger nerves. Conversely, there is an overlap of MRN 
      abnormalities in ALS and MMN, restricting the techniques' utility in the clinical 
      setting. A subgroup of patients with ALS seems to reveal a sonographic nerve pattern 
      suggesting peripheral nerve inflammation. In the future, combined imaging with nerve 
      ultrasound and MRN assessing parameters such as blood flow or textural markers may 
      aid in the understanding of the deep nerve microstructure down to the fascicle 
      level, and thus, in the classification of the nerve state as more degenerative or 
      more inflammatory in ALS. This systematic review provides evidence that nerve 
      imaging abnormalities are common in ALS.

LID - 10.1002/jmri.26965 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative diffusion MRI is a promising technique for evaluating 
      peripheral nerve integrity but low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede 
      measurement accuracy. PURPOSE: To evaluate principal component analysis (PCA) and 
      generalized spherical deconvolution (genSD) denoising techniques to improve 
      within-subject reproducibility and peripheral nerve conspicuity. STUDY TYPE: 
      Prospective. SUBJECTS: Seven healthy volunteers and three peripheral neuropathy 
      patients. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T/multiband single-shot echo planar diffusion 
      sequence using multishell 55-direction scheme. ASSESSMENT: Images were processed 
      using four methods: "original" (no denoising), "average" (10 repetitions), 
      "PCA-only," and "PCA + genSD." Tibial and common peroneal nerve segmentations and 
      masks were generated from volunteer diffusion data. Quantitative (SNR and 
      contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) values were calculated. Three radiologists 
      qualitatively evaluated nerve conspicuity for each method. The two denoising methods 
      were also performed in three patients with peripheral neuropathies. STATISTICAL 
      TESTS: For healthy volunteers, calculations included SNR and CNR(FA) (computed using 
      FA values). Coefficient of variation (CV%) of CNR(FA) quantified within-subject 
      reproducibility. Groups were compared with two-sample t-tests (significance P < 
      0.05; two-tailed, Bonferroni-corrected). Odds ratios (ORs) quantified the relative 
      rates of each of three radiologists confidently identifying a nerve, per slice, for 
      the four methods. RESULTS: "PCA + genSD" yielded the highest SNR (mean(overall) = 
      14.83 ± 1.99) and tibial and common peroneal nerve CNR(FA) (mean(tibial) = 3.45, 
      mean(peroneal) = 2.34) compared to "original" (P (SNR) < 0.001; P (CNR) = 0.011) and 
      "PCA-only" (P (SNR) < 0.001, P (CNR) < 0.001). "PCA + genSD" had higher 
      within-subject reproducibility (low CV%) for tibial (6.04 ± 1.98) and common 
      peroneal nerves (8.27 ± 2.75) compared to "original" and "PCA-only." The mean FA was 
      higher for "original" than "average" (P < 0.001), but did not differ significantly 
      between "average" and "PCA + genSD" (P = 0.14). "PCA + genSD" had higher tibial and 
      common peroneal nerve conspicuity than "PCA-only" (OR(tibial) = 2.50, P < 0.001; 
      OR(peroneal) = 1.86, P < 0.001) and "original" (OR(tibial) = 2.73, P < 0.001; 
      OR(peroneal) = 2.43, P < 0.001). DATA CONCLUSION: PCA + genSD denoising method 
      improved SNR, CNR(FA) , and within-subject reproducibility (CV%) without biasing FA 
      and nerve conspicuity. This technique holds promise for facilitating more reliable, 
      unbiased diffusion measurements of peripheral nerves. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Piriformis muscle syndrome (PS) is a disorder encompassing a 
      constellation of symptoms, including buttock and hip pain. In this study we aimed to 
      assess the value of ultrasound (US) in the diagnosis of PS. METHODS: Thirty-three 
      clinically diagnosed PS patients and 26 healthy volunteers underwent a clinical PS 
      scoring examination and US and MRI assessment of the bilateral piriformis muscles. 
      The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of the US 
      parameters (i.e., increased thickness [iTh] and increased cross-sectional area 
      [iCSA]) for piriformis muscle were evaluated. RESULTS: On US and MRI, the thickness 
      and CSA were increased in PS patients. The AUROCs for the iTh and iCSA for 
      discriminating stage 0 (healthy volunteers) from stage 1 through stage 3 (PS 
      patients) were 0.88 and 0.95, respectively. DISCUSSION: US may be a reliable 
      technique for the clinical diagnosis of PS. Muscle Nerve 59:411-416, 2019.

PG  - e653-e664
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000007945 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize and quantify peripheral nerve lesions and muscle 
      degeneration in clinically, genetically, and electrophysiologically well-classified, 
      nonpediatric patients with 5q-linked spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) by 
      high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). METHODS: Thirty-one adult 
      patients with genetically confirmed 5q-linked SMA types II, IIIa, and IIIb and 31 
      age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were prospectively investigated. All 
      patients received neurologic, physiotherapeutic, and electrophysiologic assessments. 
      MRN at 3.0T with anatomic coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh 
      down to the tibiotalar joint was performed with dual-echo 2D relaxometry sequences 
      with spectral fat saturation and a 3D T2-weighted inversion recovery sequence. 
      Detailed quantification of nerve injury by morphometric and microstructural MRN 
      markers and qualitative classification of fatty muscle degeneration were conducted. 
      RESULTS: Established clinical scores and compound muscle action potentials 
      discriminated well between the 3 SMA types. MRN revealed that peroneal and tibial 
      nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) at the thigh and lower leg level as well as spinal 
      nerve CSA were markedly decreased throughout all 3 groups, indicating severe 
      generalized peripheral nerve atrophy. While peroneal and tibial nerve T2 relaxation 
      time was distinctly increased at all analyzed anatomic regions, the proton spin 
      density was clearly decreased. Marked differences in fatty muscle degeneration were 
      found between the 3 groups and for all analyzed compartments. CONCLUSIONS: MRN 
      detects and quantifies peripheral nerve involvement in SMA types II, IIIa, and IIIb 
      with high sensitivity in vivo. Quantitative MRN parameters (T2 relaxation time(,) 
      proton spin density, CSA) might serve as novel imaging biomarkers in SMA to indicate 
      early microstructural nerve tissue changes in response to treatment.

TI  - MRI of the ulnar nerve pre- and post-transposition: imaging features and rater 
      agreement.
PG  - 559-570
LID - 10.1007/s00256-020-03598-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine the rater agreement of MRI features of the ulnar nerve pre- and 
      post-transposition and association with recurrent symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      This IRB-approved retrospective cohort analysis examined 23 subjects who underwent 
      elbow MRI pre- and post-ulnar nerve transposition from 1999 to 2018, 10 of whom 
      developed recurrent symptoms. Pre- and post-transposition MRIs were evaluated by two 
      blinded radiologists for ulnar nerve cross-sectional area, signal intensity, 
      fascicular architecture, caliber change, and perineural scar. Inter-rater agreement 
      was estimated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for continuous 
      variables and Gwet's agreement coefficient (AC) for categorical variables. Binary 
      logistic regression modeling probed associations between imaging markers and symptom 
      recurrence. RESULTS: The ulnar nerve, post-operatively, demonstrated statistically 
      significant increases in size (p < 0.001), signal intensity (p = 0.021), and abrupt 
      caliber change (p = 0.024). None of the imaging features, except for higher signal 
      intensity of the nerve pre-transposition as demonstrated by one rater, were 
      predictive of symptom recurrence. Inter-rater agreement for cross-sectional area 
      measurements of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel was excellent (ICCs of 0.91 
      and 0.83). Substantial-to-excellent inter-rater agreement was observed 
      pre-operatively for nerve signal intensity, caliber change, and fascicular 
      architecture. Post-operatively, agreement on nerve signal intensity and perineural 
      scar was excellent (ACs of 0.90 and 0.88), but only slight for caliber change 
      (0.15). CONCLUSION: Inter-rater agreement for qualitative and quantitative 
      assessment of the ulnar nerve was generally robust. Post-transposition, the ulnar 
      nerve was generally larger and more T2-hyperintense, but MRI features were not 
      predictive of recurrent ulnar neuropathy, except for perhaps the signal intensity of 
      the nerve pre-transposition.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the discriminative power of radiomics of peripheral nerves at 
      1.5T MRI, using common entrapment neuropathies of the upper limb as a model system 
      of focal nerve injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiomics was retrospectively done on 
      peripheral nerve fascicles on T1-weighted 1.5T MRI of 40 patients with diagnosis of 
      mild carpal (n = 25) and cubital tunnel (n = 15) syndrome and of 200 controls. 
      Z-score normalization and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare features of 
      normal and pathological peripheral nerves. Receiver operating characteristic 
      analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of n = 104 radiomics features were computed 
      for each patient and control. Significant differences between normal and 
      pathological median and ulnar nerves were found in n = 23/104 features (p < 0.001). 
      According to features classification, n = 5/23 features were shape-based, n = 7/23 
      were first-order features, n = 11/23 features were classified as gray level run 
      length matrix. Nine of the selected features showed an AUC higher that 0.7: minimum 
      AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.61-0.89) for sum variance and maximum AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 
      0.82-0.99) for zone entropy. CONCLUSION: Features analysis demonstrated 
      statistically significant differences between normal and pathological nerve. The 
      results suggested that radiomics analysis could assess the median and ulnar nerve 
      inner structure changes due to the loss of the fascicular pattern, intraneural 
      edema, fibrosis or fascicular alterations in mild carpal tunnel and mild cubital 
      tunnel syndromes even when the nerve cross-sectional area does not change.

AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to examine the correlation between DTI, clinical assessment, 
      and electromyography results in patients who underwent primary median nerve repair. 
      METHODS: Ten patients who underwent primary repair of the complete median nerve 
      transection were included. Study assessments were performed on both the traumatized 
      and non-traumatized extremities and patients were followed up for a minimum duration 
      of 11 months. Clinical assessments, (Tinnel test, static 2-point discrimination 
      test, motor and quality of life assessments), electromyography and DTI were 
      performed. RESULTS: None of the clinical or electromyographic parameters correlated 
      significantly with any of the diffusion tensor imaging parameters, i.e. fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (p>0.05 for all). In 
      addition, The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores did not 
      correlate with either FA (r=0.55, p=0.098) or ADC (r=0.40, p=0.260) values. However, 
      Tinnel positive cases (n=3) had lower relative FA when compared to Tinnel negative 
      cases (n=7) (-0.11±0.19 vs. 0.05±0.04, p=0.033). CONCLUSION: Our findings do not 
      support the presence of relations between DTI parameters and electromyographic or 
      most of the clinical parameters. Further MRI studies with larger numbers of patients 
      with complete transection of the median nerve using the novel imaging parameters are 
      warranted. KEY WORDS: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Electromyography (EMG), Median 
      nerve, Nerve injury, Nerve repair.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in Cardiac Amyloidosis.
PG  - e009901
LID - 10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.119.009901 [doi]
AB  - Background Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a disease of interstitial myocardial 
      infiltration, usually by light chains or transthyretin. We used diffusion tensor 
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) to noninvasively assess the effects of 
      amyloid infiltration on the cardiac microstructure. Methods DT-CMR was performed at 
      diastole and systole in 20 CA, 11 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 10 control 
      subjects with calculation of mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and sheetlet 
      orientation (secondary eigenvector angle). Results Mean diffusivity was elevated and 
      fractional anisotropy reduced in CA compared with both controls and hypertrophic 
      cardiomyopathy (P<0.001). In CA, mean diffusivity was correlated with extracellular 
      volume (r=0.68, P=0.004), and fractional anisotropy was inversely correlated with 
      circumferential strain (r=-0.65, P=0.02). In CA, diastolic secondary eigenvector 
      angle was elevated, and secondary eigenvector angle mobility was reduced compared 
      with controls (both P<0.001). Diastolic secondary eigenvector angle was correlated 
      with amyloid burden measured by extracellular volume in transthyretin, but not light 
      chain amyloidosis. Conclusions DT-CMR can characterize the microstructural effects 
      of amyloid infiltration and is a contrast-free method to identify the location and 
      extent of the expanded disorganized myocardium. The diffusion biomarkers mean 
      diffusivity and fractional anisotropy effectively discriminate CA from hypertrophic 
      cardiomyopathy. DT-CMR demonstrated that failure of sheetlet relaxation in diastole 
      correlated with extracellular volume in transthyretin, but not light chain 
      amyloidosis. This indicates that different mechanisms may be responsible for 
      impaired contractility in CA, with an amyloid burden effect in transthyretin, but an 
      idiosyncratic effect in light chain amyloidosis. Consequently, DT-CMR offers a 
      contrast-free tool to identify novel pathophysiology, improve diagnostics, and 
      monitor disease through noninvasive microstructural assessment.

TI  - Peripheral Nerves: Not Only Cross-sectional Area in the Era of Radiomics.
PG  - 175-180
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1701629 [doi]
AB  - The peripheral nervous system is increasingly being investigated using medical 
      imaging as a complement or in association with electrodiagnostics tests. The 
      application of imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI), allows detailed visualization of the peripheral nervous system. 
      According to the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, the use of US for 
      nerve evaluation is strongly encouraged. In addition, the role of US is further 
      enhanced by the wide application of US-guided techniques to diagnose or to treat 
      peripheral nerve disorders.Standard evaluation of peripheral nerves on US usually 
      relies on cross-sectional area evaluation with different cutoff values in the 
      osteofibrous tunnels and outside them. In several anatomical areas, side-to-side 
      comparison is highly recommended because it helps distinguish subtle variations by 
      using the unaffected limb as an internal control.US is widely used to perform 
      US-guided interventional procedures on peripheral nerves. The recent development of 
      radiomics and machine and deep learning applied to peripheral nerves may reveal new 
      insights beyond the capabilities of the human eye. Radiomics may have a role in 
      expanding the diagnostic capabilities of US and MRI in the study of peripheral nerve 
      pathology, especially when the cross-sectional area is not markedly increased.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder mostly 
      affecting the aging population over sixty. Cardinal symptoms including, tremors, 
      muscle rigidity, drooping posture, drooling, walking difficulty, and autonomic 
      symptoms appear when a significant number of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are 
      already destroyed. Hence we need early, sensitive, specific, and economical 
      peripheral and/or central biomarker(s) for the differential diagnosis, prognosis, 
      and treatment of PD. These can be classified as clinical, biochemical, genetic, 
      proteomic, and neuroimaging biomarkers. Novel discoveries of genetic as well as 
      nongenetic biomarkers may be utilized for the personalized treatment of PD during 
      preclinical (premotor) and clinical (motor) stages. Premotor biomarkers including 
      hyper-echogenicity of substantia nigra, olfactory and autonomic dysfunction, 
      depression, hyposmia, deafness, REM sleep disorder, and impulsive behavior may be 
      noticed during preclinical stage. Neuroimaging biomarkers (PET, SPECT, MRI), and 
      neuropsychological deficits can facilitate differential diagnosis. Single-cell 
      profiling of dopaminergic neurons has identified pyridoxal kinase and lysosomal 
      ATPase as biomarker genes for PD prognosis. Promising biomarkers include: fluid 
      biomarkers, neuromelanin antibodies, pathological forms of α-Syn, DJ-1, amyloid β 
      and tau in the CSF, patterns of gene expression, metabolomics, urate, as well as 
      protein profiling in the blood and CSF samples. Reduced brain regional 
      N-acetyl-aspartate is a biomarker for the in vivo assessment of neuronal loss using 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy and T2 relaxation time with MRI. To confirm PD 
      diagnosis, the PET biomarkers include [(18)F]-DOPA for estimating dopaminergic 
      neurotransmission, [(18)F]dG for mitochondrial bioenergetics, [(18)F]BMS for 
      mitochondrial complex-1, [(11)C](R)-PK11195 for microglial activation, SPECT imaging 
      with (123)Iflupane and βCIT for dopamine transporter, and urinary salsolinol and 
      8-hydroxy, 2-deoxyguanosine for neuronal loss. This brief review describes the 
      merits and limitations of recently discovered biomarkers and proposes coenzyme Q10, 
      mitochondrial ubiquinone-NADH oxidoreductase, melatonin, α-synculein index, Charnoly 
      body, and metallothioneins as novel biomarkers to confirm PD diagnosis for early and 
      effective treatment of PD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hinman syndrome is a rare disease with urodynamic findings and a clinical 
      course resembling neuropathic bladder, without a neuropathic etiology. Diffusion 
      tensor imaging is a special technique of magnetic resonance imaging that has 
      recently been used to evaluate the peripheral nerves but has been demonstrated to be 
      applicable for evaluation of the lumbosacral plexus. We examined the lumbosacral 
      plexus using diffusion tensor imaging, which has not previously been reported in 
      patients with Hinman syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 12 patients 
      who fulfilled criteria for Hinman syndrome, with severe bladder dysfunction on 
      urodynamics, renal scarring on scintigraphy and no pathological findings on magnetic 
      resonance imaging. The 12 subjects serving as controls required pelvic or spinal 
      magnetic resonance imaging for reasons other than spinal abnormalities. Evaluation 
      was performed with a 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system and 16-channel body 
      coil. Tractography was done to examine the lumbosacral plexus. Fractional anisotropy 
      and mean diffusivity were computed and compared between groups for the right and 
      left plexuses. RESULTS: Mean fractional anisotropy was 0.24 and 0.35 for the right 
      plexus in patients and controls, respectively, and 0.24 and 0.36 for the left 
      plexus. Mean diffusivity was 1.39 for the right and left plexuses in patients, and 
      1.28 for the right and left plexuses in controls (p <0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study focusing on the lumbosacral plexus as a possible origin of neuropathy 
      revealed abnormal findings in patients with Hinman syndrome resembling nerve injury 
      series. This is the first known study to provide data showing that Hinman syndrome 
      may have a neuropathic etiology.

AB  - This article provides a review of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and how to 
      get started. It explains step by step how to establish MRN at an institution: how to 
      set up MRN protocols, how to train technicians, what a report needs to contain, and 
      how relevant findings should be communicated to the referring physician. Advanced 
      imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging are only briefly discussed at 
      the end of the article because most of those techniques are difficult for beginners 
      and are still not considered standard in the clinical routine.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used 
      as a problem-solving tool for diagnosis and management of peripheral neuropathies. 
      This review is aimed at summarizing important technological advances, including MR 
      pulse sequence and surface coil developments, which have facilitated MRN's use in 
      clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: The most recent research in MRN focuses on its 
      clinical applications, with concomitant development of three-dimensional, parallel 
      imaging and vascular suppression techniques that facilitate higher spatial 
      resolution and depiction of small nerve branches arising from the brachial and 
      lumbosacral plexi as well as fascicular abnormalities of more distal extremity 
      nerves. Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been studied as a tool to 
      detect microstructural abnormalities of peripheral nerves and more precisely define 
      grades of nerve injury but will require additional investigation to determine its 
      role in daily clinical practice. MRN continues to evolve due to technological 
      improvements and awareness by the medical community of its capabilities. Additional 
      technological developments related to surface coil designs and vascular suppression 
      techniques will be needed to move the field forward.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of MRI in patients with suspected CRPS 
      (complex regional pain syndrome). METHOD: A retrospective health-record search was 
      conducted for patients with suspected CRPS (foot). Fifty patients with initially 
      suspected CRPS were included (37 females (51 ± 13 years) and 13 males (44 ± 15 
      years)). All patients underwent MRI. Two radiologists assessed skin, bone, and soft 
      tissue parameters on MRI. The final diagnosis was CRPS (Gold standard: Budapest 
      criteria) or non-CRPS. MRI parameters were compared between CRPS patients and 
      non-CRPS patients. RESULTS: CRPS was diagnosed in 22/50(44 %) patients. Skin 
      thickness (1.9 ± 0.5 mm vs. 1.7 ± 0.3 mm, p = 0.399), enhancement, and subcutaneous 
      edema showed no differences between CRPS and non-CRPS patients. Bone marrow edema 
      presence and pattern were not different between groups. Up to 50 % of CRPS patients 
      showed no bone marrow edema. Subcortical enhancement and periosteal enhancement were 
      not different between groups. For reader 1, muscle edema score was higher in the 
      non-CRPS group compared to the CRPS group (0.1 ± 0.2 vs. 0.6 ± 1.0, p = 0.008), but 
      not different for reader 2 (0.1 ± 0.5 vs. 0.2 ± 0.8, p = 0.819). Perfusion pattern 
      was more extensive in non-CRPS patients for reader 1 (p = 0.048), but not for reader 
      2 (p = 0.157). Joint effusions showed no difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: MRI 
      cannot distinguish between CRPS and non-CRPS patients. The role of MR imaging in 
      patients with suspected CRPS is to exclude alternative diagnoses that would better 
      explain patients' symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome is diagnosed based on history, physical 
      examination, and nerve conduction testing; however, there are no clear criteria for 
      the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Recently, studies have aimed to diagnose 
      carpal tunnel syndrome through ultrasound or MRI. The purpose of this study was to 
      compare and analyze the cross-sectional area of the median nerve between patients 
      with carpal tunnel syndrome and a control group. METHODS: From July 2015 to August 
      2017, we retrospectively analyzed fishery and white-collar workers (164 people, 37 
      men, 127 women). Carpal tunnel syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of both physical 
      examination and nerve conduction testing. A negative result in either test led to 
      exclusion from the study. RESULTS: In total, 164 wrist MRI were retrieved, with 67 
      patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and 97 patients allocated to the 
      control group. The mean value of cross-sectional area at the pisiform was 18.8 mm(2) 
      in the MRI of the carpal tunnel syndrome patients and 12.1 mm(2) (p-value <0.05) in 
      the control group. The mean value of cross-sectional area at the hook of hamate was 
      11.70 mm(2) and that at the control group was 11.67 mm(2) (p-value 0.055). 
      CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional area at pisiform in MRI is a valuable factor in the 
      diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome and in predicting the duration of pain.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      technique that measures the extent of restricted water diffusion and anisotropy in 
      biological tissue. Although DTI has been widely applied in the brain, more recently 
      researchers have used it to characterize nerve pathology in the setting of 
      entrapment neuropathy, traumatic injury, and tumor. DTI artifacts are exacerbated 
      when imaging off isocenter in the body. Anecdotally, the most significant artifacts 
      in peripheral nerve DTI include magnetic field inhomogeneity, motion, incomplete fat 
      suppression, aliasing, and distortion. High spatial resolution is also required to 
      reliably evaluate smaller peripheral nerves. This article provides an overview of 
      such technical issues, particularly when trying to apply DTI in the clinical 
      setting, and offers potential solutions. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5 Technical Efficacy:

AB  - AIM: To evaluate if diffusion-tensor-imaging MR-Neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect 
      lesions of peripheral nerves due to polyneuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
      METHODS: Ten patients with type 2 diabetes with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 patients 
      with type 2 diabetes without polyneuropathy (nDPN) as well as 20 healthy controls 
      (HC) were included. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions 
      (tibial nerve) of the lower extremity. Fractional-anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity 
      (mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD)) were calculated and compared to neuropathy 
      severity. Conventional T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density data were obtained 
      from a multi-echo SE sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity 
      of DTI-MRN from receiver operating characteristics (ROC). RESULTS: The proximal and 
      distal FA was lowest in patients with DPN compared with nDPN and HC (p < 0.01). 
      Likewise, proximal and distal RD was highest in patients with DPN (p < 0.01). MD and 
      AD were also significantly different though less pronounced. ROC curve analyses of 
      DTI separated nDPN and DPN with area-under-the-curve values ranging from 0.65 to 
      0.98. T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density could not differentiate between 
      nDPN and DPN. CONCLUSION: DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and 
      higher RD. These alterations are likely to reflect both proximal and distal nerve 
      fiber pathology in patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Diffuse tensor imaging of lower extremities: a novel MR imaging technique for 
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.
PG  - 771-778
LID - 10.1007/s10549-020-05897-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is caused by drug-induced 
      damage to the axons which is not detected easily due to lack of reliable, clinically 
      applicable modalities. Diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) allows for quantitative 
      measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), 
      which have been shown to detect nerve injury by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). 
      METHODS: We sought to evaluate if DTI could be used for detection of CIPN in 
      patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane. Patients with h/o exposure to 
      neurotoxic chemotherapy, diabetes, or peripheral neuropathy were excluded. Patients 
      completed pre- and post-chemotherapy MRI of bilateral legs and FACT&GOG-Ntx. 
      Genotyping of single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) was performed to detect known 
      associations with CIPN. RESULTS: We had 14 evaluable patients in this prospective 
      trial. Mean FA values post-chemotherapy were significantly lower than baseline at 
      mid-calf (p < 0.0001) and ankle (p = 0.03). We did not find any significant change 
      in mean ADC values. In patients without symptomatic neuropathy, mean FA values 
      decreased more than symptomatic patients at mid-calf (p < 0.001). Of the 41 
      genotyped SNVs, only rs8110536 was found to be significantly associated with 
      development of CIPN. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that FA values are indicative of 
      CIPN and differential changes in FA values in symptomatic versus asymptomatic 
      patients highlights its potential to be further studied as a predictive biomarker 
      for CIPN. This is the first study to highlight a non-invasive, imaging based, 
      objective biomarker which, if validated, can be translated into clinic easily.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the potential value of magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in characterizing changes in the 
      cervical spinal cord and peripheral nerve roots in vivo in patients with spinal 
      muscular atrophy (SMA). METHODS: We developed an MRI protocol with 4 sequences to 
      investigate the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots on a 3 Tesla MRI system. We 
      used 2 anatomical MRI sequences to investigate cross-sectional area (CSA) at each 
      spinal segment and the diameter of ventral and dorsal nerve roots, and two diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) techniques to estimate the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean 
      (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in 10 SMA patients and 20 healthy 
      controls. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in CSA (p > .1), although 
      an 8.5% reduction of CSA in patients compared to healthy controls was apparent at 
      segment C7. DTI data showed a higher AD in grey matter of patients compared to 
      healthy controls (p = .033). Significantly lower MD, AD and RD values were found in 
      rostral nerve roots (C3-C5) in patients (p < .045). CONCLUSIONS: We showed 
      feasibility of an advanced 3 T MRI protocol that allowed differences to be 
      determined between patients and healthy controls, confirming the potential of this 
      technique to assess pathological mechanisms in SMA. After further development and 
      confirmation of findings in a larger sample, these techniques may be used to study 
      disease course of SMA in vivo and evaluate response to survival motor neuron (SMN) 
      augmenting therapy.

TI  - Combining inhomogeneous magnetization transfer and multipoint Dixon acquisition: 
      Potential utility and evaluation.
PG  - 2136-2144
LID - 10.1002/mrm.28571 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The recently introduced inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) method 
      has predominantly been applied for imaging the central nervous system. Future 
      applications of ihMT, such as in peripheral nerves and muscles, will involve imaging 
      in the vicinity of adipose tissues. This work aims to systematically investigate the 
      partial volume effect of fat on the ihMT signal and to propose an efficient 
      fat-separation method that does not interfere with ihMT measurements. METHODS: 
      First, the influence of fat on ihMT signal was studied using simulations. Next, the 
      ihMT sequence was combined with a multi-echo Dixon acquisition for fat separation. 
      The sequence was tested in 9 healthy volunteers using a 3T human scanner. The ihMT 
      ratio (ihMTR) values were calculated in regions of interest in the brain and the 
      spinal cord using standard acquisition (no fat saturation), water-only, in-phase, 
      and out-of-phase reconstructions. The values obtained were compared with a standard 
      fat suppression method, spectral presaturation with inversion recovery. RESULTS: 
      Simulations showed variations in the ihMTR values in the presence of fat, depending 
      on the TEs used. The IhMTR values in the brain and spinal cord derived from the 
      water-only ihMT multi-echo Dixon images were in good agreement with values from the 
      unsuppressed sequence. The ihMT-spectral presaturation with inversion recovery 
      combination resulted in 24%-35% lower ihMTR values compared with the standard 
      non-fat-suppressed acquisition. CONCLUSION: The presence of fat within a voxel 
      affects the ihMTR calculations. The IhMT multi-echo Dixon method does not compromise 
      the observable ihMT effect and can potentially be used to remove fat influence in 
      ihMT.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of microstructural alterations in the trigeminal nerve due 
      to neurovascular contact/compression.
PG  - 1407-1413
LID - 10.1007/s00701-019-03851-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several recent studies have focused on microstructural changes in the 
      trigeminal nerve in trigeminal neuralgia using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). 
      However, alterations after microvascular decompression (MVD) have rarely been 
      investigated. Furthermore, the trigeminal nerve of asymptomatic individuals also 
      presenting with neurovascular contact/compression (NVC) has not yet been studied. 
      METHODS: Thirty-four patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia and 34 healthy 
      age-matched controls, who were identified as having unilateral NVC signs, underwent 
      both DTI and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for comparison. All 
      trigeminal neuralgia patients underwent a post-surgical MRI scan after 7 days and a 
      follow-up MRI scan within 6-8 months after surgery. The apparent diffusion 
      coefficients (ADCs) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured from coronal 
      images in which the nerves from the root exit point to the distal segment were 
      clearly shown. RESULTS: In 34 trigeminal neuralgia patients, the absolute FA value 
      was significantly lower on the affected side (mean FA, 0.34 ± 0.03) than on the 
      unaffected side (mean FA, 0.37 ± 0.05, p < 0.001). The FA ratio was also 
      significantly different between the trigeminal neuralgia group (Rs(FA), 0.92 ± 0.06) 
      and the control group (Rs(FA), 0.99 ± 0.09) (p = 0.001). The absolute ADC value 
      between the two sides in patients and the ratios of ADC between the trigeminal 
      neuralgia and control groups did not show any significant differences (p = 0.21 and 
      0.29, respectively). However, in 34 healthy subjects presenting with signs of NVC, 
      neither the FA value nor the ADC showed a difference between sides (p > 0.05). The 
      FA ratio of patients showed a significant increase on two follow-up MRI scans 
      compared to the preoperative FA (p = 0.02 and 0.002, respectively), while the ADC 
      ratio showed a significant decrease at 6 months after MVD (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: 
      This study of trigeminal neuralgia due to NVC found that DTI indexes could reflect 
      alterations in the affected trigeminal nerve. Furthermore, a reversible change after 
      MVD surgery could be potentially valuable for monitoring the change in white matter 
      of the trigeminal nerve.

TI  - Length-dependent MRI of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
PG  - 15-25
LID - 10.1002/acn3.50953 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is caused 
      by heterozygous deletion of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Patients 
      with HNPP present multifocal, reversible sensory/motor deficits due to increased 
      susceptibility to mechanical pressure. Additionally, age-dependent axonal 
      degeneration is reported. We hypothesize that length-dependent axonal loss can be 
      revealed by MRI, irrespective of the multifocal phenotype in HNPP. METHODS: Nerve 
      and muscle MRI data were acquired in the proximal and distal leg of patients with 
      HNPP (n = 10) and matched controls (n = 7). More specifically, nerve magnetization 
      transfer ratios (MTR) were evaluated to assay proximal-to-distal gradients in nerve 
      degeneration, while intramuscular fat percentages (F(per) ) were evaluated to assay 
      muscle fat replacement following denervation. Neurological disabilities were 
      assessed via the Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy score (CMTNS) for correlation with 
      MRI. RESULTS: F(per) values were elevated in HNPP proximal muscle (9.8 ± 2.2%, 
      P = 0.01) compared to controls (6.9 ± 1.0%). We observed this same elevation of HNPP 
      distal muscles (10.5 ± 2.5%, P < 0.01) relative to controls (6.3 ± 1.1%). 
      Additionally, the amplitude of the proximal-to-distal gradient in F(per) was more 
      significant in HNPP patients than controls (P < 0.01), suggesting length-dependent 
      axonal loss. In contrast, nerve MTR values were similar between HNPP subjects 
      (sciatic/tibial nerves = 39.4 ± 2.0/34.2 ± 2.5%) and controls (sciatic/tibial 
      nerves = 37.6 ± 3.8/35.5 ± 1.2%). Proximal muscle F(per) values were related to 
      CMTNS (r = 0.69, P = 0.03), while distal muscle F(per) and sciatic/tibial nerve MTR 
      values were not related to disability. INTERPRETATION: Despite the multifocal nature 
      of the HNPP phenotype, muscle F(per) measurements relate to disability and exhibit a 
      proximal-to-distal gradient consistent with length-dependent axonal loss, suggesting 
      that F(per) may be a viable biomarker of disease progression in HNPP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to investigate glaucomatous morphological 
      changes quantitatively in the visual cortex of the brain with voxel-based 
      morphometry (VBM), a normalizing MRI technique, and to clarify the relationship 
      between glaucomatous damage and regional changes in the visual cortex of patients 
      with open-angle glaucoma (OAG). METHODS: Thirty-one patients with OAG (age: 55.9 ± 
      10.7, male: female = 9: 22) and 20 age-matched controls (age: 54.9 ± 9.8, male: 
      female = 10: 10) were included in this study. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the 
      optic nerve was manually measured with T2-weighed MRI. Images of the visual cortex 
      were acquired with T1-weighed 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with 
      gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequencing, and the normalized regional visual cortex volume, 
      i.e., gray matter density (GMD), in Brodmann areas (BA) 17, 18, and 19, was 
      calculated with a normalizing technique based on statistic parametric mapping 8 
      (SPM8) analysis. We compared the regional GMD of the visual cortex in the control 
      subjects and OAG patients. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to 
      determine the relationship between optic nerve CSA and GMD in BA 17, 18, and 19. 
      RESULTS: We found that the normal and OAG patients differed significantly in optic 
      nerve CSA (p < 0.001) and visual cortex GMD in BA 17 (p = 0.030), BA 18 (p = 0.003), 
      and BA 19 (p = 0.005). In addition, we found a significant correlation between optic 
      nerve CSA and visual cortex GMD in BA 19 (r = 0.33, p = 0.023), but not in BA 17 (r 
      = 0.17, p = 0.237) or BA 18 (r = 0.24, p = 0.099). CONCLUSION: Quantitative MRI 
      parametric evaluation of GMD can detect glaucoma-associated anatomical atrophy of 
      the visual cortex in BA 17, 18, and 19. Furthermore, GMD in BA 19 was significantly 
      correlated to the damage level of the optic nerve, as well as the retina, in 
      patients with OAG. This is the first demonstration of an association between the 
      cortex of the brain responsible for higher-order visual function and glaucoma 
      severity. Evaluation of the visual cortex with MRI is thus a very promising 
      potential method for objective examination in OAG.

TI  - Quantitative magnetic resonance evaluation of the trigeminal nerve in familial 
      dysautonomia.
PG  - 469-473
LID - 10.1007/s10286-019-00593-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease that 
      affects the development of sensory and autonomic neurons, including those in the 
      cranial nerves. We aimed to determine whether conventional brain magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) could detect morphologic changes in the trigeminal nerves of these 
      patients. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of brain MRI of patients with 
      genetically confirmed FD and age- and sex-matched controls. High-resolution 3D 
      gradient-echo T1-weighted sequences were used to obtain measurements of the 
      cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerves. Measurements were obtained using a 
      two-reader consensus. RESULTS: Twenty pairs of trigeminal nerves were assessed in 
      ten patients with FD and ten matched controls. The median (interquartile range) 
      cross-sectional area of the trigeminal nerves in patients with FD was 3.5 
      (2.1) mm(2), compared to 5.9 (2.0) mm(2) in controls (P < 0.001). No association 
      between trigeminal nerve area and age was found in patients or controls. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using conventional MRI, the caliber of the trigeminal nerves was 
      significantly reduced bilaterally in patients with FD compared to controls, a 
      finding that appears to be highly characteristic of this disorder. The lack of 
      correlation between age and trigeminal nerve size supports arrested neuronal 
      development rather than progressive atrophy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of fiber tractography and diffusivity 
      analysis generated from 3D diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences for preoperative 
      assessment of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. METHOD: MR imaging at 3 T was 
      performed in 22 patients (mean age 41.9 ± 17.1y, 13 women) with histologically 
      confirmed schwannomas (N = 18) and histologically confirmed neurofibromas (N = 11), 
      including a 3D DW turbo spin echo sequence with fat suppression. Diffusion tensor 
      parameters were computed and fiber tracks were determined. Evaluation was performed 
      by two radiologists and one orthopedic surgeon blinded for final diagnosis. Mean 
      diffusivity was computed to allow further assessment of tumor microstructure. 
      Preoperative fascicle visualization was graded, fascicles were categorized regarding 
      anatomical location and amount of fascicles surrounding the tumor. The agreement of 
      imaging findings with intraoperative findings was assessed. RESULTS: On 78.3 % of 
      the DTI images, the fascicle visualization was rated as good or very good. 
      Tractography differences were observed in schwannomas and neurofibromas, showing 
      schwannomas to be significantly more often located eccentrically to the nerve (94.8 
      %) than neurofibromas (0 %, P < 0.01). Fascicles were significantly more often 
      continuous (87.5 %) in schwannomas, while in neurofibromas, none of the tracks was 
      graded to be continuous (0 %, P = 0.014). A substantial agreement between fiber 
      tracking and surgical anatomy was found regarding the fascicle courses surrounding 
      the tumor (κ = 0.78). Mean diffusivity of schwannomas (1.5 ± 0.2 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) 
      was significantly lower than in neurofibromas (1.8 ± 0.2 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; 
      P < 0.001). The Youden index showed an optimal cutoff at 1.7 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s 
      (sensitivity, 0.91; specificity, 0.78; J = 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative 
      diffusion tensor imaging allowed to accurately differentiate between schwannomas and 
      neurofibromas and to describe their location in relation to the nerve fascicles for 
      preoperative planning.

LID - 10.1007/s00256-019-03182-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the nerves of patients 
      with diabetic amyotrophy (DA) using magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) with 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty controls and 13 DA 
      cases were analyzed. 1.5-Tesla and 3.0-Tesla MRN with DTI was used. Qualitative data 
      from 13 patient records were recorded. Region of interest (ROI) measurements were 
      taken of bilateral L3 through S2 lumbosacral nerve roots, femoral nerves, and 
      sciatic nerves. An ANOVA and multiple linear regression analysis were performed. An 
      intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated between two readers. 
      RESULTS: In DA cases, abnormalities of the lumbosacral nerve roots (n = 11 
      patients), sciatic (n = 10), femoral (n = 13), and obturator nerves (n = 4) were 
      seen; denervation changes of the abdominopelvic muscles were also identified. 
      Quantitatively, minimum and mean nerve signals on B600 were significantly less than 
      controls (p < 0.001). Minimum and mean ADC values were significantly greater in 
      cases than in controls (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively). Mean fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) values were significantly lower in cases than in controls 
      (p = 0.041). There were no significant differences in the minimum FA values between 
      cases and controls. Minimum and mean ADCs correlated positively with highest 
      recorded hemoglobin A1 (HbA1c) while controlling for sex, age, and BMI (β = 0.518, 
      p < 0.001 and β = 0.302, p = 0.020 respectively). ICCs were 0.892 (B600), 0.717 
      (ADC), and 0.730 (FA). CONCLUSION: Neuromuscular lesions secondary to DA are 
      qualitatively and quantitatively identified on MRN with DTI, and a positive 
      correlation of ADC levels with serum HbA1c levels exists. Thus, MRN with DTI can be 
      employed as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, if DA is suspected.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the potential of magnetic resonance (MR) 
      micro-neurography to detect morphological and relaxometric changes in distal tibial 
      nerves in patients affected with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy 
      (CIDP), and their associations with clinical and electrophysiological features. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 10 subjects affected with CIDP and 10 healthy subjects were 
      examined. Multiple MR parameters, including the number of fascicles (N), fascicles 
      diameter (FD), total fascicles area (FA), epineurium area (EA), total nerve area 
      (NA), fascicles to nerve ratio (FNR) and quantitative T2 and proton density (PD) 
      were investigated on high resolution MR images of the distal tibial nerve. Those 
      parameters were correlated with clinical scores, age of onset, disease duration and 
      electrophysiologic data. RESULTS: Median NA and FA were significantly increased in 
      the CIDP population (median values for NA in cm(2) in CIDP: 0.185; controls: 0.135; 
      p: 0.028; for FA in CIDP 0.136; controls 0.094; p: 0.021). There was no correlation 
      between the parameters investigated and clinical or electrophysiologic features. 
      CONCLUSION: MR microneurography can detect increased total nerve and fascicle area 
      in distal tibial nerves in CIDP and may be useful for diagnosing CIDP.

TI  - Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging to Evaluate Microstructural Changes and Outcomes 
      after Radiofrequency Rhizotomy of Trigeminal Nerves in Patients with Trigeminal 
      Neuralgia.

AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by facial pain that may be sudden, intense, 
      and recurrent. Our aim was to investigate microstructural tissue changes of the 
      trigeminal nerve in patients with trigeminal neuralgia resulting from neurovascular 
      compression by diffusion tensor imaging, and to test the predictive value of 
      diffusion tensor imaging for determining outcomes after radiofrequency rhizotomy. 
      Forty-three patients with trigeminal neuralgia were recruited, and diffusion tensor 
      imaging was performed before radiofrequency rhizotomy. By selecting the cisternal 
      segment of the trigeminal nerve manually, we measured the volume of trigeminal 
      nerve, fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, axial diffusivity, and 
      radial diffusivity. The apparent diffusion coefficient and mean value of fractional 
      anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were compared between the 
      affected and normal side in the same patient, and were correlated with pre-rhizotomy 
      and post-rhizotomy visual analogue scale pain scores. The results showed the 
      affected side had significantly decreased fractional anisotropy, increased apparent 
      diffusion coefficient and radial diffusivity, and no significant change of axial 
      diffusivity. The volume of the trigeminal nerve on affected side was also 
      significantly smaller. There was a trend of fractional anisotropy reduction and 
      visual analogue scale pain score reduction (P = 0.072). The results suggest that 
      demyelination without axonal injury, and decreased size of the trigeminal nerve, are 
      the microstructural abnormalities of the trigeminal nerve in patients with 
      trigeminal neuralgia caused by neurovascular compression. The application of 
      diffusion tensor imaging in understanding the pathophysiology of trigeminal 
      neuralgia, and predicting the treatment effect has potential and warrants further 
      study.

TI  - Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predicts Peripheral Nerve Recovery in a Rat 
      Sciatic Nerve Injury Model.
PG  - 949-956

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nerve regeneration after an injury should occur in a timely fashion for 
      function to be restored. Current methods cannot monitor regeneration prior to muscle 
      reinnervation. Diffusion tensor imaging has been previously shown to provide 
      quantitative indices after nerve recovery. The goal of this study was to validate 
      the use of this technology following nerve injury via a series of rat sciatic nerve 
      injury/repair studies. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were prospectively divided by 
      procedure (sham, crush, or cut/repair) and time points (1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after 
      surgery). At the appropriate time point, each animal was euthanized and the sciatic 
      nerve was harvested and fixed. Data were obtained using a 7-Tesla magnetic resonance 
      imaging system. For validation, findings were compared to behavioral testing (foot 
      fault asymmetry and sciatic function index) and cross-sectional axonal counting of 
      toluidine blue-stained sections examined under light microscopy. RESULTS: 
      Sixty-three rats were divided into three treatment groups (sham, n = 21; crush, n = 
      23; and cut/repair, n = 19). Fractional anisotropy was able to differentiate between 
      recovery following sham, crush, and cut/repair injuries as early as 2 weeks (p < 
      0.05), with more accurate differentiation thereafter. More importantly, the 
      difference in anisotropy between distal and proximal regions recognized animals with 
      successful and failed recoveries according to behavioral analysis, especially at 12 
      weeks. In addition, diffusion tension imaging-based tractography provided a visual 
      representation of nerve continuity in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse 
      tensor imaging is an objective and noninvasive tool for monitoring nerve 
      regeneration. Its use could facilitate earlier detection of failed repairs to 
      potentially help improve outcomes.

TI  - MRI quantifies lumbosacral nerve root and sciatic nerve hypertrophy in chronic

AB  - PURPOSE: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a 
      treatable, immune-mediated condition characterised by progressive or relapsing motor 
      and sensory neurological deficits. The diagnosis is based on a combination of 
      clinical, neurophysiological and supportive criteria, but can be challenging. In 
      this study, we quantified the diameter and cross-sectional area of the lumbosacral 
      nerve roots, and explored the imaging characteristics of the sciatic nerves, in 
      patients with CIDP versus healthy controls using MRI. METHODS: MRI of the 
      lumbosacral plexus and both thighs was performed at 3 T. Orthogonal diameter and 
      cross-sectional area of the lumbosacral nerve roots were measured, along with 
      sciatic nerve cross-sectional area at the mid-thigh level. The MRI appearance of the 
      sciatic nerves was also evaluated qualitatively. All measurements were performed by 
      an observer blinded to the diagnosis. RESULTS: 10 patients with CIDP and 10 healthy 
      controls (age and sex-matched) were studied. Lumbosacral nerve root diameter and 
      cross-sectional area were significantly increased in patients with CIDP compared to 
      controls (mean diameter 6.0 ± 1.1 mm vs 4.8 ± 0.3 mm; p = 0.006), with a high 
      sensitivity (89 %) and specificity (90 %) on ROC analysis. Sciatic nerve cross 
      sectional area was also significantly increased in the CIDP group, and was 
      accompanied by qualitative MRI changes. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative MRI reveals 
      significant hypertrophy of the lumbosacral nerve roots and sciatic nerves in 
      patients with CIDP compared to controls. This study provides further evidence for 
      the inclusion of lumbosacral nerve root and sciatic nerve hypertrophy on MRI as a 
      supportive feature in the diagnostic criteria for CIDP.

LID - 10.3171/2019.9.FOCUS19619 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While conventional imaging can readily identify ventricular enlargement 
      in hydrocephalus, structural changes that underlie microscopic tissue injury might 
      be more difficult to capture. MRI-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) uses 
      properties of water motion to uncover changes in the tissue microenvironment. The 
      authors hypothesized that DTI can identify alterations in optic nerve microstructure 
      in children with hydrocephalus. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 21 
      children (< 18 years old) who underwent DTI before and after neurosurgical 
      intervention for acute obstructive hydrocephalus from posterior fossa tumors. Their 
      optic nerve quantitative DTI metrics of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) were compared to those of 21 age-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: 
      Patients with hydrocephalus had increased MD and decreased FA in bilateral optic 
      nerves, compared to controls (p < 0.001). Normalization of bilateral optic nerve MD 
      and FA on short-term follow-up (median 1 day) after neurosurgical intervention was 
      observed, as was near-complete recovery of MD on long-term follow-up (median 1.8 
      years). CONCLUSIONS: DTI was used to demonstrate reversible alterations of optic 
      nerve microstructure in children presenting acutely with obstructive hydrocephalus. 
      Alterations in optic nerve MD and FA returned to near-normal levels on short- and 
      long-term follow-up, suggesting that surgical intervention can restore optic nerve 
      tissue microstructure. This technique is a safe, noninvasive imaging tool that 
      quantifies alterations of neural tissue, with a potential role for evaluation of 
      pediatric hydrocephalus.

      interosseous nerve syndrome (AINS), this proof of principle study aims to quantify 
      the extent of structural damage of a peripheral nerve at the anatomical level of 
      individual fascicles. METHODS: In this institutional review board approved 
      prospective study 13 patients with spontaneous AINS were examined at 3 Tesla 
      including a transversal T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo and a spin-echo 
      echo-planar-imaging pulse sequence of the upper arm level. Calculations of 
      quantitative DTI parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity 
      (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) for median nerve lesion 
      and non-lesion fascicles as well as ulnar and radial nerve were obtained. DTI values 
      were compared to each other and to a previously published dataset of 58 healthy 
      controls using one-way Analysis of Variance with Bonferroni correction and p-values 
      <.05 were considered significant. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
      were performed to assess diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: FA of median nerve lesion 
      fascicles was decreased compared to median nerve non-lesion fascicles, ulnar nerve 
      and radial nerve while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p < .001 for all parameters). 
      Compared to median nerve values of healthy controls, lesion fascicles showed a 
      significant decrease in FA while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p < .001 for all 
      parameters). FA of median nerve non-lesion fascicles showed a weak significant 
      decrease compared to healthy controls (p < .01) while there was no difference in MD, 
      RD, and AD. ROC analyses revealed an excellent diagnostic accuracy of FA, MD and RD 
      in the discrimination of median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles in AINS 
      patients as well as in the discrimination of lesion fascicles and normative median 
      nerve values of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: By applying this functional MR 
      Neurography technique in patients with AINS, this proof of principle study 
      demonstrates that diffusion tensor imaging is feasible to quantify structural nerve 
      injury at the anatomical level of individual fascicles.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of the sciatic nerve in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type I 
      patients: a prospective case-control study.
PG  - 3241-3252
LID - 10.1007/s00330-018-5958-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      parameters and cross-sectional area (CSA) can differentiate between the sciatic 
      nerve of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease type I (demyelinating form) patients and 
      that of controls. METHODS: This prospective comparison study included 18 CMT type I 
      patients and 18 age/sex-matched volunteers. Magnetic resonance imaging including DTI 
      and axial T2-weighted Dixon sequence was performed for each subject. Region of 
      interest analysis was independently performed by two radiologists on each side of 
      the sciatic nerve at four levels: hamstring tendon origin (level 1), lesser 
      trochanter of the femur (level 2), gluteus maximus tendon insertion (level 3), and 
      mid-femur (level 4). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial 
      diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were calculated. The CSA of the 
      sciatic nerve bundle was measured using axial water-only image at each level. 
      Comparisons of DTI parameters between the two groups were performed using the 
      two-sample t test and Mann-Whitney U test. Interobserver agreement analysis was also 
      conducted. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was excellent for all DTI parameter 
      analyses. FA was significantly lower at all four levels in CMT patients than 
      controls. RD, MD, and CSA were significantly higher at all four levels in CMT 
      patients. AD was significantly higher at level 2 in CMT patients. CONCLUSION: DTI 
      assessment of the sciatic nerve is reproducible and can discriminate the 
      demyelinating nerve pathology of CMT type I patients from normal nerves. The CSA of 
      the sciatic nerve is also a potential parameter for diagnosing nerve abnormality in 
      CMT type I patients. KEY POINTS: • Diffusion tensor imaging parameters of the 
      sciatic nerve at proximal to mid-femur level revealed significant differences 
      between the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease patients and controls. • The cross-sectional 
      area of the sciatic nerve was significantly larger in the Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
      disease patients. • Interobserver agreement was excellent (intraclass coefficient 
      > 0.8) for all diffusion tensor imaging parameter analyses.

TI  - Functional MR Neurography in Evaluation of Peripheral Nerve Trauma and Postsurgical 
      Assessment.
PG  - 427-446
LID - 10.1148/rg.2019180112 [doi]
AB  - Evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries has classically been based on 
      clinical and electrophysiologic criteria. US and MRI have been widely used for 
      morphologic assessment of nerve injury sites and concomitant lesions. In the past 
      few years, morphologic MR neurography has significantly increased its clinical 
      applications on the basis of three-dimensional or two-dimensional images with and 
      without fat-suppression techniques. However, these sequences have a major drawback: 
      absence of pathophysiologic information about functional integrity or axonal flow of 
      peripheral nerves. In this scenario, functional MRI techniques such as 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used as a 
      complementary tool in initial evaluation of peripheral nerve trauma or in assessment 
      of trauma undergoing surgical repair. These approaches provide not only morphologic 
      but also functional information about extent and degree of nerve impairment. 
      Functional MR neurography can also be applied to selection, planning, and monitoring 
      of surgical procedures that can be performed after traumatic peripheral nerve 
      injuries, such as neurorrhaphy, nerve graft, or neurolysis, as it provides surgeons 
      with valuable information about the functional status of the nerves involved and 
      axonal flow integrity. The physical basis of DWI and DTI and the technical 
      adjustments required for their appropriate performance for peripheral nerve 
      evaluation are reviewed. Also, the clinical value of DWI and DTI in assessment of 
      peripheral nerve trauma is discussed, enhancing their potential impact on selection, 
      planning, and monitoring of surgical procedures employed for peripheral nerve 
      repair. Online supplemental material is available for this article. (©)RSNA, 2019.

TI  - MR neurography biomarkers to characterize peripheral neuropathy in AL amyloidosis.
PG  - e625-e634
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000006002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect, localize, and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in amyloid 
      light chain (AL) amyloidosis by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in correlation 
      with clinical and electrophysiologic findings. METHODS: We prospectively examined 20 
      patients with AL-polyneuropathy (PNP) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy 
      volunteers. After detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic testing, the patient 
      group was subdivided into mild and moderate PNP. MRN in a 3.0 tesla scanner with 
      anatomical coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to the 
      tibiotalar joint was performed by using T2-weighted and dual-echo 2-dimensional 
      sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3-dimensional, T2-weighted inversion 
      recovery sequence. Besides evaluation of nerve T2-weighted signal, detailed 
      quantification of nerve injury by morphometric (nerve caliber) and microstructural 
      MRN markers (proton spin density, T2 relaxation time) was conducted. RESULTS: Nerve 
      T2-weighted signal increase correlated with disease severity: moderate (420.2 ± 
      60.1) vs mild AL-PNP (307.2 ± 17.9; p = 0.0003) vs controls (207.0 ± 6.4; p < 
      0.0001). Proton spin density was also higher in moderate (tibial: 525.5 ± 53.0; 
      peroneal: 553.6 ± 64.5; sural: 492.0 ± 56.6) and mild AL-PNP (tibial: 431.6 ± 22.0; 
      peroneal: 457.6 ± 21.7; sural: 404.8 ± 25.2) vs controls (tibial: 310.5 ± 14.1; 
      peroneal: 313.6 ± 11.6; sural: 261.7 ± 11.0; p < 0.0001 for all nerves). T2 
      relaxation time was elevated in moderate AL-PNP only (tibial: p = 0.0106; peroneal: 
      p = 0.0070; sural: p = 0.0190). Tibial nerve caliber was higher in moderate (58.0 ± 
      8.8 mm(3)) vs mild AL-PNP (46.5 ± 2.5 mm(3); p = 0.008) vs controls (39.1 ± 1.2 
      mm(3); p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: MRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve injury 
      in AL-PNP in vivo with high sensitivity and in close correlation with the clinical 
      stage. Quantitative parameters are feasible new imaging biomarkers for the detection 
      of early AL-PNP and might help to monitor microstructural nerve tissue changes under 
      treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use anatomic measurements on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
      ultrasonography (USG) in diagnosing and grading carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) using 
      nerve conduction studies (NCS) as the gold standard. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this 
      prospective study, 26 patients with CTS (45 wrists; 22 female and 4 male patients; 
      mean ± SD age of 49.42 + 14.47 years) and 19 age and sex matched healthy volunteers 
      (32 wrists; 15 female and 4 male volunteers, mean ± SD age of 42.52 + 10.85 years) 
      underwent MRI and USG. Cross-sectional area (CA) of median nerve was measured using 
      free hand ROI at four levels: hamate hook (H0), pisiform bone (PI0), 1 cm proximal 
      (PI1) and 2 cm proximal to PI0 (PI2). Relative median nerve signal intensity (MNSI) 
      was calculated as ratio of median nerve signal intensity with hypothenar muscle 
      signal intensity. Flexor retinacular bowing was calculated at hamate hook level. 
      Echogenicity and Power Doppler vascularity of median nerve were assessed on USG. 
      Independent t-test, chi square test and receiver operating characteristic curve 
      analysis were used as appropriate. RESULTS: On USG, CA measured at PI0 (95% 
      confidence interval of 0.872-0.987) and retinacular bowing (0.816-0.912), while, on 
      MRI, CA at PI1 (0.874-0.997) were most useful in diagnosing CTS based on the ROC and 
      Zombie plot analysis. Area under curves for CA measurements on USG and MRI were not 
      significantly different. CA at PI1 on MRI (0.752-0.965) was significantly different 
      between minimal to moderate CTS and severe to extreme CTS groups (on NCS). 
      CONCLUSION: CA of median nerve is the most useful parameter to diagnose and grade 
      CTS and USG and MRI are comparable for measurements. Increased retinacular bowing on 
      USG and hypoechogenicity of median nerve increase the diagnostic confidence while 
      MRI helps in picking up important associated conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To delineate the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) values of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy by 
      diffusion tensor imaging and fiber bundle tracing. METHODS: Thirty patients with 
      cervical spondylotic radiculopathy and 24 healthy volunteers were assessed using the 
      International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury scale. 
      All subjects underwent conventional sagittal T1- and T2-weighted imaging and 
      horizontal 3-dimensional T2 driven equilibrium radiofrequency reset pulse and 
      diffusion tensor imaging scan. The ADC and FA values were measured in the cervical 
      nerve at most stenotic segment and heterolateral nonstenotic segment of patients. 
      RESULTS: Fiber tractography revealed thinned and sparse nerve roots and disruption 
      of the fiber bundles in patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy. The FA 
      values of C5-C8 in healthy volunteers or heterolateral nonstenotic nerve of patients 
      with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy were significantly greater than those of the 
      stenotic cervical segments of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (both 
      P < 0.01). Furthermore, the ADC values of C5-C8 in healthy volunteers or 
      heterolateral nonstenotic nerve of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy 
      were significantly lower than those of the stenotic cervical segments of cervical 
      spondylotic radiculopathy patients (both P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Fiber tractography 
      is capable of delineating microstructural changes of cervical nerve roots and 
      cervical spondylotic radiculopathy exhibits significant changes in FA and ADC 
      values.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging: A biomarker of outcome in Krabbe's disease.
PG  - 1108-15
LID - 10.1002/jnr.23769 [doi]
AB  - Krabbe's disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder resulting from 
      deficiency of β-galactocerebrosidase that affects primarily cerebral white matter 
      and peripheral nerves. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to 
      changes in white matter myelination, but its assessment is based purely on 
      qualitative, visual inspection, and it is subject to interobserver variability and 
      open to reader bias. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced MRI technique 
      that provides quantitative information about the microscopic structural organization 
      of the white matter and changes in cell density and myelination, and it is a 
      suitable MRI tool for studying Krabbe's disease. This Review discusses the available 
      studies on the application of quantitative DTI analysis to assess white matter 
      changes in patients with Krabbe's disease. Quantitative analysis of DTI scalars, 
      especially radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, has been shown to be a 
      sensitive in vivo biomarker of white matter microstructural damage in Krabbe's 
      disease, to detect early white matter injury in asymptomatic neonates with Krabbe's 
      disease, to predict motor and cognitive functions after hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplantation (HSCT), and to serve as a measurement for monitoring effects of HSCT 
      on white matter development in Krabbe's disease. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful radiologic tool with the ability to 
      generate a variety of proton-based signal contrast from tissues. Owing to this 
      immense flexibility in signal generation, new MRI techniques are constantly being 
      developed, tested, and optimized for clinical utility. In addition, the safe and 
      nonionizing nature of MRI makes it a suitable modality for imaging in children. In 
      this review article, we summarize a few of the most popular advances in MRI 
      techniques in recent years. In particular, we highlight how these new developments 
      have affected brain, spine, and neuromuscular imaging and focus on their 
      applications in pediatric patients. In the first part of the review, we discuss new 
      approaches such as multiphase and multidelay arterial spin labeling for quantitative 
      perfusion and angiography of the brain, amide proton transfer MRI of the brain, MRI 
      of brachial plexus and lumbar plexus nerves (i.e., neurography), and T2 mapping and 
      fat characterization in neuromuscular diseases. In the second part of the review, we 
      focus on describing new data acquisition strategies in accelerated MRI aimed 
      collectively at reducing the scan time, including simultaneous multislice imaging, 
      compressed sensing, synthetic MRI, and magnetic resonance fingerprinting. In 
      discussing the aforementioned, the review also summarizes the advantages and 
      disadvantages of each method and their current state of commercial availability from 
      MRI vendors.

AB  - Assessment of myelin integrity in peripheral nerve injuries and pathologies has 
      largely been limited to post-mortem analysis owing to the difficulty in obtaining 
      biopsies without affecting nerve function. This is further encumbered  by the small 
      size of the tissue and its location. Therefore, the development of robust, 
      non-invasive methods is highly attractive. In this study, we used magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) techniques, including magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), to 
      longitudinally and non-invasively characterize both the sciatic nerve crush and 
      lysolecithin (LCP) demyelination models of peripheral nerve injury in rodents. 
      Electrophysiological, gene expression and histological assessments complemented the 
      extensive MRI analyses in young and aged animals. In the nerve crush model, MTR 
      analysis indicated a slower recovery in regions distal to the site of injury in aged 
      animals, as well as incomplete recovery at six weeks post-crush when analyzing 
      across the entire nerve surface. Similar regional impairments were also found in the 
      LCP demyelination model. This research underlines the power of MTR for the study of 
      peripheral nerve injury in small tissues such as the sciatic nerve of rodents and 
      contributes new knowledge to the effect of aging on recovery after injury. A 
      particular advantage of the approach is the translational potential to human 
      neuropathies.

TI  - Magnetization Transfer Ratio in Peripheral Nerve Tissue: Does It Depend on Age or 
      Location?
PG  - 397-402
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000455 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetization transfer contrast imaging provides indirect 
      information on the concentration of "bound" water protons and their interactions 
      with "free" water molecules. The purpose of this study is to analyze location- and 
      age-dependent changes in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of lower extremity 
      nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten younger (20-32 years) and 5 older (50-63 years) 
      healthy volunteers underwent magnetization transfer contrast imaging at 3 Tesla Two 
      3-dimensional gradient echo sequences with and without an off-resonance saturation 
      pulse (repetition time: 58 milliseconds; echo time: 2.46 milliseconds; band width: 
      530 Hz/Px; flip angle: α = 7°) were acquired at 3 different locations covering the 
      proximal thigh to the distal lower leg in the group of younger volunteers and at 2 
      different locations covering the proximal to distal thigh in the group of older 
      volunteers. Sciatic and tibial nerve regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn 
      and additional ROIs were placed in predetermined muscles. Magnetization transfer 
      ratios were extracted from respective ROIs and calculated for each individual and 
      location. RESULTS: In young volunteers, mean values of nerve and muscle MTR were not 
      different between the proximal thigh (nerve: 20.34 ± 0.91; muscle: 31.71 ± 0.29), 
      distal thigh (nerve: 19.90 ± 0.98; P = 0.76; muscle: 31.53 ± 0.69; P = 0.87), and 
      lower leg (nerve: 20.82 ± 1.07; P = 0.73; muscle: 32.44 ± 1.11; P = 0.51). An 
      age-dependent decrease of sciatic nerve MTR was observed in the group of older 
      volunteers (16.95 ± 1.2) compared with the group of younger volunteers (20.12 ± 
      0.65; P = 0.019). Differences in muscle MTR were not significant between older 
      (31.01 ± 0.49) and younger (31.62 ± 0.37; P = 0.20) volunteers. CONCLUSION: The MTR 
      of lower extremity nerves shows no proximal-to-distal gradient in young healthy 
      volunteers but decreases with age. For future studies using MTR in peripheral nerve 
      disorders, these findings suggest that referencing magnetization transfer contrast 
      values in terms of age, but not anatomical nerve location is required.

AB  - This chapter summarizes progress in the evaluation of peripheral nerve (PN) lesions 
      and disorders by imaging techniques encompassing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      and nerve ultrasound (US). Due to the radiation exposure and limited sensitivity in 
      soft tissue contrast, computed-tomography (CT) plays no significant role in the 
      diagnostic work-up of PN disorders. MRI and US are complementary techniques for the 
      evaluation of peripheral nerves, each having particular advantages and 
      disadvantages. Nerve injury induces intrinsic MRI signal alterations on T2-weighted 
      sequences in degenerating or demyelinating nerve segments as well as in 
      corresponding muscle groups exhibiting denervation which can be exploited 
      diagnostically. Nerve US is based on changes in the nerve echotexture due to tumor 
      formation or focal enlargement caused by entrapment or inflammation. Both MRI and US 
      provide morphological information on the precise site and extent of nerve injury. 
      While US has the advantage of easy accessibility, providing images with superior 
      spatial resolution at low cost, MRI shows better soft tissue contrast and better 
      image quality for deep-lying nerve structures since imaging is not hindered by bone. 
      Recent advances have remarkably increased spatial resolution of both MRI and US 
      making imaging indispensible for the elucidation of causes of nerve compression, 
      peripheral nerve tumors, and focal inflammatory conditions. Both MRI and US further 
      guide neurosurgical exploration and can simplify treatment. Importantly, imaging can 
      reveal treatable conditions even in the absence of gross electrophysiological 
      alterations, illustrating its increasing role in clinical practice. In experimental 
      settings, novel molecular and cellular MRI contrast agents allow in-vivo assessment 
      of nerve regeneration as well as monitoring of neuroinflammation. Depending on 
      further clinical development, contrast-enhanced MRI has the potential to follow 
      cellular responses over time in vivo and to overcome the current limitations of 
      histological assessment of nerve afflictions. Further advances in contrast-enhanced 
      US has the potential for developing into a tool for the assessment of nerve blood 
      perfusion, paving the way for better assessments of ischemic neuropathies.

TI  - Presence of time-dependent diffusion in the brachial plexus.
PG  - 789-795
LID - 10.1002/mrm.26733 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This work describes the development of a method to measure the variation of 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with diffusion time (Δ) in the brachial plexus, 
      as a potential method of probing microstructure. METHODS: Diffusion-weighted MRI 
      with body signal suppression was used to highlight the nerves from surrounding 
      tissues, and sequence parameters were optimized for sensitivity to change with 
      diffusion time. A porous media-restricted diffusion model based on the Latour-Mitra 
      equation was fitted to the diffusion time-dependent ADC data from the brachial 
      plexus nerves and cord. RESULTS: The ADC was observed to reduce at long diffusion 
      times, confirming that diffusion was restricted in the nerves and cord in healthy 
      subjects. T2 of the nerves was measured to be 80 ± 5 ms, the diffusion coefficient 
      was found to vary from (1.5 ± 0.1) × 10(-3) mm(2) /s at a diffusion time of 18.3 ms 
      to (1.0 ± 0.2) × 10(-3) mm(2) /s at a diffusion time of 81.3 ms. CONCLUSION: A novel 
      method of probing restricted diffusion in the brachial plexus was developed. 
      Resulting parameters were comparable with values obtained previously on biological 
      systems. Magn Reson Med 79:789-795, 2018. © 2017 International Society for Magnetic

TI  - MRI detects peripheral nerve and adjacent muscle pathology in non-systemic 
      vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN).
PG  - 975-981
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09224-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and disease monitoring of non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy 
      (NSVN) are based on electrophysiological and clinical measures. However, these 
      methods are insensitive to detect subtle differences of axonal injury. We here 
      assessed the utility of a multiparametric MRI protocol to quantify axonal injury and 
      neurogenic muscle damage in NSVN. METHODS: Ten NSVN patients and ten age-matched 
      controls were investigated in this single-center prospective study. All participants 
      were assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the tibial nerve and multiecho 
      Dixon MRI of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. These data were correlated with 
      clinical and electrophysiological data. RESULTS: DTI scans of the tibial nerves of 
      patients with NSVN showed significantly lower mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values 
      (0.32 ± 0.02) compared to healthy controls (0.42 ± 0.01). FA values of NSVN patients 
      correlated negatively with clinical measures of pain. Multiecho Dixon MRI scans 
      revealed significantly higher intramuscular fat fractions in the soleus muscle 
      (19.86 ± 6.18% vs. 5.86 ± 0.74%, p = 0.0015) and gastrocnemius muscle (26.09 ± 6.21% 
      vs. 3.59 ± 0.82%, p = 0.0002) in NSVN patients compared to healthy controls. 
      CONCLUSION: Our data provide a proof of concept that MRI can render information 
      about nerve integrity and muscle pathology in NSVN. Further studies are warranted to 
      evaluate DTI and multiecho Dixon MRI as surrogate markers in NSVN.

AB  - Imaging studies of peripheral nerves have increased considerably in the last ten 
      years. In addition to the classical and still valid study by ultrasound, new 
      neurographic techniques developed from conventional morphological sequences 
      (including 3D isotropic studies with fat suppression) are making it possible to 
      assess different peripheral nerves and plexuses, including small sensory and/or 
      motor branches, with great precision. Diffusion-weighted sequences and diffusion 
      tensor imaging have opened a new horizon in neurographic studies. This new approach 
      provides morphological and functional information about the internal structure and 
      pathophysiology of the peripheral nerves and diseases that involve them. This update 
      reviews the different MR neurography techniques available for the study of the 
      peripheral nerves, with special emphasis on new sequences based on diffusion.

TI  - Medial axis segmentation of cranial nerves using shape statistics-aware discrete 
      deformable models.
PG  - 1955-1967
LID - 10.1007/s11548-019-02014-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We propose a segmentation methodology for brainstem cranial nerves using 
      statistical shape model (SSM)-based deformable 3D contours from T(2) MR images. 
      METHODS: We create shape models for ten pairs of cranial nerves. High-resolution 
      T(2) MR images are segmented for nerve centerline using a 1-Simplex discrete 
      deformable 3D contour model. These segmented centerlines comprise training datasets 
      for the shape model. Point correspondence for the training dataset is performed 
      using an entropy-based energy minimization framework applied to particles located on 
      the centerline curve. The shape information is incorporated into the 1-Simplex model 
      by introducing a shape-based internal force, making the deformation stable against 
      low resolution and image artifacts. RESULTS: The proposed method is validated 
      through extensive experiments using both synthetic and patient MRI data. The 
      robustness and stability of the proposed method are experimented using synthetic 
      datasets. SSMs are constructed independently for ten pairs (CNIII-CNXII) of 
      brainstem cranial nerves using ten non-pathological image datasets of the brainstem. 
      The constructed ten SSMs are assessed in terms of compactness, specificity and 
      generality. In order to quantify the error distances between segmented results and 
      ground truths, two metrics are used: mean absolute shape distance (MASD) and 
      Hausdorff distance (HD). MASD error using the proposed shape model is 0.19 ± 0.13 
      (mean ± std. deviation) mm and HD is 0.21 mm which are sub-voxel accuracy given the 
      input image resolution. CONCLUSION: This paper described a probabilistic digital 
      atlas of the ten brainstem-attached cranial nerve pairs by incorporating a 
      statistical shape model with the 1-Simplex deformable contour. The integration of 
      shape information as a priori knowledge results in robust and accurate centerline 
      segmentations from even low-resolution MRI data, which is essential in neurosurgical 
      planning and simulations for accurate and robust 3D patient-specific models of 
      critical tissues including cranial nerves.

TI  - MRI of the Carpal Tunnel 3 and 12 Months After Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel Release.
PG  - 464-470
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.23066 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to study changes in the median nerve, 
      retinaculum, and carpal tunnel on MRI after successful endoscopic carpal tunnel 
      release (ECTR). SUBJECTS AND METHODS. In this prospective study, 35 wrists in 32 
      patients (five men, 27 women; mean age, 56.7 ± 6.8 [SD] years) with nerve conduction 
      test-confirmed primary carpal tunnel syndrome were evaluated from May 2013 to 
      September 2016. Clinical scores ranging from 0 to 4 (no improvement to symptoms 
      completely resolved) and MRI morphologic features of median nerve and carpal tunnel 
      were evaluated at baseline and 3 and 12 months after ECTR. The paired t test was 
      used to compare MRI parameters before and after ECTR and their relationships to 
      clinical improvement scores. RESULTS. All patients' conditions improved after ECTR 
      with mean clinical improvement scores of 2.94 ± 1.0 at 3 months and 3.49 ± 0.56 at 
      12 months. Although median nerve swelling did decrease proximally, the nerve 
      remained swollen (> 15 mm(2)) and flattened in all areas, even 12 months after ECTR. 
      Additional changes occurred in median nerve caliber-change ratio, relative signal 
      intensity, and carpal tunnel cross-sectional area. A retinacular gap was present in 
      33 (94%) wrists 3 months and six (17%) wrists 12 months after ECTR, and increased 
      retinacular bowing persisted. CONCLUSION. After ECTR, undue swelling and flattening 
      of the median nerve persist as long as 12 months after surgery, even in patients 
      with a good surgical outcome. One should be wary of using these MRI findings as 
      signs of persistent neural compression. The retinaculum reforms in most patients 
      within 12 months of surgery but with a more bowed configuration.

AB  - Nerve regeneration after injury must occur in a timely fashion to restore function. 
      Unfortunately, current methods (e.g., electrophysiology) provide limited information 
      following trauma, resulting in delayed management and suboptimal outcomes. Herein, 
      we evaluated the ability of diffusion MRI to monitor nerve regeneration after 
      injury/repair. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three treatment groups 
      (sham = 21, crush = 23, cut/repair = 19) and ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was performed 1-12 weeks post-surgery. 
      Behavioral data showed a distinction between crush and cut/repair nerves at 4 weeks. 
      This was consistent with DTI, which found that thresholds based on the ratio of 
      radial and axial diffusivities (RD/AD = 0.40 ± 0.02) and fractional anisotropy 
      (FA = 0.53 ± 0.01) differentiated crush from cut/repair injuries. By the 12(th) 
      week, cut/repair nerves whose behavioral data indicated a partial recovery were 
      below the RD/AD threshold (and above the FA threshold), while nerves that did not 
      recover were on the opposite side of each threshold. Additional morphometric 
      analysis indicated that DTI-derived normalized scalar indices report on axon density 
      (RD/AD: r = -0.54, p < 1e-3; FA: r = 0.56, p < 1e-3). Interestingly, higher-order 
      DKI analyses did not improve our ability classify recovery. These findings suggest 
      that DTI may provide promising biomarkers for distinguishing successful/unsuccessful 
      nerve repairs and potentially identify cases that require reoperation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether cochlear nerve (CN) cross-sectional area as measured 
      with parasagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in prelingual pediatric deaf 
      patients correlates with auditory performance after cochlear implantation. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Prospective Cohort study. METHODS: Thirty-two prelingual children with 
      bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) who received unilateral 
      cochlear implant were included in this study. Diameters of CN at Internal auditory 
      canal (IAC) fundus and mid-point of IAC were retrospectively measured on 
      parasagittal images of FIESTA (Fast Imaging Employing Steady-state Acquisition) 
      sequence MRI by two independent observers. Cross-sectional areas [π (Height/2) 
      (Width/2)] were then correlated with post-operative CAPS (Categories of Auditory 
      Performance) and IT-MAIS (Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale) 
      scores regularly assessed at 3 monthly intervals post device activation. RESULTS: 
      The cochlear nerve was identified in all the 32 patients. Mean cross-sectional areas 
      (CSA) of cochlear nerve were 0.71 ± 0.16 mm(2) at IAC fundus and 
      0.73 ± 0.18 mm(2) at mid-point of IAC. The correlation value between CSA at 
      mid-point of IAC and CAPS score at 6 months was 0.271 (p-value- 0.140) and 
      correlation value between CSA at mid-point of IAC and IT-MAIS score at 6 months was 
      0.282 (p-value- 0.124) which were statistically not significant. CONCLUSION: There 
      was no significant correlation between the cross-sectional areas of the cochlear 
      nerve on MRI and postoperative auditory scores as measured by CAPS and IT-MAIS 
      scores at six months from the device activation. Hence, we conclude that above an 
      adequate diameter, which can affect the minimum required neurons, the changes in the 
      diameter do not have significant bearing on auditory outcomes after cochlear 
      implantation.

AB  - We sought to assess the utility of simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography 
      with the nerve-sheath signal increased by inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of 
      relaxation-enhancement imaging (SHINKEI-Quant) for the quantitative evaluation of 
      compressed nerves in patients with lumbar radiculopathy. Thirty-two patients with 
      lumbar radiculopathy and 5 healthy subjects underwent simultaneous apparent T2 
      mapping and neurography with SHINKEI-Quant. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed 
      in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal nerves distal to the lumbar 
      nerves bilaterally at L4-S1. The T2 relaxation times were measured on the affected 
      and unaffected sides. The T2 ratio was calculated as the affected side/unaffected 
      side. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the correlation 
      between the T2 relaxation times or T2 ratio and clinical symptoms. An ROC curve was 
      used to examine the diagnostic accuracy and threshold of the T2 relaxation times and 
      T2 ratio. We observed no significant differences in the T2 relaxation times between 
      the nerve roots on the left and right at each spinal level in healthy subjects. In 
      patients, lumbar neurography revealed swelling of the involved nerve, and prolonged 
      T2 relaxation times compared with that of the contralateral nerve. The T2 ratio 
      correlated with leg pain. The ROC analysis revealed that the T2 relaxation time 
      threshold was 127 ms and the T2 ratio threshold was 1.07. To our knowledge, this is 
      the first study to show the utility of SHINKEI-Quant for the quantitative evaluation 
      of lumbar radiculopathy.

TI  - Microstructural Integrity of Peripheral Nerves in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease: An 
      MRI Evaluation Study.
PG  - 437-444
LID - 10.1002/jmri.27354 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is diagnosed through clinical findings 
      and genetic testing. While there are neurophysiological tools and clinical 
      functional scales in CMT, objective disease biomarkers that can facilitate in 
      monitoring disease progression are limited. PURPOSE: To investigate the utility of 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in determining the microstructural integrity of 
      sciatic and peroneal nerves and its correlation with the MRI grading of muscle 
      atrophy severity and clinical function in CMT as determined by the CMT neuropathy 
      score (CMTNS). STUDY TYPE: Prospective case-control. SUBJECTS: Nine CMT patients and 
      nine age-matched controls. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3 T T(1) -weighted in-/out-of 
      phase spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) and DTI sequences. ASSESSMENT: 
      Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and 
      mean diffusivity (MD) values for sciatic and peroneal nerves were obtained from DTI. 
      Muscle atrophy was graded according to the Goutallier classification using 
      in-/out-of phase SPGRs. DTI parameters and muscle atrophy grades were compared 
      between CMT and controls, and the relationship between DTI parameters, muscle 
      atrophy grades, and CMTNS were assessed. STATISTICAL TESTS: The Wilcoxon Signed 
      Ranks test was used to compare DTI parameters between CMT and controls. The 
      relationship between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS were analyzed 
      using the Spearman correlation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of 
      DTI parameters that can differentiate CMT from healthy controls were done. RESULTS: 
      There was a significant reduction in FA and increase in RD of both nerves (P < 0.05) 
      in CMT, with significant correlations between FA (negative; P < 0.05) and RD 
      (positive; P < 0.05) with muscle atrophy grade. In the sciatic nerve, there was 
      significant correlation between FA and CMTNS (r = -0.795; P < 0.05). FA and RD could 
      discriminate CMT from controls with high sensitivity (77.8-100%) and specificity 
      (88.9-100%). DATA CONCLUSION: There were significant differences of DTI parameters 
      between CMT and controls, with significant correlations between DTI parameters, 
      muscle atrophy grade, and CMTNS. Level of Evidence 2 Technical Efficacy Stage 2 J.

AB  - Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) has been used extensively to study pathological 
      conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, tissue damage is 
      assessed qualitatively with little information regarding the underlying 
      pathophysiological processes involved. Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) is a 
      quantitative magnetic resonance imaging method which is sensitive to tissue 
      macromolecular content and may therefore have an important role in the study of 
      pathologies affecting the PNS. This study explored the feasibility of obtaining 
      reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus of healthy volunteers using 
      MRN to identify and segment each lumbar segment (L2-L5) and regions (preganglionic, 
      ganglionic and postganglionic). Reproducibility of the MTR measurements and of the 
      segmentation method were assessed from repeated measurements (scan-rescan), and from 
      the reanalysis of images (intra- and inter-rater assessment), by calculating the 
      coefficient of variation (COV). In all segments combined (L2-L5), mean (± SD) MTR 
      was 30.5 (± 2.4). Scan-rescan, intra- and inter-rater COV values were 3.2%, 4.4% and 
      5.3%, respectively. One-way analysis of variance revealed a statistically 
      significant difference in MTR between the preganglionic and postganglionic regions 
      in all lumbar segments. This pilot study in healthy volunteers demonstrates the 
      feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus, 
      opening up the possibility of studying a broad spectrum of neurological conditions 
      in vivo.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis 
      (MS) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). METHODS: Thirty-six patients diagnosed 
      with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing-remitting form, 2 
      with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease-modifying treatment were 
      compared to 35 healthy age-/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed 
      neurological and electrophysiological examinations. Three Tesla MRN with large 
      anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 
      2-dimensional (2D) fat-saturated, T2-weighted (T2w) and dual echo turbo spin echo 
      sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides 
      qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w signal quantification was performed by 
      calculation of proton spin density and T2 relaxation time. Nerve diameter was 
      measured as a morphometric criterion. RESULTS: T2w hyperintense nerve lesions were 
      detectable in all MS patients, with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 
      151.5 ± 5.7 versus 19.1 ± 2.4 in controls (p < 0.0001). Nerve proton spin density 
      was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8 ± 7.7/368.9 ± 8.2) versus controls 
      (tibial/peroneal: 266.0 ± 11.0/276.8 ± 9.7, p < 0.0001). In contrast, T2 relaxation 
      time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal: 82.0 ± 2.1/78.3 ± 1.7) 
      versus MS (tibial/peroneal: 64.3 ± 1.0/61.2 ± 0.9, p < 0.0001). Proximal tibial and 
      peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial: 52.4 ± 2.1mm(2) , peroneal: 
      25.4 ± 1.3mm(2) ) versus controls (tibial: 45.2 ± 1.4mm(2) , p < 0.0015; peroneal: 
      21.3 ± 0.7mm(2) , p = 0.0049). INTERPRETATION: Peripheral nerve lesions could be 
      visualized and quantified in MS in vivo by high-resolution MRN. Lesions are defined 
      by an increase of proton spin density and a decrease of T2 relaxation time, 
      indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix 
      in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous 
      system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the 
      pathophysiology and treatment of MS. Ann Neurol 2017;82:676-685.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation between 
      neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) germline mutations and imaging features of neurofibromas 
      on whole-body MRI (WBMRI) by using radiomics image analysis techniques. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with NF1 who had known germline mutations 
      determined by targeted next-generation sequencing were selected from a previous 
      WBMRI study using coronal short tau inversion recovery sequence. Each tumor was 
      segmented in WBMRI and a set of 59 imaging features was calculated using our 
      in-house volumetric image analysis platform, 3DQI. A radiomics heatmap of 59 imaging 
      features was analyzed to investigate the per-tumor and per-patient associations 
      between the imaging features and mutation domains and mutation types. Linear 
      mixed-effect models and one-way analysis of variance tests were performed to assess 
      the similarity of tumor imaging features within mutation groups, between mutation 
      groups, and between randomly selected groups. RESULTS: A total of 218 neurofibromas 
      (97 discrete neurofibromas and 121 plexiform neurofibromas) were identified in 19 of 
      the 29 patients. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering in heatmap analysis 
      revealed 6 major image feature patterns that were significantly correlated with gene 
      mutation domains and types with strong to very strong associations of 
      genotype-phenotype correlations in both per-tumor and per-patient studies (p < 0.05, 
      Cramer V > 0.5), whereas tumor size and locations showed no correlations with 
      imaging features (p = 0.79 and p = 0.42, respectively). The statistical analyses 
      revealed that the number of significantly different features (SDFs) within mutation 
      groups were significantly lower than those between mutation groups (mutation 
      domains: 10.9 ± 9.5% vs 31.9 ± 23.8% and mutation types: 31.8 ± 30.7% vs 52.6 ± 
      29.3%). The first and second quartile p values of within-patient groups were more 
      than 2 times higher than those between-patient groups. However, the numbers of SDFs 
      between randomly selected groups were much lower (approximately 5.2%). CONCLUSION: 
      This preliminary study identified the NF1 radiogenomics linkage between NF1 
      causative mutations and MRI radiomic features, i.e., the correlation between NF1 
      genotype and imaging phenotype on WBMRI.

TI  - Optic nerve sheath diameter sonography for the diagnosis of increased intracranial 
      pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.
PG  - e016194

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a significant neurological 
      issue that may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. When evaluating patients 
      with traumatic brain injury, it is crucial to identify those with high ICP in order 
      to expedite ICP lowering measures and maintain adequate cerebral perfusion. Several 
      measures are used to recognise patients with increased ICP including CT scan, MRI, 
      ICP monitor, and lumbar puncture (LP). However, these tests can be invasive, 
      associated with radiation exposure, contraindicated, or not readily available. 
      Ultrasonography measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is proposed as 
      a non-invasive and quick measure to identify high ICP. The aim of this systematic 
      review and meta-analysis will be to examine the accuracy of ONSD sonography for 
      increased ICP diagnosis. METHODS AND ANALYSES: We will include published and 
      unpublished randomised controlled trials, observational studies, and abstracts, with 
      no publication type or language restrictions. Search strategies will be designed to 
      peruse the MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, WHO Clinical Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library databases. We will also implement strategies to 
      search grey literature. Two reviewers will independently complete data abstraction 
      and conduct quality assessment. Included studies will be assessed using the Quality 
      Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. We will construct the 
      hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve for included studies 
      and pool sensitivity and specificity using the bivariate model. We also plan to 
      conduct prespecified subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity. The overall quality

TI  - Peripheral nerve imaging: Not only cross-sectional area.
PG  - 726-8
LID - 10.4329/wjr.v8.i8.726 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral nerve imaging is recognized as a complement to clinical and 
      neurophysiological assessment in the evaluation of peripheral nerves with the 
      ability to impact patient management, even for small and difficult nerves. The 
      European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, suggest to use ultrasound (US) for 
      nerve evaluation due to the fact that, in sever anatomical area, magnetic resonance 
      imaging is not able to give additional informations. US could be considered the 
      first-choice approach for the assessment of peripheral nerves. The relative drawback 
      of peripheral nerve US is the long learning curve and the deep anatomic competence 
      to evaluate even small nerves. In the recent years, the role of US in peripheral 
      nerve evaluation has been widened. In the past, nerve US was mainly used to assess 
      nerve-cross sectional area, but now more advanced measurements and considerations 
      are desirable and can boost the role of peripheral nerve US. Nerve echotexture 
      evaluation was defined in 2010: The ratio between the hypoechoic and hyperechoic 
      areas of peripheral nerves on US was called "nerve density". For evaluation of 
      patients who have peripheral neuropathies, the role of peripheral nerve is US wider 
      than simple cross-sectional area evaluation. Quantitative measurements describing 
      the internal fascicular echotexture of peripheral nerves introduce the concept of 
      considering US as a possible quantitative imaging biomarker technique. The potential 
      of nerve US has started to be uncovered. It seems clear that only cross-sectional 
      area measurement is no more sufficient for a comprehensive US evaluation of 
      peripheral nerves.

TI  - Cross-sectional Area Just Proximal to the Carpal Tunnel According to the Ulnar 
      Variances: Positive Ulnar Variance and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
PG  - 76-81
LID - 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001640 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the relationship between the area around the distal radioulnar 
      joint according to the ulnar variances and the cross-sectional area using magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans in this prospective study of patients with carpal 
      tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: From among a total of 243 patients who had been 
      diagnosed with CTS between March 2012 and February 2017 at our hospital, 41 patients 
      with positive ulnar variance were enrolled in group 1. As control groups, 39 healthy 
      volunteers who underwent MRI evaluations were included in group 2 (neutral ulnar 
      variance) and group 3 (negative variance). Basic demographic data, including age, 
      sex, and body mass index, were recorded for all 3 groups. An area encompassing the 
      contents of carpal tunnel (nerves/tendons) was designated as area "A," and the area 
      just beneath the subcutaneous fat was designated as area "B" at the levels of the 
      lunate (L) and pisiform (P) on axial MRI. Ratios of these areas ("A/B at L" and "A/B 
      at P") were evaluated in terms of their correlations with ulnar variance. RESULTS: 
      Mean age, sex, and body mass index were not statistically different among the 
      groups, respectively. Within each group, there was no difference between "A/B at L" 
      and "A/B at P," respectively. When comparing the 3 groups, "A/B at L" and "A/B at P" 
      were all significantly decreased in group 1 than in other groups. Regardless of the 
      group, ulnar length negatively correlated with both "A/B at L" and "A/B at P" 
      ratios. CONCLUSIONS: We found a positive relationship between decreased 
      cross-sectional area around the distal radioulnar joint and positive ulnar variance 
      on radiologic investigation. These findings show the importance of variance in the 
      positive ulna variance to the development of CTS.

TI  - MRI-based assessment of function and dysfunction in myelinated axons.
PG  - E10225-E10234
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1801788115 [doi]
AB  - Repetitive electrical activity produces microstructural alteration in myelinated 
      axons, which may afford the opportunity to noninvasively monitor function of 
      myelinated fibers in peripheral nervous system (PNS)/CNS pathways. Microstructural 
      changes were assessed via two different magnetic-resonance-based approaches: 
      diffusion fMRI and dynamic T(2) spectroscopy in the ex vivo perfused bullfrog 
      sciatic nerves. Using this robust, classical model as a platform for testing, we 
      demonstrate that noninvasive diffusion fMRI, based on standard diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI), can clearly localize the sites of axonal conduction blockage as might 
      be encountered in neurotrauma or other lesion types. It is also shown that the 
      diffusion fMRI response is graded in proportion to the total number of electrical 
      impulses carried through a given locus. Dynamic T(2) spectroscopy of the perfused 
      frog nerves point to an electrical-activity-induced redistribution of tissue water 
      and myelin structural changes. Diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) reveals a 
      reversible shift of tissue water into a restricted isotropic diffusion signal 
      component. Submyelinic vacuoles are observed in electron-microscopy images of tissue 
      fixed during electrical stimulation. A slowing of the compound action potential 
      conduction velocity accompanies repetitive electrical activity. Correlations between 
      electrophysiology and MRI parameters during and immediately after stimulation are 
      presented. Potential mechanisms and interpretations of these results are discussed.

      sequences.
PG  - 1334-1369
LID - 10.21037/qims-20-568 [doi]
AB  - The group of Multiplied, Added, Subtracted and/or fiTted Inversion Recovery (MASTIR) 
      pulse sequences in which usually two or more inversion recovery (IR) images of 
      different types are combined is described, and uses for this type of sequence are 
      outlined. IR sequences of different types can be multiplied, added, subtracted, 
      and/or fitted together to produce variants of the MASTIR sequence. The sequences 
      provide a range of options for increasing image contrast, demonstrating specific 
      tissues and fluids of interest, and suppressing unwanted signals. A formalism using 
      the concept of pulse sequences as tissue property filters is used to explain the 
      signal, contrast and weighting of the pulse sequences with both univariate and 
      multivariate filter models. Subtraction of one magnitude reconstructed IR image from 
      another with a shorter TI can produce very high T(1) dependent positive contrast 
      from small increases in T(1). The reverse subtracted IR sequence can provide high 
      positive contrast enhancement with gadolinium chelates and iron deposition which 
      decrease T(1). Additional contrast to that arising from increases in T(1) can be 
      produced by supplementing this with contrast arising from concurrent increases in 
      ρ(m) and T(2), as well as increases or decreases in diffusion using subtraction IR 
      with echo subtraction and/or diffusion subtraction. Phase images may show 180º 
      differences as a result of rotating into the transverse plane both positive and 
      negative longitudinal magnetization. Phase images with contrast arising in this way, 
      or other ways, can be multiplied by magnitude IR images to increase the contrast of 
      the latter. Magnetization Transfer (MT) and susceptibility can be used with IR 
      sequences to improve contrast. Selective images of white and brown adipose tissue 
      lipid and water components can be produced using different TIs and in and 
      out-of-phase TEs. Selective images of ultrashort and short T(2) tissue components 
      can be produced by nulling long T(2) tissue components with an inversion pulse and 
      subtraction of images with longer TEs from images with ultrashort TEs. The Double 
      Echo Sliding IR (DESIRE) sequence provides images with a wide range of TIs from 
      which it is possible to choose values of TI to achieve particular types of tissue 
      and/or fluid contrast (e.g., for subtraction with different TIs, as described above, 
      and for long T(2) tissue signal nulling with UTE sequences). Unwanted tissue and 
      fluid signals can be suppressed by addition and subtraction of phase-sensitive (ps) 
      and magnitude reconstructed images. The sequence also offers options for synergistic 
      use of the changes in blood and tissue ρ(m), T(1), T(2)/T(2)*, D* and perfusion that 
      can be seen with fMRI of the brain. In-vivo and ex-vivo illustrative examples of 
      normal brain, cartilage, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and peripheral 
      nerve imaged with different forms of the MASTIR sequence are included.

AB  - Diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies relies on neurological examinations, 
      electrodiagnostic studies, and since recently magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). 
      The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a fully-automatic segmentation 
      method of peripheral nerves of the thigh. T2-weighted sequences without fat 
      suppression acquired on a 3 T MR scanner were retrospectively analyzed in 10 healthy 
      volunteers and 42 patients suffering from clinically and electrophysiologically 
      diagnosed sciatic neuropathy. A fully-convolutional neural network was developed to 
      segment the MRN images into peripheral nerve and background tissues. The performance 
      of the method was compared to manual inter-rater segmentation variability. The 
      proposed method yielded Dice coefficients of 0.859 ± 0.061 and 0.719 ± 0.128, 
      Hausdorff distances of 13.9 ± 26.6 and 12.4 ± 12.1 mm, and volumetric similarities 
      of 0.930 ± 0.054 and 0.897 ± 0.109, for the healthy volunteer and patient cohorts, 
      respectively. The complete segmentation process requires less than one second, which 
      is a significant decrease to manual segmentation with an average duration of 19 ± 8 
      min. Considering cross-sectional area or signal intensity of the segmented nerves, 
      focal and extended lesions might be detected. Such analyses could be used as 
      biomarker for lesion burden, or serve as volume of interest for further quantitative 
      MRN techniques. We demonstrated that fully-automatic segmentation of healthy and 
      neuropathic sciatic nerves can be performed from standard MRN images with good 
      accuracy and in a clinically feasible time.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study optic disc in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with 
      diffusion tensor imaging. METHODS: Prospective study was carried out on 31 
      consecutive patients with IIH and 17 age and sex-matched controls that underwent 
      diffusion tensor imaging of optic nerve. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean 
      diffusivity (MD) of optic disc were measured by two readers. Grades of papilledema 
      and visual field defects were evaluated by ophthalmologist. RESULTS: FA of optic 
      disc was significantly lower in IIH than controls (p = 0.001) with excellent 
      inter-observer agreement (K = 0.93) of both readers. The cutoff FA used to 
      differentiating IIH from controls were 0.28 and 0.29 with area under curve (AUC) of 
      0.921 and 0.914, accuracy 92% and 91%, and sensitivity 97% and 96%. MD of optic disc 
      were significantly higher in IIH than in controls (p = 0.001) with excellent 
      inter-observer agreement (K = 0.91) of both readers. The cutoff MD used to 
      differentiating IIH from controls was 1.51 and 1.22 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s with AUC 0.943 
      and 0.922, and accuracy 94% and 92% respectively. FA of optic disc was significantly 
      lower in early than advanced papilledema and visual field defects (p = 0.001, 0.001) 
      respectively. The MD of optic disc was significantly higher in early than advanced 
      papilledema and visual field defects (p = 0.001, 0.001) respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Diffusion tensor imaging parameters of optic disc are non-invasive reliable imaging 
      parameters that can be used for diagnosis of IIH and well correlated with 
      papilledema and visual field defects.

AB  - Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows the directional dependence 
      of water diffusion to be studied. Analysis of the resulting image data allows for 
      the determination of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC), as well as allowing three-dimensional visualization of the fiber tract 
      (tractography). We visualized the ulnar nerve of ten healthy volunteers with DTI. We 
      found FA to be 0.752 ± 0.067 and the ADC to be 0.96 ± 0.13 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s. A 
      nuts-and-bolts description of the physical aspects of DTI is provided as an 
      educational process for readers.

TI  - Differentiation of peripheral nerve sheath tumors in patients with neurofibromatosis 
      type 1 using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 508-516
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/noy199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the value of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) for characterization of benign and malignant peripheral 
      nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). 
      METHODS: Twenty-six patients with NF1 and suspicion of malignant transformation of 
      PNSTs were prospectively enrolled and underwent DW MRI at 3T. For a set of benign (n 
      = 55) and malignant (n = 12) PNSTs, functional MRI parameters were derived from both 
      biexponential intravoxel incoherent motion (diffusion coefficient D and perfusion 
      fraction f) and monoexponential data analysis (apparent diffusion coefficients 
      [ADCs]). A panel of morphological MRI features was evaluated using T1- and 
      T2-weighted imaging. Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher's exact test, and receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to assess the diagnostic 
      accuracy of quantitative and qualitative MRI. Cohen's kappa was used to determine 
      interrater reliability. RESULTS: Malignant PNSTs demonstrated significantly lower 
      diffusivity (P < 0.0001) compared with benign PNSTs. The perfusion fraction f was 
      significantly higher in malignant PNSTs (P < 0.001). In ROC analysis, functional MRI 
      parameters showed high diagnostic accuracy for differentiation of PNSTs (eg, 
      ADCmean, 92% sensitivity with 98% specificity, AUC 0.98; Dmean, 92% sensitivity with 
      98% specificity, AUC 0.98). By contrast, morphological imaging features had only 
      limited sensitivity (18-94%) and specificity (18-82%) for identification of 
      malignancy. Interrater reliability was higher for monoexponential data analysis. 
      CONCLUSION: DW imaging shows better diagnostic performance than morphological 
      features and allows accurate differentiation of benign and malignant peripheral 
      nerve sheath tumors in NF1.

AB  - Recent developments in the field of peripheral nerve imaging extend the capabilities 
      of imaging modalities to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with 
      peripheral nerve maladies. Methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its 
      derivative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), ultrasound (US) and positron emission 
      tomography (PET) are capable of assessing nerve structure and function following 
      injury and relating the state of the nerve to electrophysiological and histological 
      analysis. Of the imaging methods surveyed here, each offered unique and interesting 
      advantages related to the field. MRI offered the opportunity to visualize immune 
      activity on the injured nerve throughout the course of the regeneration process, and 
      DTI offered numerical characterization of the injury and the ability to develop 
      statistical bases for diagnosing injury. US extends imaging to the treatment phase 
      by enabling more precise analgesic applications following surgery, and PET 
      represents a novel method of assessing nerve injury through analysis of relative 
      metabolism rates in injured and healthy tissue. Exciting new possibilities to 
      enhance and extend the abilities of imaging methods are also discussed, including 
      innovative contrast agents, some of which enable multimodal imaging approaches and 
      present opportunities for treatment application.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies demonstrated that soft tissues, such as retinaculum, 
      fibrous band, and anconeus, cause ulnar nerve compression, whereas other studies 
      showed that the bony structures strain the ulnar nerve that runs directly behind the 
      medial epicondyle constituting the boundary of the cubital tunnel during elbow 
      flexion. However, no studies have reported the association of the shape of the bony 
      structure with cubital tunnel syndrome symptoms. Are computed tomography (CT) and 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-measured parameters of the bony cubital tunnel 
      related to idiopathic cubital tunnel syndrome symptoms? HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized 
      that CT and MRI-measured parameters of the bony cubital tunnel were related to 
      idiopathic cubital tunnel syndrome symptoms. We aimed to investigate the 
      relationship between the radiographic parameters based on CT and MRI and idiopathic 
      cubital tunnel syndrome symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 224 elbows (77 
      affected elbows of patients with idiopathic cubital tunnel syndrome, 77 unaffected 
      elbows of patients with cubital tunnel syndrome, 70 elbows of patients without 
      cubital tunnel syndrome symptoms) using CT and MRI. Cubital tunnel cross-sectional 
      area, cubital tunnel volume, and ulnar nerve cross-sectional area were measured in 
      the three groups at flexion and extension. A new cubital tunnel center with a new 
      boundary was proposed that could play a role in ulnar nerve compression symptoms. 
      RESULTS: The cross-sectional areas and volumes of the cubital tunnel measured in the 
      elbow flexion state were the smallest among the group with the affected elbows in 
      patients. There was no difference between unaffected elbows and the non-patient 
      group. The cross-sectional area of the ulnar nerve highly correlated with cubital 
      tunnel symptoms in the flexion state. DISCUSSION: The shape of the cubital tunnel is 
      an important factor in cubital tunnel syndrome, and normal variations in the volume 
      and cross-sectional area of the cubital tunnel and ulnar nerve could influence the 
      occurrence of idiopathic cubital tunnel syndrome. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, 
      Therapeutic study.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a powerful MR imaging technique that can be used 
      to probe the microstructural environment of highly anisotropic tissues such as 
      peripheral nerves. DTI has been used predominantly in the central nervous system, 
      and its application in the peripheral nervous system does pose some challenges 
      related to imaging artifacts, the small caliber of peripheral nerves, and low water 
      proton density. However advances in MRI hardware and software have made it possible 
      to use the technique in the peripheral nervous system and to obtain functional data 
      relating to the effect of pathologic processes on peripheral nerves. This article 
      reviews the imaging principles behind DTI and examines the literature regarding its 
      application in assessing peripheral nerves.

TI  - Semi-automated volumetry of MRI serves as a biomarker in neuromuscular patients.
PG  - 600-607
LID - 10.1002/mus.26827 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle MRI is of increasing importance for neuromuscular patients to 
      detect changes in muscle volume, fat-infiltration, and edema. We developed a method 
      for semi-automated segmentation of muscle MRI datasets. METHODS: An active 
      contour-evolution algorithm implemented within the ITK-SNAP software was used to 
      segment T1-weighted MRI, and to quantify muscle volumes of neuromuscular patients (n 
      = 65). RESULTS: Semi-automated compared with manual segmentation was shown to be 
      accurate and time-efficient. Muscle volumes and ratios of thigh/lower leg volume 
      were lower in myopathy patients than in controls (P < .0001; P < .05). We found a 
      decrease of lower leg muscle volume in neuropathy patients compared with controls 
      (P < .01), which correlated with clinical parameters. In myopathy patients, muscle 
      volume showed a positive correlation with muscle strength (r(left) = 0.79, p(left) 
       < .0001). Muscle volumes were independent of body mass index and age. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our method allows for exact and time-efficient quantification of muscle volumes with 
      possible use as a biomarker in neuromuscular patients.

TI  - A combined DTI and resting state functional MRI study in patients with postherpetic 
      neuralgia.
PG  - 440-450
LID - 10.1007/s11604-020-00926-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the brain microstructural and functional changes in patients 
      with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 12 PHN patients and 12 
      healthy volunteers were enrolled. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state 
      functional MRI (rfMRI) sequences were scanned by a 3T MR scanner. Fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) t-maps were obtained following DTI data 
      processing. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF 
      (fALFF) were obtained following rfMRI data processing. A two sample t-test was 
      performed to compare the FA, MD, ALFF and fALFF differences between the PHN patients 
      and healthy controls. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted with regard to 
      the parameters gender, age and education years between the two groups. FA, MD, ALFF 
      and/or fALFF indicated significant alterations in specific pain or pain-related 
      brain regions, such as brainstem, cerebellum, parietal lobe, precuneus, frontal 
      lobe, temporal lobe, postcentral and precentral gyrus, corpus callosum, cingulate 
      gyrus, putamen and insula. CONCLUSION: Multi-local alterations of spontaneous brain 
      activity could form a network related to chronic pain, sensory discrimination, 
      emotion and cognition, suggesting complicated central mechanisms of PHN. The 
      combined-action of brain microstructure and function may play a critical role in 
      comprehension of neurological mechanisms of PHN-induced pain.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging abnormalities of the trigeminal nerve root in patients with 
      classical trigeminal neuralgia: a pre- and postoperative comparative study 4 years 
      after microvascular decompression.
PG  - 1415-1425
LID - 10.1007/s00701-019-03913-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is able to assess tissue integrity, 
      authors used diffusion to detect abnormalities in trigeminal nerves (TGN) in 
      patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) caused by neurovascular compression (NVC) 
      who had undergone microvascular decompression (MVD). The authors also studied 
      anatomical TGN parameters (cross-sectional area [CSA] and volume [V]). The study 
      compared pre- and postoperative findings. METHODS: Using DTI sequencing on a 3-T MRI 
      scanner, we measured the fraction of anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) of the TGN in 10 patients who had undergone MVD for TN and in 6 
      normal subjects. We compared data between affected and unaffected nerves in patients 
      and both nerves in normal subjects (controls). We then correlated these data with 
      CSA and V. Data from the affected side and the unaffected side before and 4 years 
      after MVD were compared. RESULTS: Before MVD, the FA of the affected side 
      (0.37 ± 0.03) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared to the unaffected side in 
      patients (0.48 ± 0.03) and controls (0.52 ± 0.02), and the ADC in the affected side 
      (5.6 ± 0.34 mm(2)/s) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to the unaffected 
      side in patients (4.26 ± 0.25 mm(2)/s) and controls (3.84 ± 0.18 mm(2)/s). Affected 
      nerves had smaller V and CSA compared to unaffected nerves and controls (p < 0.05). 
      After MVD, the FA in the affected side (0.41 ± 0.02) remained significantly lower 
      (p < 0.05) compared to the unaffected side (0.51 ± 0.02), but the ADC in the 
      affected side (4.24 ± 0.34 mm(2)/s) had become similar (p > 0.05) to the unaffected 
      side (4.01 ± 0.33 mm(2)/s). CONCLUSIONS: DTI revealed a loss of anisotropy and an 
      increase in diffusivity in affected nerves before surgery. Diffusion alterations 
      correlated with atrophic changes in patients with TN caused by NVC. After removal of 
      the compression, the loss of FA remained, but ADC normalized in the affected nerves, 
      suggesting improvement in the diffusion of the trigeminal root.

      MRI, and cadaveric measurements.
PG  - 122-127
LID - 10.1002/jcu.22647 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares median nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements 
      at the wrist obtained with ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      using cadaveric measurements as the gold standard. METHODS: Median nerve CSA was 
      measured using US and MRI in 9 cadaveric wrists obtained from 5 subjects at 5 
      locations: distal forearm, proximal to tunnel inlet, at tunnel inlet, at tunnel 
      outlet, and distal to tunnel outlet and then on identical cadaveric transverse 
      sections obtained with a bandsaw. All US, MRI, and cadaveric measurements were 
      repeated to determine reliability. Median nerves of 10 patients with clinical carpal 
      tunnel syndrome (CTS) were measured with US and MRI using an identical method US. 
      RESULTS: Median nerve CSA MRI measurements correlated better (Pearson correlation: 
      0.80-0.95, P < .05) with cadaveric measurements than with US measurements (Pearson 
      correlation: 0.61-0.79, P < .05). Median nerve CSA US measurements (8.6-12.5 mm(2) , 
      P < .05) were smaller at all levels than MRI (11.3-14.7 mm(2) ) or cadaveric 
      (11.0-14.9 mm(2) ) measurements while MRI and cadaver measurements were similar at 
      all levels. Median nerve CSA MRI measurements in CTS patients were larger than US 
      measurements at all levels. CONCLUSION: Median nerve CSA measurements by MRI are 
      larger than US measurements and correlated better with cadaveric measurements. 
      Median nerve CSA criteria used for diagnosing CTS on US are not likely to be 
      applicable to MRI.

TI  - Dorsal root ganglia volume is increased in patients with the Fabry-related GLA 
      variant p.D313Y.
PG  - 1332-1339
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09262-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine dorsal root ganglia and proximal nerve segments in patients 
      carrying the Fabry-related GLA-gene variant p.D313Y in comparison to patients with 
      classical Fabry mutations and healthy controls by morphometric and functional 
      magnetic resonance neurography. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study examines 
      the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve in 11 female p.D313Y patients 
      by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3 T. Volumes of dorsal 
      root ganglia L3 to S2, permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1, and spinal 
      nerve L5 as well as cross-sectional area of the sciatic nerve were assessed and 
      compared to 10 females carrying a classical Fabry mutation and 16 healthy female 
      controls. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, dorsal root ganglia volumes of 
      p.D313Y females were enlarged by 53% (L3), 48% (L4), 43% (L5), 57% (S1) (p < 0.001), 
      and 55% (S2) (p < 0.05), but less pronounced compared to females carrying a 
      classical Fabry mutation. Compared to healthy controls, p.D313Y patients showed no 
      changes of dorsal root ganglia vascular permeability, while patients with a 
      classical Fabry mutation showed a distinct decrease (p < 0.05). Sciatic nerve 
      cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6% in p.D313Y as well as in classical 
      Fabry patients (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients carrying the GLA-gene variant 
      p.D313Y show distinctly enlarged dorsal root ganglia, while vascular permeability 
      remains within normal limits. Overall, these alterations partially share 
      characteristics commonly seen in patients with a mutation causing classical FD. This 
      suggests that p.D313Y causes a potentially treatable condition resembling an early 
      stage of Fabry disease.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging features of the superior cervical ganglion and expected 
      changes after radiation therapy to the head and neck in a long-term follow-up.
PG  - 519-524
LID - 10.1007/s00234-020-02373-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the magnetic resonance (MRI) features of the 
      superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and to track changes to it induced using 
      radiotherapy across a long-term follow-up. METHODS: In total, 75 patients who 
      underwent radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies and who were studied with MRI 
      were recruited from two centers. MRI was performed before and after radiotherapy, 
      with a median long-term follow-up of 4.5 years. Baseline SCG features were assessed. 
      Changes in axial cross-sectional area, T2-normalized signal, and apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) (the latter available in about half of the patients) were 
      analyzed. Repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni's correction was 
      used to analyze changes in the aforementioned parameters (significance level 0.05). 
      RESULTS: Out of a potential 149 SCGs, 136 were visible at baseline MRI. A variable 
      spatial relationship with the internal carotid artery was found. SCGs showed the 
      "black dot" sign in almost all of the patients. ADC was higher in SCGs than in 
      regional lymph nodes. Cross-sectional area, normalized T2, and ADC increased in the 
      period up to 1 year after radiotherapy and then remained stable in subsequent 
      longer-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: The SCG has unusual features that allow 
      differentiation from the regional lymph nodes. Changes in morphology and signal 
      after radiotherapy must be taken into account by radiologists to avoid misdiagnosis 
      as recurrent nodal disease. Changes induced using radiotherapy are stable in 
      long-term follow-up and are thus likely attributed to other factors (such as Schwann 
      cell hypertrophy/proliferation) rather than edema.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging reveals microstructural alteration of the trigeminal nerve 
      root in classical trigeminal neuralgia without neurovascular compression and 
      correlation with outcome after internal neurolysis.
PG  - 37-44
LID - S0730-725X(20)30224-1 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to detect microstructural 
      alteration and effect of surgical treatment of the trigeminal nerve root (TR) in 
      patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia (CTN) underwent microvascular 
      decompression (MVD). Patients with CTN without neurovascular compression (woNVC) is 
      a special population of TN, however, the pathogenesy of CTN woNVC and the mechanism 
      of internal neurolysis (IN) remain unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 patients with 
      CTN woNVC who underwent IN and 20 healthy controls were included in this study. The 
      differences in the means, kurtosis and skewness of fractional anisotropy (FA) and 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between the affected and unaffected nerves in 
      patients and both nerves in controls were investigated by independent t-test and 
      paired t-test respectively. Longitudinal changes of FA and ADC were correlated with 
      outcome of IN via Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Significant differences 
      were found in preoperative mean and kurtosis values for both FA and ADC of the 
      affected side TR, compared to the unaffected side and control group respectively. 
      However, these differences remarkably reduced postoperatively. Further, the Spearman 
      correlation coefficient showed a strong negative correlation between decrease of ADC 
      in the affected side and the surgical outcome in BNI total score. CONCLUSION: The 
      changes of diffusive property of TR, especially the FA and ADC, provide alternative 
      radiological evidence for evaluating the mechanism of CTN woNVC. The modification of 
      DTI metrics could be an effective factor for providing potential noninvasive 
      biomarkers for determining the prognosis of patients with CTN woNVC underwent IN.

LID - 10.1111/cxo.12924 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate diagnosis of acute anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION) 
      is challenging to achieve with traditional medical imaging approaches. The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate the detection capacity of diffusion tensor imaging for 
      abnormalities of the optic nerve in acute AION patients. METHODS: Diffusion tensor 
      imaging data were collected from 31 patients with acute AION and 20 healthy 
      subjects. The mean fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion co-efficient 
      subsequently were evaluated across all subjects. RESULTS: In affected nerves, the 
      mean fractional anisotropy was reduced and the mean apparent diffusion co-efficient 
      was increased in acute AION patients compared with control nerves (p < 0.001), as 
      well as clinically unaffected contralateral nerves (p < 0.001). The mean fractional 
      anisotropy and apparent diffusion co-efficient demonstrated no difference between 
      normal control nerves and clinically unaffected contralateral nerves (p = 0.73 and 
      0.92, respectively). CONCLUSION: Diffusion tensor imaging of the optic nerves 
      demonstrated diagnostic potential for acute AION and could serve as a novel tool for 
      the detection and evaluation of therapies.

TI  - Peripheral Nerve Diffusion Tensor Imaging : Interreader and Test-retest Reliability 
      as Quantified by the Standard Error of Measurement.
PG  - 679-689
LID - 10.1007/s00062-019-00859-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is increasingly being used in magnetic 
      resonance neurography (MRN). The purpose of this study was to determine the 
      interreader and test-retest reliability of peripheral nerve DTI in MRN with focus on 
      the sciatic nerve. METHODS: In this prospective study 27 healthy volunteers each 
      underwent 3 scans of a short DTI protocol on separate days consisting of 
      a T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and single-shot DTI sequence of the sciatic nerve of 
      the dominant leg. The DTI parameters fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity 
      (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were obtained after manual 
      nerve segmentation by two independent readers. Intraclass correlation coefficients 
      (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and Bland-Altman plots were calculated 
      as measures for both interreader and test-retest agreement for all readout 
      parameters. RESULTS: The mean ± standard deviation was 0.507 ± 0.05 for FA, 
      1308.5 ± 162.4 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s for MD, 905.6 ± 145.4 ×10(-6) mm(2)/s for RD and 
      2114.1 ± 219.2 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s for AD. The SEM for FA was 0.02 for interreader and 
      test-retest agreement, the SEM for MD, RD, and AD ranged between 
      46.2 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s (RD) and 70.1 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s (AD) for interreader 
      reliability and between 45.9 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s (RD) and 70.1 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s (AD) 
      for test-retest reliability. The ICC for interreader reliability of DTI parameters 
      ranged between 0.81 and 0.92 and ICC for test-retest reliability between 0.76 and 
      0.91. CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve DTI of the sciatic nerve is reliable and 
      reproducible. The measures presented here may serve as first orientation values of 
      measurement accuracy when interpreting parameters of sciatic nerve DTI.

TI  - The effect of CSF drain on the optic nerve in idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
PG  - 59
LID - 10.1186/s10194-019-1004-1 [doi]
LID - 59
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevation of intracranial pressure in idiopathic intracranial 
      hypertension induces an edema of the prelaminar section of the optic nerve 
      (papilledema). Beside the commonly observed optic nerve sheath distention, 
      information on a potential pathology of the retrolaminar section of the optic nerve 
      and the short-term effect of normalization of intracranial pressure on these 
      abnormalities remains scarce. METHODS: In this exploratory study 8 patients 
      diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension underwent a MRI scan (T2 
      mapping) as well as a diffusion tensor imaging analysis (fractional anisotropy and 
      mean diffusivity). In addition, the clinical presentation of headache and its 
      accompanying symptoms were assessed. Intracranial pressure was then normalized by 
      lumbar puncture and the initial parameters (MRI and clinical features) were 
      re-assessed within 26 h. RESULTS: After normalization of CSF pressure, the 
      morphometric MRI scans of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath remained unchanged. 
      In the diffusion tensor imaging, the fractional anisotropy value was reduced 
      suggesting a tissue decompression of the optic nerve after lumbar puncture. In line 
      with these finding, headache and most of the accompanying symptoms also improved or 
      remitted within that short time frame. CONCLUSION: The findings support the 
      hypothesis that the elevation of intracranial pressure induces a microstructural 
      compression of the optic nerve impairing axoplasmic flow and thereby causing the 
      prelaminar papilledema. The microstructural compression of the optic nerve as well 
      as the clinical symptoms improve within hours of normalization of intracranial 
      pressure.

TI  - MRI analysis of carpal tunnel syndrome in hemodialysis patients versus 
      non-hemodialysis patients: a multicenter case-control study.
PG  - 91
LID - 10.1186/s13018-019-1114-0 [doi]
LID - 91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is common among patients receiving 
      hemodialysis and deeply influences their daily life. Amyloid deposits are considered 
      the main reason for median nerve compression, but its prevalence is unclear. 
      Therefore, to determine the main region of amyloid deposition inside the carpal 
      tunnel, we measured the cross-sectional area (CSA) of each component of the carpal 
      tunnel in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Thirty-five 
      hemodialysis patients (HD group) and age- and sex-matched 35 non-hemodialysis 
      patients (non-HD group), who underwent the first surgery for CTS in registered 
      hospitals from 2005 to 2015, were retrospectively enrolled. CTS was diagnosed from 
      clinical and electromyographic (EMG) findings. The CSA of carpal tunnel, each of the 
      flexor tendons, and the median nerve at the level of the hook of hamate were 
      measured in T1-weighted axial images in preoperative MRI, by using Synapse OP-A 
      software. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test and 
      Pearson's chi-squared test. RESULTS: The mean age of the HD group was 65.9 years and 
      the dialysis duration was 21.9 (11-35) years. The mean age of the non-HD group was 
      65.3 years. The CSA of carpal tunnel (p = 0.006), flexor tendon (p = 0.03), and 
      flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon (p = 0.04) were bigger in the HD group. 
      However, the median nerve, the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon, and the 
      flexor pollicis longus tendon (FPL) were not significantly different between the two 
      groups. The dialysis duration or age at surgery did not show any strong correlation 
      to each CSA. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that hemodialysis caused expansion of the 
      carpal tunnel due to amyloid deposition as previously described. Hemodialysis also 
      caused expansion of the CSA of the flexor tendon, especially the FDP, possibly 
      because of amyloid deposition inside the tendon. Furthermore, the duration of 
      dialysis or age did not correlate with any CSA, which could be due to the good 
      progress of the beta 2-microglobulin removal technique. Based on our results, FDS 
      excision could be considered in case severe deposition of amyloid in FDP is observed 
      during surgery.

AB  - In vivo human optic nerve diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is technically 
      challenging with two outstanding issues not yet well addressed: (i) non-linear optic 
      nerve movement, independent of head motion, and (ii) effect from partial-volumed 
      cerebrospinal fluid or interstitial fluid such as in edema. In this work, we 
      developed a non-linear optic nerve registration algorithm for improved volume 
      alignment in axial high resolution optic nerve dMRI. During eyes-closed dMRI data 
      acquisition, optic nerve dMRI measurements by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with 
      and without free water elimination (FWE), and by diffusion basis spectrum imaging 
      (DBSI), as well as optic nerve motion, were characterized in healthy adults at 
      various locations along the posterior-to-anterior dimension. Optic nerve DTI results 
      showed consistent trends in microstructural parametric measurements along the 
      posterior-to-anterior direction of the entire intraorbital optic nerve, while the 
      anterior portion of the intraorbital optic nerve exhibited the largest spatial 
      displacement. Multi-compartmental dMRI modeling, such as DTI with FWE or DBSI, was 
      less subject to spatially dependent biases in diffusivity and anisotropy 
      measurements in the optic nerve which corresponded to similar spatial distributions 
      of the estimated fraction of isotropic diffusion components. DBSI results derived 
      from our clinically feasible (∼10 min) optic nerve dMRI protocol in this study are 
      consistent with those from small animal studies, which provides the basis for 
      evaluating the utility of multi-compartmental dMRI modeling in characterizing 
      coexisting pathophysiology in human optic neuropathies.

AB  - From time to time it is thoughtful and productive to review a medical field and 
      reflect upon what are the major issues that need to be addressed and what is being 
      done to do so. This review article is not meant to be all-inclusive but rather 
      focuses on four evolving areas in the field of peripheral nerve disorders and 
      treatments: (1) nerve surgery under ultrasound guidance using a new ultra-minimally 
      invasive thread technique; (2) evolving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
      ultrasound imaging techniques that are helping to both diagnose and treat a variety 
      of peripheral nerve problems including entrapment neuropathies, traumatic nerve 
      injuries, and masses arising from nerves; (3) promoting recovery after nerve injury 
      using electrical stimulation; and (4) developing animal models to reproduce a severe 
      nerve injury (neurotmetic grade in continuity) that requires a surgical intervention 
      and repair. In each area we first describe the current challenges and then discuss 
      new and emerging techniques and approaches. It is our hope that this article will 
      bring added attention and resources to help better address peripheral nerve problems 
      that remain a challenge for both patients and physicians.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identify sonographic features of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve 
      (LFCN) in meralgia paresthetica (MP) and report therapeutic outcomes in 
      sonographically confirmed cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 50 
      patients with clinically suspected MP and 20 controls. Ultrasounds were reviewed for 
      characteristics of the LFCN and compared between groups. When available, MRIs were 
      reviewed. In cases of sonographically pathologic LFCN, subsequent therapeutic 
      interventions were recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-five of the suspected MP cases (70%) 
      had ultrasound findings suggestive of MP, 10 (20%) were negative, and in 5 (10%) the 
      LFCN was not seen. Sonographic findings in positive cases included nerve enlargement 
      in all cases (mean cross-sectional area 9 mm(2) (standard deviation (SD) ± 5.59) 
      versus 4 mm(2) (SD ± 2.31) and 3 mm(2) (SD ± 2.31) in negative cases and normal 
      controls, respectively; p < 0.01), nerve hypoechogenicity (30 of 35 cases, 86%), and 
      focal lesion (7 of 35 cases, 20%). Sixteen ultrasounds positive for MP had MRIs with 
      only 4 (25%) reporting a concordant LFCN abnormality (enlargement or T2 
      hyperintensity). Twenty-five of the 35 (71%) patients with positive sonographic 
      findings for MP had a US-guided LFCN block (local anesthetic ± corticosteroid), with 
      24 of 25 (96%) patients reporting immediate symptomatic improvement. Eighteen of 35 
      (51%) underwent LFCN neurectomy or neurolysis, all of whom experienced symptomatic 
      improvement. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound is a useful modality for LFCN assessment in 
      clinically suspected MP and is more sensitive for abnormalities than MRI. Nearly all 
      patients who received perineural analgesia and/or neurectomy or neurolysis had 
      symptomatic improvement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess fractional anisotropy (FA) of sciatic nerve roots within the 
      pelvis by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients suffering from sciatica 
      with inconclusive lumbar MRI. METHODS: This IRB-approved prospective study included 
      32 consecutive subjects (11 males and 21 females; mean age 32.2 years) between 
      September 2019 and February 2020. All patients underwent DTI (TR/TE 5800/97 ms; 
      b = 1000; slice thickness 3,5 mm; directions = 20) on a 1.5 T scanner (Siemens 
      Aera). Seventeen patients were symptomatic, whereas 15 patients served as control 
      group. DTI data were analyzed by two radiologists (25 and 11 years of experience, 
      respectively) blinded to clinical data. Each radiologist placed two ROIs on the 
      nerve roots at three different levels. Diagnostic accuracy values of FA numbers were 
      calculated by using receiver operator curves (ROC) and relative area under the curve 
      (AUC), by using clinical findings as standard of reference. Inter-observer agreement 
      was calculated with k-statistics. Paired T-test and Mann-Whitney test were used for 
      comparison accordingly to data distribution. A value of p < 0.05 was considered 
      statistically significant. RESULTS: Among the 17 symptomatic patients, FA values 
      were significantly lower in the affected side at all levels (p < 0.05). The FA ratio 
      (FA affected side/FA unaffected side) of symptomatic patients was significantly 
      lower compared to control group at level 1 (p = 0.0005) and level 2 (p = 0.0006). 
      Using a threshold of 0.90 for level 1 and 0.73 for level 2, 76 % and 71 % 
      sensitivity and 100 % and 87 % specificity were achieved, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      DTI can quantitatively demonstrate sciatic nerve roots impairment within the pelvis.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to provide normal reference values for quantitative 
      parameters for brachial and lumbosacral plexi on multimodal MRI. In addition, the 
      parameter variations between the left and right sides, the individual nerve groups, 
      genders and age groups were also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multimodal MRI 
      was evaluated in 163 healthy subjects, who were randomly divided into three groups: 
      brachial plexus, lumbosacral plexus and diffusion tensor imaging groups. Nerve 
      diameters, contrast ratios, T2 nerve-muscle signal ratios (nT2), fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) values and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were measured in 
      both plexi. Parametric tests and Pearson correlation for normally distributed data, 
      and non-parametric tests and Spearman correlation for non-normally distributed data 
      were used. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in parameters between the 
      left and right sides. The diameters of the C7, L4-S1, sciatic, and femoral nerve 
      roots were larger in men than in women (P < 0.05). The nT2 in the brachial and 
      lumbosacral plexi and the contrast ratio in the lumbosacral plexus were 
      significantly higher in the elderly. The diameter of the S1 nerve root was smaller 
      in the elderly. There were no significant differences between the individual nerve 
      groups in contrast ratios and in brachial plexus nT2. A gradual increase in the nT2 
      from the top to the bottom was observed in the L4-S1 nerve roots (P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: This study provides multi-parameter normative data for the brachial and 
      lumbosacral plexi while considering differences between the two sides, the 
      individual nerves, genders, and the ages.

TI  - Application of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and MR-tractography in the evaluation 
      of peripheral nerve tumours: state of the art and review of the literature.
PG  - 68-76
LID - 10.23750/abm.v90i5-S.8326 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral nerves can be affected by a variety of benign and malignant tumour and 
      tumour-like lesions. Besides clinical evaluation and electrophysiologic studies, MRI 
      is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of these soft tissue tumours. 
      Conventional MR sequences, however, can fail to assess the histologic features of 
      the lesions. Moreover, the precise topographical relationship between the peripheral 
      nerve and the tumor must be delineated preoperatively for complete tumour resection 
      minimizing nerve damage. Using Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography, it 
      is possible to obtain functional information on tumour and nerve structures, 
      allowing the assess anatomy, function and biological features. In this article, we 
      review the technical aspects and clinical application of DTI for the evaluation of 
      peripheral nerve tumours.

TI  - Structural Nerve Remodeling at 3-T MR Neurography Differs between Painful and 
      Painless Diabetic Polyneuropathy in Type 1 or 2 Diabetes.
PG  - 405-414
LID - 10.1148/radiol.2019191347 [doi]
AB  - Background The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying painful symptoms in diabetic 
      polyneuropathy (DPN) are poorly understood. They may be associated with MRI 
      characteristics, which have not yet been investigated. Purpose To investigate 
      correlations between nerve structure, load and spatial distribution of nerve 
      lesions, and pain in patients with DPN. Materials and Methods In this prospective 
      single-center cross-sectional study, participants with type 1 or 2 diabetes 
      volunteered between June 2015 and March 2018. Participants underwent 3-T MR 
      neurography of the sciatic nerve with a T2-weighed fat-suppressed sequence, which 
      was preceded by clinical and electrophysiologic tests. For group comparisons, 
      analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed depending on Gaussian 
      or non-Gaussian distribution of data. Spearman correlation coefficients were 
      calculated for correlation analysis. Results A total of 131 participants (mean age, 
      62 years ± 11 [standard deviation]; 82 men) with either type 1 (n = 45) or type 2 (n 
      = 86) diabetes were evaluated with painful (n = 64), painless (n = 37), or no (n = 
      30) DPN. Participants who had painful diabetic neuropathy had a higher percentage of 
      nerve lesions in the full nerve volume (15.2% ± 1.6) than did participants with 
      nonpainful DPN (10.4% ± 1.7, P = .03) or no DPN (8.3% ± 1.7; P < .001). The amount 
      and extension of T2-weighted hyperintense nerve lesions correlated positively with 
      the neuropathy disability score (r = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21, 0.52; 
      r = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.52, respectively) and the neuropathy symptom score (r = 
      0.41; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.55; r = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.49, respectively). Negative 
      correlations were found for the tibial nerve conduction velocity (r = -0.23; 95% CI: 
      -0.44, -0.01; r = -0.37; 95% CI: -0.55, -0.15, respectively). The cross-sectional 
      area of the nerve was positively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r 
      = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.36). Negative correlations were found for the tibial nerve 
      conduction velocity (r = -0.24; 95% CI: -0.45, -0.01). Conclusion The amount and 
      extension of T2-weighted hyperintense fascicular nerve lesions were greater in 
      patients with painful diabetic neuropathy than in those with painless diabetic 
      neuropathy. These results suggest that proximal fascicular damage is associated with 
      the evolution of painful sensory symptoms in diabetic polyneuropathy. © RSNA, 2019

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging Adds Diagnostic Accuracy in Magnetic Resonance Neurography.
PG  - 498-504
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000156 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether quantitative diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) adds diagnostic accuracy in magnetic resonance neurography. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the institutional 
      review board. We enrolled 16 patients with peripheral polyneuropathy of various 
      etiologies involving the upper arm and 30 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance 
      neurography was performed at 3 T using transverse T2-weighted (T2-w) turbo spin echo 
      and spin echo planar imaging diffusion-weighted sequences. T2-weighted normalized 
      signal (nT2), fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), 
      radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) of the median, ulnar, and radial 
      nerves were quantified after manual segmentation. Diagnostic performance of each 
      separate parameter and combinations of parameters was assessed using the area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Bootstrap validation was used to 
      adjust for potential overfitting. RESULTS: Average nT2, ADC, RD, and AD values of 
      the median, ulnar, and radial nerve were significantly increased in neuropathy 
      patients compared with that in healthy controls (nT2, 1.49 ± 0.05 vs 1.05 ± 0.05; 
      ADC, 1.4 × 10(-3) ± 2.8 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 1.1 × 10(-3) ± 1.3 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s; RD, 
      9.5 × 10(-4) ± 2.9 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 7.2 × 10(-4) ± 1.3 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s; AD, 2.3 
      × 10(-3) ± 3.7 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 2.0 × 10(-3) ± 2.2 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s; P < 0.001 
      for all comparisons). Fractional anisotropy values were significantly decreased in 
      patients (0.51 ± 0.01 vs 0.59 ± 0.01; P < 0.001). T2-weighted normalized signal and 
      DTI parameters had comparable diagnostic accuracy (adjusted AUC: T2-w, 0.92; FA, 
      0.88; ADC, 0.89; AD, 0.84; RD, 0.86). Combining DTI parameters significantly 
      improved the diagnostic accuracy over single-parameter analysis. In addition, the 
      combination of nT2 with DTI parameters yielded excellent adjusted AUCs up to 0.97 
      (nT2 + FA). CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging has high diagnostic accuracy in 
      peripheral neuropathy. Combining DTI with T2 can outperform T2-w imaging alone and 
      provides added value in magnetic resonance neurography.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine normative morphological and functional magnetic resonance (MR) 
      neurography values in children and adolescents in correlation to demographic 
      determinants. METHODS: In this study 29 healthy underage subjects (mean age 13.9 
      years, range 10-17 years) were examined using a standardized MR neurography protocol 
      of the lumbosacral plexus and the right lower extremity at 3 T. Volumes of the 
      dorsal root ganglia L3-S2, cross-sectional area of the sciatic and tibial nerves, as 
      well as T2-weighted contrast nerve-muscle ratio and quantitative diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) values of the sciatic nerve were obtained and correlated with the 
      demographic parameters sex, age, height and weight. RESULTS: While all obtained 
      morphological and functional MR neurography values did not differ between male and 
      female sex, dorsal root ganglia volume, sciatic and tibial nerve cross-sectional 
      area correlated positively with age, height, and weight. The T2-weighted signal of 
      the sciatic nerve was independent of demographic determinants. Negative correlation 
      was found for fractional anisotropy (FA) with age, height, and weight, whereas 
      radial diffusivity (RD) showed a positive correlation only with age. Mean 
      diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) revealed no correlation with demographic 
      determinants. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that selection of 
      sex-matched controls for further studies assessing peripheral nerve pathologies in 
      underage patients may not be necessary; however, control subjects should be adapted 
      to age, height, and weight of the patient population, especially if assessing dorsal 
      root ganglia volume, nerve cross-sectional area and DTI.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established imaging modality which is 
      used in all districts of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems. More 
      recently, initial studies have applied multiparametric MRI to evaluate 
      quantitatively different aspects of musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve diseases, 
      thus providing not only images but also numbers and clinical data. Besides (1)H and 
      (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and blood 
      oxygenation level-dependent imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a relatively 
      new MRI-based technique relying on principles of DWI, which has traditionally been 
      used mainly for evaluating the central nervous system to track fibre course. In the 
      musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems, DTI has been mostly used in 
      experimental settings, with still few indications in clinical practice. In this 
      review, we describe the potential use of DTI to evaluate different musculoskeletal 
      and peripheral nerve conditions, emphasising the translational aspects of this 
      technique from the experimental to the clinical setting.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the development of morphologic and 
      diffusion tensor imaging sequences of peripheral nerves at 7 T, using carpal tunnel 
      syndrome (CTS) as a model system of focal nerve injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Morphologic images were acquired at 7 T using a balanced steady-state free 
      precession sequence. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed using single-shot 
      echo-planar imaging and readout-segmented echo-planar imaging sequences. Different 
      acquisition and postprocessing methods were compared to describe the optimal 
      analysis pipeline. Magnetic resonance imaging parameters including cross-sectional 
      areas, signal intensity, fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as mean, axial, and 
      radial diffusivity were compared between patients with CTS (n = 8) and healthy 
      controls (n = 6) using analyses of covariance corrected for age (significance set at 
      P < 0.05). Pearson correlations with Bonferroni correction were used to determine 
      association of magnetic resonance imaging parameters with clinical measures 
      (significance set at P < 0.01). RESULTS: The 7 T acquisitions with high in-plane 
      resolution (0.2 × 0.2mm) afforded detailed morphologic resolution of peripheral 
      nerve fascicles. For diffusion tensor imaging, single-shot echo-planar imaging was 
      more efficient than readout-segmented echo-planar imaging in terms of 
      signal-to-noise ratio per unit scan time. Distortion artifacts were pronounced, but 
      could be corrected during postprocessing. Registration of FA maps to the morphologic 
      images was successful. The developed imaging and analysis pipeline identified lower 
      median nerve FA (pisiform bone, 0.37 [SD 0.10]) and higher radial diffusivity (1.08 
      [0.20]) in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (0.53 [0.06] and 0.78 
      [0.11], respectively, P < 0.047). Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity 
      strongly correlated with patients' symptoms (r = -0.866 and 0.866, respectively, P = 
      0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the feasibility of morphologic and 
      diffusion peripheral nerve imaging at 7 T. Fractional anisotropy and radial 
      diffusivity were found to be correlates of symptom severity.

PG  - 398-421
LID - 10.21037/qims.2017.08.01 [doi]
AB  - Traumatic conditions of peripheral nerves and plexus have been classically evaluated 
      by morphological imaging techniques and electrophysiological tests. New magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) studies based on 3D fat-suppressed techniques are providing 
      high accuracy for peripheral nerve injury evaluation from a qualitative point of 
      view. However, these techniques do not provide quantitative information. Diffusion 
      weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are functional MRI 
      techniques that are able to evaluate and quantify the movement of water molecules 
      within different biological structures. These techniques have been successfully 
      applied in other anatomical areas, especially in the assessment of central nervous 
      system, and now are being imported, with promising results for peripheral nerve and 
      plexus evaluation. DWI and DTI allow performing a qualitative and quantitative 
      peripheral nerve analysis, providing valuable pathophysiological information about 
      functional integrity of these structures. In the field of trauma and peripheral 
      nerve or plexus injury, several derived parameters from DWI and DTI studies such as 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or fractional anisotropy (FA) among others, can 
      be used as potential biomarkers of neural damage providing information about fiber 
      organization, axonal flow or myelin integrity. A proper knowledge of physical basis 
      of these techniques and their limitations is important for an optimal interpretation 
      of the imaging findings and derived data. In this paper, a comprehensive review of 
      the potential applications of DWI and DTI neurographic studies is performed with a 
      focus on traumatic conditions, including main nerve entrapment syndromes in both 
      peripheral nerves and brachial or lumbar plexus.

TI  - Atrophic Changes and Diffusion Abnormalities of Affected Trigeminal Nerves in 
      Trigeminal Neuralgia Using 7-T MRI.
PG  - 169-175
LID - 10.1159/000502222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used for visualizing 
      trigeminal nerves in trigeminal neuralgia. OBJECTIVE: To assess atrophy and 
      diffusion abnormalities of affected trigeminal nerves in trigeminal neuralgia with 
      7-T MRI. METHODS: In this prospective study, 14 patients (mean age 49 years; range 
      31-64 years) with trigeminal neuralgia underwent 7-T MRI. We measured trigeminal 
      nerve volumes along their course through the pontocerebellar cistern. We also 
      evaluated fractional anisotropy (FA) and quantitative anisotropy (QA) values within 
      cisternal segment and pontine nuclei of the affected-side and unaffected-side 
      trigeminal nerves, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Associations between DTI 
      metrics and Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scores were examined. RESULTS: 
      The volumes were significantly smaller for the affected trigeminal nerves (33.83 ± 
      23.12 mm3) than for the unaffected ones (47.76 ± 32.48 mm3; p = 0.008). Cisternal 
      segment FA and QA values were significantly lower in affected trigeminal nerves than 
      in unaffected ones. However, DTI measurements in the pontine nuclei revealed no 
      significant differences between affected-side and unaffected-side trigeminal nerves. 
      No DTI metrics significantly correlated with BNI pain scores. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results suggest that 7-T MRI allows identifications of atrophy and diffusion 
      abnormalities of trigeminal nerves in trigeminal neuralgia.

TI  - Assessment of Auditory Pathways Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Patients with 
      Neurofibromatosis Type 1.
PG  - 890-894
LID - 10.2174/1573405614666180425124743 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of our study was to determine whether the diffusion properties of the 
      auditory pathways alter between patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and the 
      healthy subjects. DTI can well demonstrate FA and ADC changes in auditory tracts and 
      it may be a guide to identify the candidates for hearing loss among NF1 children. 
      METHODS: The study population consisted of 43 patients with NF1 and 21 healthy 
      controls. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to measure apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values from lemniscus lateralis, 
      colliculus inferior, corpus geniculatum mediale and Heschl's gyrus. The results were 
      compared with those of the control group. RESULTS: The ADC values of lateral 
      lemniscus, colliculus inferior and corpus geniculatum mediale were significantly 
      higher in NF1 compared to those of the control group. On the other hand, decreased 
      FA values were observed in lateral lemniscus and colliculus inferior in patients 
      with NF1. CONCLUSION: The increase in ADC and reduction in FA in the auditory 
      pathways of patients with NF1 may suggest microstructural alterations, such as a 
      decrease in the number of axons, edema or inflammation in the auditory tracts.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging for assessment of microstructural changes associate with 
      treatment outcome at one-year after radiofrequency Rhizotomy in trigeminal 
      neuralgia.
PG  - 62
LID - 10.1186/s12883-019-1295-5 [doi]
LID - 62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is characterized by facial pain that may be 
      sudden, intense, and recurrent. Neurosurgical interventions, such as radiofrequency 
      rhizotomy, can relieve TN pain, but their mechanisms and effects are unknown. The 
      aim of the present study was to investigate the microstructural tissue changes of 
      the trigeminal nerve (TGN) in patients with TN after they underwent radiofrequency 
      rhizotomy. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with TN were recruited, and diffusion 
      tensor imaging was obtained before and two weeks after radiofrequency rhizotomy. By 
      manually selecting the cisternal segment of the TGN, we measured the volume of the 
      TGN, fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial 
      diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). The TGN volume and mean value of the 
      DTI metrics of the post-rhizotomy lesion side were compared with those of the normal 
      side and those of the pre-rhizotomy lesion side, and they were correlated to the 
      post-rhizotomy visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores after a one-year follow-up. 
      RESULTS: The alterations before and after rhizotomy showed a significantly increased 
      TGN volume and FA, and a decreased ADC, AD, and RD. The post-rhizotomy lesion side 
      showed a significantly decreased TGN volume, FA, and AD compared with the normal 
      side; however, no significant difference in the ADC and RD were found between the 
      groups. The TGN volume was significantly higher in the non-responders than in the 
      responders (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Our results may reflect that the effects of 
      radiofrequency rhizotomy in TN patients include axonal damage with perineural edema 
      and that prolonged swelling associated with recurrence might be predicted by MRI 
      images. Further studies are necessary to understand how DTI metrics can 
      quantitatively represent the pathophysiology of TN and to examine the application of 
      DTI in the treatment of TN.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging in musculoskeletal disorders.
PG  - E56-72
LID - 10.1148/rg.343125062 [doi]
AB  - Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging is an emerging magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 
      technique for evaluating the microstructure of well-organized biologic tissues such 
      as muscles and nerves. DT imaging provides information about tissue microstructure 
      by producing three-dimensional maps of water molecule movements. The two main 
      parameters of measurement at DT imaging, fractional anisotropy and the apparent 
      diffusion coefficient, allow quantitation of architectural changes occurring in 
      tissue. These parameters are modified in the presence of cervical spondylotic 
      myelopathy, cervical spine trauma, carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar nerve compression, 
      peripheral nerve tumors, and muscle ischemia. Their alteration may be observed at DT 
      imaging even when no abnormality is seen at conventional MR imaging, a fact that 
      suggests that DT imaging allows the detection of abnormalities at an earlier stage 
      of injury. Experimental studies in animals have shown that DT imaging consistently 
      allows identification of pathophysiologic alterations in tissue that correlate with 
      histologic findings. Tractographic images accurately depict both normal and abnormal 
      diffusion in anatomic structures such as the thigh and pelvic muscles, cervical 
      spine, and lumbar nerves. Patients with chronic diseases also may benefit from 
      follow-up evaluation with DT imaging, although DT imaging sequences must be further 
      adapted to improve the evaluation of specific anatomic regions by reducing 
      artifacts, optimizing spatial resolution, and minimizing acquisition time. Given its 
      proven potential for use in identifying abnormalities that are otherwise 
      identifiable only with electrophysiologic and histopathologic studies, and with 
      future technical improvements, DT imaging could soon become a standard method for 
      early diagnosis, management, and follow-up of disease in the spine, muscles, and 
      peripheral nerves.

TI  - Association of Serum Cholesterol Levels With Peripheral Nerve Damage in Patients 
      With Type 2 Diabetes.
PG  - e194798
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.4798 [doi]
LID - e194798
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Lowering serum cholesterol levels is a well-established treatment for 
      dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, nerve lesions in 
      patients with T2D increase with lower serum cholesterol levels, suggesting that 
      lowering serum cholesterol levels is associated with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) 
      in patients with T2D. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is an association 
      between serum cholesterol levels and peripheral nerve lesions in patients with T2D 
      with and without DPN. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center, 
      cross-sectional, prospective cohort study was performed from June 1, 2015, to March 
      31, 2018. Observers were blinded to clinical data. A total of 256 participants were 
      approached, of whom 156 were excluded. A total of 100 participants consented to 
      undergo magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg at the Department of 
      Neuroradiology and clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic assessment at the 
      Department of Endocrinology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. 
      EXPOSURES: Quantification of the nerve's diameter and lipid equivalent lesion (LEL) 
      load with a subsequent analysis of all acquired clinical and serologic data with use 
      of 3.0-T magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg with 3-dimensional 
      reconstruction of the sciatic nerve. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome 
      was lesion load and extension. Secondary outcomes were clinical, serologic, and 
      electrophysiologic findings. RESULTS: A total of 100 participants with T2D (mean 
      [SD] age, 64.6 [0.9] years; 68 [68.0%] male) participated in the study. The LEL load 
      correlated positively with the nerve's mean cross-sectional area (r = 0.44; 
      P < .001) and the maximum length of a lesion (r = 0.71; P < .001). The LEL load was 
      negatively associated with total serum cholesterol level (r = -0.41; P < .001), 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = -0.30; P = .006), low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = -0.33; P = .003), nerve conduction velocities of 
      the tibial (r = -0.33; P = .01) and peroneal (r = -0.51; P < .001) nerves, and nerve 
      conduction amplitudes of the tibial (r = -0.31; P = .02) and peroneal (r = -0.28; 
      P = .03) nerves. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that lowering serum 
      cholesterol levels in patients with T2D and DPN is associated with a higher amount 
      of nerve lesions and declining nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes. These 
      findings may be relevant to emerging therapies that promote an aggressive lowering

AB  - Electroacupuncture (EA) is an adjuvant therapy for peripheral nerve injury (PNI). 
      Both peripheral and central alterations contribute to the rehabilitation process. We 
      employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the diffusion plasticity of 
      afferent and efferent pathways caused by EA in model of peripheral nerve injury and 
      reparation. Twenty-four rats were divided into three groups: normal group, model 
      group and intervention group. Rats of the model group and the intervention group 
      underwent sciatic nerve transection and anastomosis. EA intervention was performed 
      on the intervention group at ST-36 and GB-30 for three months. Gait assessment and 
      DTI were conducted at days post-operative (DPO) 30, 60 and 90. We selected 
      corticospinal tract, spinothalamic tract and internal capsule as regions of interest 
      and analyzed diffusion metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial 
      diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). FA values and RD values displayed 
      significant differences or obvious tendency while AD values maintained a stable 
      level. RD values displayed better indicative performance than FA in internal 
      capsule. The intervention group presented significant correlation between RD values 
      and Regularity Index (RI) during the intervention period. The effect of EA on 
      peripheral nerve injury repairing rats appeared to be accelerated recovery process 
      of sensory and motor neural pathway. We proposed that RD was a potential in vivo 
      indicator for structural plasticity caused by EA and PNI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the optic nerve is 
      affected by thyroid eye disease (TED) before the development of dysthyroid optic 
      neuropathy with diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Twenty TED patients and 20 
      controls were included. The mean, axial, and radial diffusivities and fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) value were measured at the optic nerves in DTI. Extraocular muscle 
      diameters were measured on computed tomography. The diffusivities and FA of the 
      optic nerves were compared between TED and controls and between active and inactive 
      stages of TED. The correlations between these DTI parameters and the clinical 
      features were determined. RESULTS: The mean, axial, and radial diffusivities were 
      lower in TED compared with the controls (P < 0.05). In contrast, FA was higher in 
      TED (P = 0.001). Radial diffusivity was lower in the active stage of TED than the 
      inactive stage (P = 0.035). The FA was higher in the TED group than in the control 
      group (P = 0.021) and was positively correlated with clinical activity score (r = 
      0.364, P = 0.021), modified NOSPECS score (r = 0.469, P = 0.002), and extraocular 
      muscle thickness (r = 0.325, P = 0.041) in the TED group. Radial diffusivity was 
      negatively correlated with modified NOSPECS score (r = -0.384, P = 0.014), and axial 
      diffusivity was positively correlated with exophthalmos degree (r = 0.363, P = 
      0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The diffusivities and FA reflected changes in the optic nerve 
      before dysthyroid optic neuropathy in TED. The FA, in particular, reflected TED 
      activity and severity.

AB  - The stress system provides integration of both neurochemical and somatic physiologic 
      functions within organisms as an adaptive mechanism to changing environmental 
      conditions throughout evolution. In mammals and primates the complexity and 
      sophistication of these systems have surpassed other species in triaging 
      neurochemical and physiologic signaling to maximize chances of survival. 
      Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and its related peptides and receptors have 
      been identified over the last three decades and are fundamental molecular initiators 
      of the stress response. They are crucial in the top down regulatory cascade over a 
      myriad of neurochemical, neuroendocrine and sympathetic nervous system events. From 
      neuroscience, we've seen that stress activation impacts behavior, endocrine and 
      somatic physiology and influences neurochemical events that one can capture in real 
      time with current imaging technologies. To delineate these effects one can 
      demonstrate how the CRH neuronal networks infiltrate critical cognitive, emotive and 
      autonomic regions of the central nervous system (CNS) with somatic effects. Abundant 
      preclinical and clinical studies show inter-regulatory actions of CRH with multiple 
      neurotransmitters/peptides. Stress, both acute and chronic has epigenetic effects 
      which magnify genetic susceptibilities to alter neurochemistry; stress system 
      activation can add critical variables in design and interpretation of basic and 
      clinical neuroscience and related research. This review will attempt to provide an 
      overview of the spectrum of known functions and speculative actions of CRH and 
      stress responses in light of imaging technology and its interpretation. Metabolic 
      and neuroreceptor positron emission/single photon tomography (PET/SPECT), functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), anatomic MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and 
      proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (pMRS) are technologies that can delineate 
      basic mechanisms of neurophysiology and pharmacology. Stress modulates the myriad of 
      neurochemical and networks within and controlled through the central and peripheral 
      nervous system and the effects of stress activation on imaging will be highlighted.

TI  - Texture analysis using T1-weighted images for muscles in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 
      patients and volunteers.
PG  - 3508-3517
LID - 10.1007/s00330-020-07435-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore whether texture features using T1-weighted images correlate 
      with fat fraction, and whether they differ between Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease 
      patients and volunteers. METHODS: The institutional review board approved this 
      retrospective study, and the requirement for informed consent was waived; data of 
      eighteen CMT patients and eighteen healthy volunteers from a previous study was 
      used. Texture features of the muscles including mean, standard deviation (SD), 
      skewness, kurtosis, and entropy of the signal intensity were derived from 
      T1-weighted images. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to assess the 
      relationship between texture features and fat fraction measured by 3D multiple 
      gradient echo Dixon-based sequence. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the 
      texture features between CMT patients and volunteers. Intraobserver and 
      interobserver agreements for the texture features were assessed using the intraclass 
      correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The SD (ρ = 0.256, p < 0.001) and entropy 
      (ρ = 0.263, p < 0.001) were significantly and positively correlated with fat 
      fraction; skewness (ρ = - 0.110, p = 0.027) and kurtosis (ρ = - 0.149, p = 0.003) 
      were significantly and inversely correlated with fat fraction. The CMT patients 
      showed a significantly higher SD (63.45 vs. 49.26; p < 0.001), skewness (1.06 vs. 
      0.56; p < 0.001), kurtosis (4.00 vs. 1.81; p < 0.001), and entropy (3.20 vs. 3.02; 
      p < 0.001) than did the volunteers. Intraobserver and interobserver agreements were 
      almost perfect for mean, SD, and entropy. CONCLUSIONS: Texture features using 
      T1-weighted images correlated with fat fraction and differed between CMT patients 
      and volunteers. KEY POINTS: • Standard deviation and entropy of muscles derived from 
      T1-weighted images were significantly and positively correlated with the muscle fat 
      fraction. • Mean, standard deviation, and entropy were considered highly reliable in 
      muscle analyses. • Texture features may have the potential to diagnose early stage 
      of intramuscular fatty infiltration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance 
      neurography (DW-MRN) in the visualisation of extremity nerves in the wrist and palm. 
      METHODS: Thirty-two volunteers and 21 patients underwent imaging of the wrist and 
      palm on a 3-T MR scanner. In all subjects, two radiologists evaluated the image 
      quality on DW-MRN using a four-point grading scale. Kappa statistics were obtained 
      for inter-observer performance. In volunteers, the chi-squared test was used to 
      assess the differences in nerve visualisation on DW-MRN and axial fat-suppressed 
      proton density weighted imaging (FS-PDWI). RESULTS: In volunteers, the mean image 
      quality scores for the median nerve (MN) and ulnar nerve (UN) were 3.71 ± 0.46 and 
      3.23 ± 0.67 for observer 1, and 3.70 ± 0.46 and 3.22 ± 0.71 for observer 2, 
      respectively. The inter-observer agreement was excellent (k = 0.843) and good 
      (k = 0.788), respectively. DW-MRN provided significantly improved visualisations of 
      the second and the third common palmar digital nerves and three branches of UN 
      compared with FS-PDWI (P < 0.05). In patients, the mean image quality scores for the 
      two observers were 3.24 ± 0.62 and 3.10 ± 0.83, inter-observer performance was 
      excellent (k = 0.842). CONCLUSIONS: DW-MRN is feasible for improved visualisation of 
      extremity nerves and their lesions in the wrist and palm with adequate image 
      quality, thereby providing a supplementary method to conventional MR imaging. KEY 
      POINTS: • DW-MRN provides adequate image quality for wrist and palm neurography • 
      DW-MRN performs similarly to FS-PDWI in nerve visualisation at the wrist • DW-MRN 
      provides improved visualisation of small nerves in the palm • DW-MRN serves as a 
      supplementary method to evaluate peripheral neuropathies.

TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot infections.
PG  - 212S-238S
AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 1. Foot infections in patients with diabetes cause substantial 
      morbidity and frequent visits to health care professionals and may lead to 
      amputation of a lower extremity. 2. Diabetic foot infections require attention to 
      local (foot) and systemic (metabolic) issues and coordinated management, preferably 
      by a multidisciplinary foot-care team (A-II). The team managing these infections 
      should include, or have ready access to, an infectious diseases specialist or a 
      medical microbiologist (B-II). 3. The major predisposing factor to these infections 
      is foot ulceration, which is usually related to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral 
      vascular disease and various immunological disturbances play a secondary role. 4. 
      Aerobic Gram-positive cocci (especially Staphylococcus aureus) are the predominant 
      pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have chronic wounds or who have 
      recently received antibiotic therapy may also be infected with Gram-negative rods, 
      and those with foot ischemia or gangrene may have obligate anaerobic pathogens. 5. 
      Wound infections must be diagnosed clinically on the basis of local (and 
      occasionally systemic) signs and symptoms of inflammation. Laboratory (including 
      microbiological) investigations are of limited use for diagnosing infection, except 
      in cases of osteomyelitis (B-II). 6. Send appropriately obtained specimens for 
      culture before starting empirical antibiotic therapy in all cases of infection, 
      except perhaps those that are mild and previously untreated (B-III). Tissue 
      specimens obtained by biopsy, ulcer curettage, or aspiration are preferable to wound 
      swab specimens (A-I). 7. Imaging studies may help diagnose or better define deep, 
      soft-tissue purulent collections and are usually needed to detect pathological 
      findings in bone. Plain radiography may be adequate in many cases, but MRI (in 
      preference to isotope scanning) is more sensitive and specific, especially for 
      detection of soft-tissue lesions (A-I). 8. Infections should be categorized by their 
      severity on the basis of readily assessable clinical and laboratory features (B-II). 
      Most important among these are the specific tissues involved, the adequacy of 
      arterial perfusion, and the presence of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability. 
      Categorization helps determine the degree of risk to the patient and the limb and, 
      thus, the urgency and venue of management. 9. Available evidence does not support 
      treating clinically uninfected ulcers with antibiotic therapy (D-III). Antibiotic 
      therapy is necessary for virtually all infected wounds, but it is often insufficient 
      without appropriate wound care. 10. Select an empirical antibiotic regimen on the 
      basis of the severity of the infection and the likely etiologic agent(s) (B-II). 
      Therapy aimed solely at aerobic Gram-positive cocci may be sufficient for 
      mild-to-moderate infections in patients who have not recently received antibiotic 
      therapy (A-II). Broad-spectrum empirical therapy is not routinely required but is 
      indicated for severe infections, pending culture results and antibiotic 
      susceptibility data (B-III). Take into consideration any recent antibiotic therapy 
      and local antibiotic susceptibility data, especially the prevalence of 
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms. Definitive 
      therapy should be based on both the culture results and susceptibility data and the 
      clinical response to the empirical regimen (C-III). 11. There is only limited 
      evidence with which to make informed choices among the various topical, oral, and 
      parenteral antibiotic agents. Virtually all severe and some moderate infections 
      require parenteral therapy, at least initially (C-III). Highly bioavailable oral 
      antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections, including some 
      cases of osteomyelitis (A-II). Topical therapy may be used for some mild superficial 
      infections (B-I). 12. Continue antibiotic therapy until there is evidence that the 
      infection has resolved but not necessarily until a wound has healed. Suggestions for 
      the duration of antibiotic therapy are as follows: for mild infections, 12 weeks 
      usually suffices, but some require an additional 12 weeks; for moderate and severe 
      infections, usually 24 weeks is sufficient, depending on the structures involved, 
      the adequacy of debridement, the type of soft-tissue wound cover, and wound 
      vascularity (A-II); and for osteomyelitis, generally at least 46 weeks is required, 
      but a shorter duration is sufficient if the entire infected bone is removed, and 
      probably a longer duration is needed if infected bone remains (B-II). 13. If an 
      infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to 1 antibiotic courses, 
      consider discontinuing all antimicrobials and, after a few days, obtaining optimal 
      culture specimens (C-III). 14. Seek surgical consultation and, when needed, 
      intervention for infections accompanied by a deep abscess, extensive bone or joint 
      involvement, crepitus, substantial necrosis or gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis 
      (A-II). Evaluating the limb's arterial supply and revascularizing when indicated are 
      particularly important. Surgeons with experience and interest in the field should be 
      recruited by the foot-care team, if possible. 15. Providing optimal wound care, in 
      addition to appropriate antibiotic treatment of the infection, is crucial for 
      healing (A-I). This includes proper wound cleansing, debridement of any callus and 
      necrotic tissue, and, especially, off-loading of pressure. There is insufficient 
      evidence to recommend use of a specific wound dressing or any type of wound healing 
      agents or products for infected foot wounds. 16. Patients with infected wounds 
      require early and careful follow-up observation to ensure that the selected medical 
      and surgical treatment regimens have been appropriate and effective (B-III). 17. 
      Studies have not adequately defined the role of most adjunctive therapies for 
      diabetic foot infections, but systematic reviews suggest that granulocyte 
      colony-stimulating factors and systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help prevent 
      amputations (B-I). These treatments may be useful for severe infections or for those 
      that have not adequately responded to therapy, despite correcting for all amenable 
      local and systemic adverse factors. 18. Spread of infection to bone (osteitis or 
      osteomyelitis) may be difficult to distinguish from noninfectious osteoarthropathy. 
      Clinical examination and imaging tests may suffice, but bone biopsy is valuable for 
      establishing the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, for defining the pathogenic 
      organism(s), and for determining the antibiotic susceptibilities of such organisms 
      (B-II). 19. Although this field has matured, further research is much needed. The 
      committee especially recommends that adequately powered prospective studies be 
      undertaken to elucidate and validate systems for classifying infection, diagnosing 
      osteomyelitis, defining optimal antibiotic regimens in various situations, and 
      clarifying the role of surgery in treating osteomyelitis (A-III).

TI  - Dorsal root ganglia in vivo morphometry and perfusion in female patients with Fabry 
      disease.
PG  - 2723-2729
LID - 10.1007/s00415-018-9053-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine dorsal root ganglia and the proximal nerve segments in female 
      patients with Fabry disease by functional and morphometric magnetic resonance 
      neurography. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study the lumbosacral dorsal 
      root ganglia and proximal sciatic nerve were examined in ten female patients with 
      Fabry disease by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3 T. 
      Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3-S2, permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1 
      and the spinal nerve L5 as well as the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic 
      nerve were compared to 16 gender-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Dorsal root 
      ganglia were symmetrically enlarged by 54% (L3), 79% (L4), 60% (L5), 94% (S1), and 
      106% (S2) (p < 0.001). Additionally, permeability of the blood-tissue interface was 
      decreased by 47% (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the peripheral 
      zone of the dorsal root ganglia, where the cell bodies of the primary sensory 
      neurons are located (p < 0.001). While spinal nerve permeability showed no 
      differences compared to healthy controls, proximal sciatic nerve cross-sectional 
      area was mildly increased by 6% (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Although heterozygous, Fabry 
      females show severe enlarged dorsal root ganglia with a concomitant dysfunctional 
      perfusion, even in patients with minor disease progression and in patients who are 
      not considered for enzyme replacement therapy yet. Alterations in dorsal root 
      ganglia volume and perfusion might serve as a very early in vivo marker for 
      involvement of the peripheral nervous system in Fabry disease, even in patients with 
      residual enzyme activity.

TI  - Anatomical measurements correlate with individual magnetostimulation thresholds for 
      kHz-range homogeneous magnetic fields.
PG  - 1836-1844
LID - 10.1002/mp.14032 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Magnetostimulation, also known as peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), is 
      the dominant safety constraint in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the gradient 
      magnetic fields that operate around 0.1-1 kHz, and for the homogeneous drive field 
      in magnetic particle imaging (MPI) that operates around 10-150 kHz. Previous studies 
      did not report correlations between anatomical measures and magnetostimulation 
      thresholds for the gradient magnetic fields in MRI. In contrast, a strong linear 
      correlation was shown between the thresholds and the inverse of body part size in 
      MPI. Yet, the effects of other anatomical measures on the thresholds for the drive 
      field remain unexplored. Here, we investigate the effects of fat percentage on 
      magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range homogeneous magnetic fields such as the 
      drive field in MPI, with the ultimate goal of predicting subject-specific thresholds 
      based on simple anatomical measures. METHODS: Human subject experiments were 
      performed on the upper arms of 10 healthy male subjects (age: 26 ± 2 yr) to 
      determine magnetostimulation thresholds. Experiments were repeated three times for 
      each subject, with brief resting periods between repetitions. Using a solenoidal 
      magnetostimulation coil, a homogeneous magnetic field at 25 kHz with 100 ms pulse 
      duration was applied at 4-s intervals, while the subject reported stimulation via a 
      mouse click. To determine the thresholds, individual subject responses were fitted 
      to a cumulative distribution function modeled by a sigmoid curve. Next, anatomical 
      images of the upper arms of the subjects were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner. A 
      two-point Dixon method was used to obtain separate images of water and fat tissues, 
      from which several anatomical measures were derived: the effective outer radius of 
      the upper arm, the effective inner radius (i.e., the muscle radius), and fat 
      percentage. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship 
      between the threshold and anatomical measures. This statistical analysis was 
      repeated after factoring out the expected effects of body part size. An updated 
      model for threshold prediction is provided, where in addition to scaling in 
      proportion with the inverse of the outer radius, the threshold has an affine 
      dependence on fat percentage. RESULTS: A strong linear correlation (r = 0.783, 
      P < 0.008) was found between magnetostimulation threshold and fat percentage, and 
      the correlation became stronger after factoring out the effects of outer radius 
      (r = 0.839, P < 0.003). While considering body part size alone did not explain any 
      significant variance in measured thresholds (P > 0.398), the updated model that also 
      incorporates fat percentage yielded substantially improved threshold predictions 
      with R2  = 0.654 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This work shows for the first time that 
      fat percentage strongly correlates with magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range 
      homogenous magnetic fields such as the drive field in MPI, and that the correlations 
      get even stronger after factoring out the effects of body part size. These results 
      have important practical implications for predicting subject-specific thresholds, 
      which in turn can increase the performance of the drive field and improve image 
      quality while remaining within the safety limits.

AB  - OBJECT Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) are uncommon but bear a significant 
      risk of malignancy. High-resolution MRI is the standard technique for characterizing 
      PNSTs. However, planning the appropriate extent of resection and subsequent 
      reconstructive strategies is highly dependent on the intraoperative findings because 
      preoperative MRI evaluation can be insufficient. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) 
      represents a recently developed advanced MRI technique that reveals the 
      microstructure of tissues based on monitoring the random movement of water 
      molecules. DTT has the potential to provide diagnostic insights beyond conventional 
      MRI techniques due to its mapping of specific fibrillar nerve structures. Here, DTT 
      was applied to evaluate PNSTs and to examine the usefulness of this method for the 
      correct delineation of tumor and healthy nerve tissue and the value of this 
      information in the preoperative planning of surgical interventions. METHODS In this 
      prospective study, patients with the clinical symptoms of a PNST were investigated 
      using DTT 3-Tesla MRI scans. Image data processing and tractography were performed 
      using the FACT (fiber assessment by continuous tracking) algorithm and 
      multiple-regions-of-interest approach. The surgical findings were then compared with 
      the results of the DTT MRI scans. Preoperative fascicle visualization and the 
      correlation with the intraoperative findings were graded. RESULTS In a 21-month 
      period, 12 patients with PNSTs were investigated (7 female and 5 male patients with 
      a mean age of 46.2 ± 19.2 years). All patients underwent surgical removal of the 
      tumor. Schwannoma was the most common benign histopathological finding (n = 7), 
      whereas 2 malignant lesions were detected. In 10 of 12 patients, good preoperative 
      nerve fascicle visualization was achieved using DTT scans. In 9 of 10 patients with 
      good preoperative fascicle visualization, good intraoperative correlation between 
      the DTT scans and surgical anatomy was found. CONCLUSIONS DTT properly visualizes 
      the peripheral nerve fascicles and their correct anatomical relation to PNST. DTT 
      represents a promising new method for the preinterventional planning of nerve tumor 
      resection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of a biofabrication nerve scaffold, which mimics the nerve 
      microstructure, as an alternative for autologous nerve transplantation is a 
      promising strategy for treating peripheral nerve defects. This study aimed to design 
      a customized biofabrication scaffold model with the characteristics of human 
      peripheral nerve fascicles. METHODS: We used Micro-MRI technique to obtain different 
      nerve fascicles. A full-length 28 cm tibial nerve specimen was obtained and was 
      divided into 14 two-centimetre nerve segments. 3D models of the nerve fascicles were 
      obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction after image segmentation. The central 
      line of the nerve fascicles was fitted, and the aggregation of nerve fascicles was 
      analysed quantitatively. The nerve scaffold was designed by simulating the clinical 
      nerve defect and extracting information from the acquired nerve fascicle data; the 
      scaffold design was displayed by 3D printing to verify the accuracy of the model. 
      RESULT: The microstructure of the sciatic nerve, tibial nerve, and common peroneal 
      nerve in the nerve fascicles could be obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction. 
      The number of cross fusions of tibial nerve fascicles from proximal end to distal 
      end decreased gradually. By designing the nerve graft in accordance with the 
      microstructure of the nerve fascicles, the 3D printed model demonstrated that the 
      two ends of the nerve defect can be well matched. CONCLUSION: The microstructure of 
      the nerve fascicles is complicated and changeable, and the spatial position of each 
      nerve fascicle and the long segment of the nerve fascicle aggregation show great 
      changes at different levels. Under the premise of the stability of the existing 
      imaging techniques, a large number of scanning nerve samples can be used to set up a 
      three-dimensional database of the peripheral nerve fascicle microstructure, 
      integrating the gross imaging information, and provide a template for the design of 
      the downstream nerve graft model.

TI  - Effectiveness of preoperative facial nerve diffusion tensor imaging tractography for 
      preservation of facial nerve function in surgery for large vestibular schwannomas: 
      Results of a prospective randomized study.
PG  - 149-154
LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.253631 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of surgery in case of a large vestibular schwannoma is complete 
      excision of tumor and preservation of facial nerve function. The identification and 
      preservation of facial nerve is very difficult during surgery, particularly in case 
      of large tumors. This prospective randomized study was conducted to find out the 
      effectiveness of preoperative facial nerve diffusion tensor imaging tractography 
      (DTI) to predict location of the nerve and preservation of facial nerve function in 
      surgery for large vestibular schwannomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective 
      randomized study, we recruited 100 patients with a large vestibular schwannoma(> 
      3cm). After initial scrutiny, 94 patients were randomized based on a computer 
      generated chart. In group I, preoperative DTI was done and the operating surgeon was 
      informed about the position of facial nerve preoperatively. In group II, DTI was not 
      done. The facial nerve preservation rates and clinical outcome at follow up was 
      compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Out of 94 patients, there were 47 patients 
      in group I (DTI group) and 47 patients in group II (Non DTI group). In DTI group, 40 
      patients were left for comparison after the exclusion criteria was applied. 
      Preoperative DTI predicted that the facial nerve position was concordant with its 
      intraoperative position in 39 patients (97.5% concordance). Facial nerve 
      preservation rates were statistically significant in group I (DTI group) (P value = 
      0.002). CONCLUSION: The study establishes the role of preoperative DTI tractography 
      for better facial nerve preservation in surgery for large vestibular schwannomas (>3 
      cm).

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of a major complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus 
      (T1DM) and a leading cause of blindness. Evidence of animal study has shown that it 
      is not only a microvasucular lesion of the eye, but also a neurodegeneration disease 
      of the visual system. However, the in vivo imaging evidence of axonal degeneration 
      in the diabetic optic nerve is scarce. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique has 
      been proved to be an effective tool to track the integrity of the nerve fibers in 
      the central nervous system. In this study, type 1 diabetes was induced by 
      intraperitoneally injecting a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) into 
      Sprague-Dawley rats. DTI combined with histological assessments was carried out on 
      the optic nerve to clarify the microstructural alterations underlying DTI indices 
      changes at 4 weeks (4 w), 8 weeks (8 w) and 12 weeks (12 w) after STZ induction. The 
      retinal changes were analyzed by pathological evaluations at 4 weeks (4 w) and 
      12 weeks (12 w) after STZ induction. DTI results showed significantly decreased mean 
      diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (Da) in diabetic optic nerve compared to 
      controls at 12 w. Atrophy in diabetic nerves was monitored by high resolution 
      T(2)-weighted images. Axonal degeneration without myelin loss of the optic nerve was 
      confirmed by histological examination. Moreover, there are positive correlations 
      between decreased diffusivities (MD and Da) in the optic nerve and reduced total 
      axolemmal area. The diabetic rats showed intense glial activity since 4 w and 
      thinning of the thickness in inner plexiform layer and nerve fiber layer at 12 w in 
      the retina. In conclusion, DTI could in vivo monitor the progression of optic nerve 
      degeneration in diabetes and the findings in our study would help supply axonal 
      protection for DR in preclinical practice.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare diffusion tensor imaging using the local 
      look technique and sensitivity encoding for tractography of the periprostatic 
      neurovascular bundle. We compared the surrounding tissues of the prostate in eight 
      healthy volunteers. The results of tractography in terms of the numbers of fibers 
      and the fractional anisotropy map were evaluated. Distortion was evaluated using the 
      dice similarity coefficient between isotropic diffusion images created from 
      diffusion tensor images and T2-weighted images. The number of lines in tractography 
      was significantly greater in diffusion tensor imaging using the local look technique 
      (p < 0.001). Although there was no difference in image distortion of the prostate 
      between methods, an artifact appeared in the center of the diffusion tensor image 
      using sensitivity encoding. In conclusion, diffusion tensor imaging using the local 
      look technique was superior to that using sensitivity encoding for tractography of 
      the periprostatic neurovascular bundle.

TI  - A quantitative and clinical evaluation of nerve roots in lumbosacral radiculopathy 
      using diffusion tensor imaging.
PG  - 222-230
LID - 10.1007/s11604-019-00913-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) values of compressed nerves derived in diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) and the corresponding clinical symptoms for quantitative and clinical 
      evaluation in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy. METHODS: Thirty-six patients 
      and ten volunteers participated in the study and measured with DTI. The resultant FA 
      values for L5-S1 lumbar nerve roots were calculated at three sub-regions. 
      Additionally, the DTI relevant tractography was also performed on L4-S1 nerve roots. 
      Clinical symptoms were performed by Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scoring 
      for each patient and volunteer. RESULTS: The FA values of the nerves at the 
      symptomatic side were significantly lower than those at the asymptomatic side 
      (p < 0.001). Diffusion tensor tractography distinctly showed abnormalities in the 
      symptomatic nerve tracts. There was a significant correlation between JOA scores and 
      the FA values of the compressed nerves at middle and distal sub-regions (p < 0.005). 
      CONCLUSION: The clinical symptoms associated robustly with the DTI derived FA values 
      of the compressed nerves in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy. Therefore, the 
      FA values can be a potential clinical tool to evaluate the nerve roots in 
      lumbosacral radiculopathy quantitatively.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging MR neurography for the detection of polyneuropathy in type 
      1 diabetes.
PG  - 1125-1134
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25415 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate if diffusion tensor imaging MR neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect 
      lesions of peripheral nerves in patients with type 1 diabetes. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Eleven type 1 diabetic patients with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 type 1 
      diabetic patients without polyneuropathy (nDPN), and 10 healthy controls (HC) were 
      investigated with a 3T MRI scanner. Clinical examinations, nerve-conduction studies, 
      and vibratory-perception thresholds determined the presence of DPN. DTI-MRN (voxel 
      size: 1.4 × 1.4 × 3 mm(3) ; b-values: 0, 800 s/mm(2) ) covered proximal (sciatic 
      nerve) and distal regions of the lower extremity (tibial nerve). Fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated and 
      compared to T(2) -relaxometry and proton-spin density obtained from a multiecho 
      turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated DTI reproducibility, 
      repeatability, and diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: DTI-MRN could accurately 
      discriminate between DPN, nDPN, and HC. The proximal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 
      0.37 ± 0.06; nDPN 0.47 ± 0.03; HC 0.49 ± 0.06; P < 0.01). In addition, distal FA was 
      lowest in DPN (DPN 0.31 ± 0.05; nDPN 0.41 ± 0.07; HC 0.43 ± 0.08; P < 0.01). 
      Likewise, proximal ADC was highest in DPN (DPN 1.69 ± 0.25 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; nDPN 
      1.50 ± 0.06 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; HC 1.42 ± 0.12 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; P < 0.01) as was 
      distal ADC (DPN 1.87 ± 0.45 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; nDPN 1.59 ± 0.19 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; 
      HC 1.57 ± 0.26 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; P = 0.09). The combined interclass-correlation 
      (ICC) coefficient of DTI reproducibility and repeatability was high in the sciatic 
      nerve (ICC: FA = 0.86; ADC = 0.85) and the tibial nerve (ICC: FA = 0.78; 
      ADC = 0.66). T(2) -relaxometry and proton-spin-density did not enable detection of 
      neuropathy. CONCLUSION: DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher 
      ADC. These alterations are likely to reflect proximal and distal nerve fiber 
      pathology. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2017;45:1125-1134.

TI  - Nerve Ultrasonography as an Additive Tool to Clinical Examination and 
      Electrodiagnostics in Sporadic Mononeuritis - Imaging is the Key.
PG  - 465-472
LID - 10.1055/a-0919-4768 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE:  Sporadic mononeuropathies without trauma or compression are challenging to 
      diagnose. Nerve ultrasound has recently proven its usefulness in the diagnosis of 
      traumatic neuropathies, tumors and polyneuropathies. However, its role in 
      mononeuropathies currently remains unclear. We describe ultrasonography follow-up 
      results in 12 patients with suggested spontaneous, monophasic mononeuritis without 
      signs of generalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Nerve conduction studies (NCS), 
      ultrasonography of the affected nerves and the contralateral side, laboratory 
      analysis, and if possible magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected nerves 
      were established in all patients at onset. In one patient, additive nerve biopsy was 
      performed. In all patients, ultrasonography was repeated after immunotherapy. 
      RESULTS:  An infectious pathogen of neuritis was not found in any patient. All but 
      one patient showed predominant axonal nerve damage in NCS, whereas ultrasonography 
      and MRI revealed fascicular and/or overall cross-sectional area (CSA) enlargement or 
      T2 hyperintensity of the affected nerve segments, suggesting an inflammatory 
      background of the neuropathy. Most patients showed significant clinical amelioration 
      of symptoms under treatment (75.0 %) and consequently a decrease in CSA/fascicle 
      enlargement over time (77.8 %). CONCLUSION:  Ultrasonography and MRI of the nerves 
      revealed enlargement in patients with mononeuropathy of axonal NCS pattern of 
      unknown origin. Ultrasonography can facilitate the therapeutic decision for 
      immunotherapy. Next to nerve trauma, nerve tumors and nerve entrapments, 
      ultrasonography reliably shows nerve enlargement in the case of inflammation and 
      therefore could further enrich neurophysiology. Nerve imaging might serve as a 
      follow-up tool by observing a decrease in nerve enlargement and improved function.

TI  - Prospective respiratory triggering improves high-resolution brachial plexus MRI 
      quality.
PG  - 1723-1729
LID - 10.1002/jmri.26559 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oblique sagittal MRI sequences, orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of 
      the brachial plexus, can reliably depict morphologic and signal abnormalities. 
      However, nerve visualization may be obscured by ghosting artifact from periodic 
      respiratory motion. Respiratory triggering (RT) with a thoracoabdominal bellows can 
      reduce ghosting artifact, but it is not routinely used for brachial plexus MRI. 
      Furthermore, the efficacy of prospective RT for brachial plexus imaging has not yet 
      been reported. PURPOSE: To compare brachial plexus MRI sequences acquired with and 
      without respiratory triggering. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. SUBJECTS: Five volunteers 
      and 20 patients were included. Each subject was imaged with and without RT during 
      the same session. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Proton density or T(2) -weighted Dixon 
      fat suppressed sequences were obtained at 3.0T using receive-only 16-channel 
      flexible array coils. ASSESSMENT: Three musculoskeletal radiologists blindly 
      evaluated each sequence using subjective scoring criteria for ghosting artifact, 
      nerve conspicuity, and diagnostic confidence. Nerve conspicuity scores at three 
      distinct plexus levels were summed to calculate an overall image quality score. 
      STATISTICAL TESTS: Marginal proportional odds logistic regression models were used 
      to compare all scores between RT and non-RT. Gwet's agreement coefficient was used 
      to assess interobserver and intraobserver reliability. RESULTS: Mean scan time per 
      sequence increased from 4:25 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI], 4:02-4:49 min) 
      with non-RT to 6:09 minutes (95% CI, 5:42-6:35 min) with RT. RT reduced ghosting 
      artifact (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.09-0.46, P < 0.001), improved overall 
      image quality (OR = 4.88, 95% CI: 2.18-10.95, P < 0.001), and increased diagnostic 
      confidence (OR = 3.72, 95% CI: 1.61-8.63, P = 0.002) for all readers. Interobserver 
      agreement for ghosting artifact and image quality was substantial to almost perfect 
      (AC(2)  = 0.74-0.85). Interobserver agreement for all other scores was moderate to 
      almost perfect (AC(2)  = 0.61-0.82). Intraobserver agreement was substantial to 
      almost perfect for all parameters (AC(2)  = 0.76-1.0). DATA CONCLUSION: Prospective 
      RT with bellows can effectively minimize ghosting artifact and improve image quality 
      for brachial plexus MRI within clinically optimal acquisition times. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2.

TI  - Thyroid-Associated Orbitopathy: Evaluating Microstructural Changes of Extraocular 
      Muscles and Optic Nerves Using Readout-Segmented Echo-Planar Imaging-Based Diffusion 
      Tensor Imaging.
PG  - 332-340
LID - 10.3348/kjr.2019.0053 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the ability of readout-segmented echo-planar 
      imaging (rs-EPI)-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing the 
      microstructural change of extraocular muscles (EOMs) and optic nerves in patients 
      with thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO) as well as in evaluating disease activity. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 35 TAO patients and 22 healthy controls (HCs) who 
      underwent pre-treatment rs-EPI-based DTI. Mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, 
      AD, and RD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the medial and lateral EOMs and optic 
      nerve for each orbit were calculated and compared between TAO and HC groups and 
      between active and inactive TAO groups. Factors such as age, sex, disease duration, 
      mediation, and smoking history between groups were also compared. Logistic 
      regression analysis was used to evaluate the predictive value of significant 
      variables for disease activity. RESULTS: Disease duration was significantly shorter 
      in active TAOs than in inactive ones (p < 0.001). TAO patients showed significantly 
      lower FA and higher MD, AD, and RD than HCs for both medial and lateral EOMs (p < 
      0.001), but not the AD value of lateral EOMs (p = 0.619). Active patients had 
      significantly higher FA, MD, and AD than inactive patients for medial EOMs (p < 
      0.005), whereas only FA differed significantly in the lateral EOMs (p = 0.018). The 
      MD, AD, and RD of optic nerves were significantly lower in TAO patients than HCs (p 
      < 0.05), except for FA (p = 0.129). Multivariate analysis showed that the MD of 
      medial EOMs and disease duration were significant predictors for disease activity. 
      The combination of these two parameters showed optimal diagnostic efficiency for 
      disease activity (area under the curve, 0.855; sensitivity, 68.4%; specificity, 
      96.9%). CONCLUSION: rs-EPI-based DTI is promising in assessing microstructural 
      changes of EOMs and optic nerves and can help to indicate the disease activity of 
      TAO, especially through the MD of medial EOMs.

TI  - Sural nerve injury in familial amyloid polyneuropathy: MR neurography vs 
      clinicopathologic tools.
PG  - 475-484
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000004178 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect and quantify lesions of the small-caliber sural nerve (SN) in 
      symptomatic and asymptomatic transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) 
      by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in correlation with 
      electrophysiologic and histopathologic findings. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with 
      TTR-FAP, 10 asymptomatic carriers of the mutated transthyretin gene (mutTTR), and 35 
      age- and sex-matched healthy controls were prospectively included in this 
      cross-sectional case-control study. All participants underwent 3T MRN with 
      high-structural resolution (fat-saturated, T2-weighted, and double-echo sequences). 
      Total imaging time was ≈45 minutes per patient. Manual SN segmentation was performed 
      from its origin at the sciatic nerve bifurcation to the lower leg with subsequent 
      evaluation of quantitative microstructural and morphometric parameters. Additional 
      time needed for postprocessing was ≈1.5 hours per participant. Detailed neurologic 
      and electrophysiologic examinations were conducted in the TTR group. RESULTS: T2 
      signal and proton spin density (ρ) reliably differentiated between TTR-FAP (198.0 ± 
      13.3, 429.6 ± 15.25), mutTTR carriers (137.0 ± 16.9, p = 0.0009; 354.7 ± 21.64, p = 
      0.0029), and healthy controls (90.0 ± 3.4, 258.2 ± 9.10; p < 0.0001). Marked 
      differences between mutTTR carriers and controls were found for T2 signal (p = 
      0.0065) and ρ (p < 0.0001). T2 relaxation time was higher in patients with TTR-FAP 
      only (p = 0.015 vs mutTTR carriers, p = 0.0432 vs controls). SN caliber was higher 
      in patients with TTR-FAP vs controls and in mutTTR carriers vs controls (p < 
      0.0001). Amyloid deposits were histopathologically detectable in 10 of 14 SN 
      specimens. CONCLUSIONS: SN injury in TTR-FAP is detectable and quantifiable in vivo 
      by MRN even in asymptomatic mutTTR carriers. Differences in SN T2 signal between 
      controls and asymptomatic mutTTR carriers are derived mainly from an increase of ρ, 
      which overcomes typical limitations of established diagnostic methods as a highly 
      sensitive imaging biomarker for early detection of peripheral nerve lesions. 
      CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that MRN 
      accurately identifies asymptomatic mutTTR carriers.

TI  - Feasibility of quantitative ultrashort echo time (UTE)-based methods for MRI of 
      peripheral nerve.
PG  - e3948
LID - 10.1002/nbm.3948 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral nerves are a composite tissue consisting of neurovascular elements 
      packaged within a well-organized extracellular matrix. Their composition, size, and 
      anatomy render nerves a challenging medical imaging target. In contrast to 
      morphological MRI, which represents the predominant approach to nerve imaging, 
      quantitative MRI sequences can provide information regarding tissue composition. 
      Here, we applied standard clinical Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) and experimental 
      three-dimensional (3D) ultrashort echo time (UTE) Cones sequences for quantitative 
      nerve imaging including T(2) measurement with single-component analysis, T(2) * 
      measurement with single-component and bi-component analyses, and magnetization 
      transfer ratio (MTR) analysis. We demonstrated the feasibility and the high quality 
      of single-component T(2) *, bi-component T(2) *, and MTR approaches to analyze 
      nerves imaged with clinically deployed 3D UTE Cones pulse sequences. For 24 single 
      fascicles from eight nerves, we measured a mean single-component T(2) * of 22.6 
      ±8.9 ms, and a short T(2) * component (STC) with a mean T(2) * of 1.7 ±1.0 ms and a 
      mean fraction of (6.74 ±4.31)% in bi-component analysis. For eight whole nerves, we 
      measured a mean single-component T(2) * of 16.7 ±2.2 ms, and an STC with a mean T(2) 
      * of 3.0 ±1.0 ms and a mean fraction of (15.56 ±7.07)% in bi-component analysis. For 
      nine fascicles from three healthy nerves, we measured a mean MTR of (25.2 ±1.9)% for 
      single fascicles and a mean MTR of (23.6 ±0.9)% for whole nerves. No statistically 
      significant correlation was observed between any MRI parameter and routine 
      histological outcomes, perhaps due to the small sample size and lack of apparent 
      sample pathology. Overall, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of 
      measuring quantitative MR outcomes ex vivo, which might reflect features of nerve 
      structure and macromolecular content. These methods should be validated 
      comprehensively on a larger and more diverse set of nerve samples, towards the 
      interpretation of in vivo outcomes. These approaches have new and broad implications 
      for the management of nerve disease, injury, and repair.

TI  - 4.7-T diffusion tensor imaging of acute traumatic peripheral nerve injury.
PG  - E9
LID - 10.3171/2015.6.FOCUS1590 [doi]
AB  - Diagnosis and management of peripheral nerve injury is complicated by the inability 
      to assess microstructural features of injured nerve fibers via clinical examination 
      and electrophysiology. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to accurately 
      detect nerve injury and regeneration in crush models of peripheral nerve injury, but 
      no prior studies have been conducted on nerve transection, a surgical emergency that 
      can lead to permanent weakness or paralysis. Acute sciatic nerve injuries were 
      performed microsurgically to produce multiple grades of nerve transection in rats 
      that were harvested 1 hour after surgery. High-resolution diffusion tensor images 
      from ex vivo sciatic nerves were obtained using diffusion-weighted spin-echo 
      acquisitions at 4.7 T. Fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced at the injury 
      sites of transected rats compared with sham rats. Additionally, minor eigenvalues 
      and radial diffusivity were profoundly elevated at all injury sites and were 
      negatively correlated to the degree of injury. Diffusion tensor tractography showed 
      discontinuities at all injury sites and significantly reduced continuous tract 
      counts. These findings demonstrate that high-resolution DTI is a promising tool for 
      acute diagnosis and grading of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study explores whether objective, quantitative radiomic biomarkers 
      derived from magnetic resonance (MR), positron emission tomography (PET), and 
      computed tomography (CT) may be useful in reliably distinguishing malignant 
      peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN). 
      METHODS: A registration and segmentation pipeline was established using a cohort of 
      NF1 patients with histopathological diagnosis of PN or MPNST, and medical imaging of 
      the PN including MR and PET-CT. The corrected MR datasets were registered to the 
      corresponding PET-CT via landmark-based registration. PET standard-uptake value 
      (SUV) thresholds were used to guide segmentation of volumes of interest: 
      MPNST-associated PET-hot regions (SUV≥3.5) and PN-associated PET-elevated regions 
      (2.0<SUV<3.5). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from the MR, PET, and CT 
      data and compared for statistical differences. Intensity histogram features included 
      (mean, media, maximum, variance, full width at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and 
      skewness), while image texture was quantified using Law's texture energy measures, 
      grey-level co-occurrence matrices, and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices. 
      RESULTS: For each of the 20 NF1 subjects, a total of 320 features were extracted 
      from the image data. Feature reduction and statistical testing identified 9 
      independent radiomic biomarkers from the MR data (4 intensity and 5 texture) and 4 
      PET (2 intensity and 2 texture) were different between the PET-hot versus 
      PET-elevated volumes of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests imaging features 
      can be used to distinguish malignancy in NF1-realted tumors, which could improve 
      MPNST risk assessment and positively impact clinical management of NF1 patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence for the involvement of cerebrovascular 
      factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate retinal and optic nerve 
      head perfusion in patients with AD using optical coherence tomography angiography 
      (OCTA), and to analyze the correlations of quantitative OCTA metrics with AD 
      pathology and vascular cerebral lesions in AD patients. METHODS: 36 eyes of 36 
      patients with AD (study group) and 38 eyes of 38 healthy subjects (control group) 
      were prospectively included in this study. OCTA was performed using RTVue XR Avanti 
      with AngioVue. In addition, patients underwent a detailed ophthalmological and 
      neurological examination including Mini-Mental State Examination, cerebral magnetic 
      resonance imaging, and amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau levels in the cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF). RESULTS: The flow density in the superficial retinal OCT angiogram of the 
      macula in the study group was significantly lower compared to the control group 
      (p = 0.001). There was a significant correlation between the flow density in the 
      superficial retinal OCT angiogram of the macula, as measured using OCTA, and the 
      Fazekas scale (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.520; p = 0.003). There was no 
      significant correlation between the Aβ or tau levels in the CSF and the flow density 
      data. CONCLUSION: Patients with AD showed a reduced flow density in the radial 
      peripapillary capillaries layer and in the superficial retinal OCT angiogram when 
      compared with healthy controls. The reduced retinal flow density measured using OCTA 
      is not specifically associated with AD pathology but is associated with the vascular 
      cerebral lesions in AD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The neurofibromatoses (NF) type 1 and 2 are hereditary tumor 
      predisposition syndromes caused by germline mutations in the NF1 and NF2 tumor 
      suppressor genes. In NF1 and 2, peripheral nerve tumors occur regularly. For further 
      characterizing nerve ultrasound was performed in patients with NF1 and 2. METHODS: 
      Patients with established diagnosis of NF1 (n=27) and NF2 (n=10) were included. 
      Ultrasound of peripheral nerves and cervical roots was performed during routine 
      follow-up visits. Healthy volunteers were studied for comparison. RESULTS: In 
      patients with NF1, median cross-sectional area (CSA) of most nerves was 
      significantly increased compared to controls and to NF2 due to generalized plexiform 
      tumors, which arose out of multiple fascicles in 23 of 27 patients (85%). These were 
      often accompanied by cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas. In NF2, the overall 
      aspect of peripheral nerves consisted of localized schwannomas (80%) and, apart from 
      that, normal nerve segments. CONCLUSION: Nerve ultrasound is able to visualize 
      different nerve pathologies in NF1 and NF2. It is a precise and inexpensive 
      screening method for peripheral nerve manifestation in neurofibromatosis and should 
      be considered as the first choice screening imaging modality for all peripheral 
      nerves within reach of non-invasive ultrasound techniques. SIGNIFICANCE: Ultrasound 
      patterns of peripheral nerve pathologies are described for the first time in a large 
      cohort of patients with NF1 and NF2. It is a suitable screening tool and enables 
      targeted MRI analysis.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging for Diagnosing Root Avulsions in Traumatic Adult Brachial 
      Plexus Injuries: A Proof-of-Concept Study.
PG  - 19

LID - 19
AB  - Cross-sectional MRI has modest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing traumatic brachial 
      plexus root avulsions. Consequently, patients either undergo major exploratory 
      surgery or months of surveillance to determine if and what nerve reconstruction is 
      needed. This study aimed to develop a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol at 3 
      Tesla to visualize normal roots and identify traumatic root avulsions of the 
      brachial plexus. Seven healthy adults and 12 adults with known (operatively 
      explored) unilateral traumatic brachial plexus root avulsions were scanned. DTI was 
      acquired using a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence at 3 Tesla. The brachial 
      plexus was visualized by deterministic tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and 
      mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated for injured and avulsed roots in the lateral 
      recesses of the vertebral foramen. Compared to healthy nerves roots, the FA of 
      avulsed nerve roots was lower (mean difference 0.1 [95% CI 0.07, 0.13]; p < 0.001) 
      and the MD was greater (mean difference 0.32 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s [95% CI 0.11, 0.53]; p 
      < 0.001). Deterministic tractography reconstructed both normal roots and root 
      avulsions of the brachial plexus; the negative-predictive value for at least one 
      root avulsion was 100% (95% CI 78, 100). Therefore, DTI might help visualize both 
      normal and injured roots of the brachial plexus aided by tractography. The precision 
      of this technique and how it relates to neural microstructure will be further 
      investigated in a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of patients with acute 
      brachial plexus injuries.

AB  - PURPOSE: While standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are increasingly 
      employed in post-mortem (PM) examinations, more advanced techniques such as 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) remain unexplored in forensic sciences. Therefore, we 
      studied the temporal stability and reproducibility of DTI and fiber tractography 
      (FT) in non-fixed PM subjects. In addition, we investigated the lumbosacral nerves 
      with PMDTI and compared their tissue characteristics to in vivo findings. METHODS: 
      MRI data were acquired on a 1.5T MRI scanner in seven PM subjects, consisting of six 
      non-trauma deaths and one chronic trauma death, and in six living subjects. 
      Inter-scan (within one session) and inter-session (between days) reproducibility of 
      diffusion parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD), were 
      evaluated for the lumbosacral nerves using Bland-Altman and Jones plots. Diffusion 
      parameters in nerves L3-S2 were compared to living subjects using the non-parametric 
      Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Reproducibility of diffusion values of inter-scan 95% 
      limits of agreement ranged from -0.058 to 0.062 for FA, and (-0.037 to 
      0.052)×10(-3)mm(2)/s for MD. For the inter-session this was -0.0423 to 0.0423, and 
      (-0.0442 to 0.0442)×10(-3)mm(2)/s for FA, and MD, respectively. Although PM subjects 
      showed approximately four-fold lower diffusivity values compared to living subjects, 
      FT results were comparable. The chronic trauma case showed disorganization and 
      asymmetry of the nerves. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that DTI was reproducible in 
      characterizing nervous tissue properties and FT in reconstructing the architecture 
      of lumbosacral nerves in PM subjects. We showed differences in diffusion values 
      between PM and in vivo and showed the ability of PMDTI and FT to reconstruct nerve 
      lesions in a chronic trauma case. We expect that PMDTI and FT may become valuable in 
      identification and documentation of PM nerve trauma or pathologies in forensic 
      sciences.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Tibial and Common Peroneal Nerves in Patients With 
      Guillain-Barre Syndrome: A Feasibility Study.
PG  - 1356-1364
LID - 10.1002/jmri.26324 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of a noninvasive, objective, and accurate method to 
      assess peripheral nerve disorders in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is of clinical 
      significance. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to evaluate some 
      peripheral nerve disorders. PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of DTI in 
      evaluating the peripheral nerve disorders in patients with GBS. STUDY TYPE: Case 
      control. SUBJECTS: Twenty GBS patients and 16 healthy volunteers. FIELD 
      STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T, T(1) WI-SE, T(2) WI-SPAIR, DTI; electrophysiology. 
      ASSESSMENT: MRI data were analyzed by two radiologists blindly and independently. 
      Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusion 
      coefficient (AD), and radial diffusion coefficient (RD) values of tibial nerve (TN) 
      and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were recorded. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) 
      and motor nerve conduction amplitude of TN and CPN were recorded. STATISTICAL TESTS: 
      Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), t-test, receiver-operating characteristic 
      (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC) analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient. 
      RESULTS: The FA and AD values of TN and CPN in the GBS group were significantly 
      lower and the ADC and RD values were higher than those in the controls (P <0.05). 
      The AUC of the FA values (0.970 for TN and 0.927 for CPN) were higher than that of 
      the ADC, AD, and RD values. FA and AD values were positively correlated and ADC, RD 
      values were negatively correlated with MCV and motor nerve conduction amplitude, 
      respectively (P <0.05). The correlations between FA value and electrophysiology 
      parameters were the highest. DATA CONCLUSION: DTI quantitative parameters could 
      evaluate the disorders of peripheral nerves in patients with GBS. A moderate 
      correlation was observed between DTI and electrophysiology parameters. LEVEL OF

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is histological evidence of microstructural changes in the 
      zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve in migraineurs. This raises the 
      possibility that altered trigeminal nerve properties contribute to migraine 
      pathophysiology. Whilst it is not possible to explore the anatomy of small 
      trigeminal nerve branches it is possible to explore the anatomy of the trigeminal 
      root entry zone using magnetic resonance imaging in humans. The aim of this 
      investigation is to assess the microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in vivo to 
      determine if nerve alterations occur in individuals with episodic migraine. METHODS: 
      In 39 migraineurs and 39 matched controls, T1-weighted anatomical images were used 
      to calculate the volume (mm(3)) and maximal cross-sectional area of the trigeminal 
      nerve root entry zone; diffusion tensor images were used to calculate fractional 
      anisotropy, mean diffusion, axial diffusion and radial diffusion. RESULTS: There 
      were significant differences between the left and right nerve of controls and 
      migraineurs with respect to volume and not cross-sectional area. Migraineurs 
      displayed reduced axial diffusion in the right nerve compared to the left nerve, and 
      reduced fractional anisotropy in the left nerve compared to left controls. 
      Furthermore, although there were no differences in mean diffusion or radial 
      diffusion, regional analysis of the nerve revealed significantly greater radial 
      diffusion in the middle and rostral portion of the left trigeminal nerve in 
      migraineurs compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine pathophysiology is 
      associated with microstructural abnormalities within the trigeminal nerve that are 
      consistent with histological evidence of altered myelin and/or organization. These 
      peripheral nerve changes may provide further insight into migraine pathophysiology 
      and enable a greater understanding for targeted treatments of pain alleviation.

AB  - Due to the technical challenges of large-scale microscopy and analysis, to date only 
      limited knowledge has been made available about axon morphometry (diameter, shape, 
      myelin thickness, volume fraction), thereby limiting our understanding of neuronal 
      microstructure and slowing down research on neurodegenerative pathologies. This 
      study addresses this knowledge gap by establishing a state-of-the-art acquisition 
      and analysis framework for mapping axon morphometry, and providing the first 
      comprehensive mapping of axon morphometry in the human spinal cord. We dissected, 
      fixed and stained a human spinal cord with osmium tetroxide, and used a scanning 
      electron microscope to image the entirety of 23 axial slices, covering C1 to L5 
      spinal levels. An automatic method based on deep learning was then used to segment 
      each axon and myelin sheath to produce maps of axon morphometry. These maps were 
      then registered to a standard spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) template. 
      Between 500,000 (lumbar) and 1 million (cervical) myelinated axons were segmented at 
      each level of this human spinal cord. Morphometric features show a large disparity 
      between tracts, but high right-left symmetry. Our results suggest a modality-based 
      organization of the dorsal column in the human, as it has been observed in the rat. 
      The generated axon morphometry template is publicly available at 
      https://osf.io/8k7jr/ and could be used as a reference for quantitative MRI studies. 
      The proposed framework for axon morphometry mapping could be extended to other parts 
      of the central or peripheral nervous system that exhibit coherently-oriented axons.

TI  - Peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging as a measure of disease progression in 
      ALS.
PG  - 882-890
LID - 10.1007/s00415-017-8443-x [doi]
AB  - Clinical trial design in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains hampered by a 
      lack of reliable and sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. The present study 
      evaluated peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a surrogate marker of 
      axonal degeneration in ALS. Longitudinal studies were undertaken in 21 ALS patients 
      studied at 0 and 3 months, and 19 patients at 0, 3 and 6 months, with results 
      compared to 13 age-matched controls. Imaging metrics were correlated across a range 
      of functional assessments including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating 
      scale revised (ALSFRS-R), lower limb muscle strength (Medical Research Council sum 
      score, MRCSS-LL), compound muscle action potential amplitudes and motor unit number 
      estimation (MUNE). Fractional anisotropy was reduced at baseline in ALS patients in 
      the tibial (p < 0.05), and peroneal nerve (p < 0.05). Fractional anisotropy and 
      axial diffusivity declined in the tibial nerve between baselines, 3- and 6-month 
      scans (p < 0.01). From a functional perspective, ALSFRS-R correlated with fractional 
      anisotropy values from tibial (R = 0.75, p < 0.001) and peroneal nerves (R = 0.52, 
      p = 0.001). Similarly, peroneal nerve MUNE values correlated with fractional 
      anisotropy values from the tibial (R = 0.48, p = 0.002) and peroneal nerve 
      (R = 0.39, p = 0.01). There were correlations between the change in ALSFRS-R and 
      tibial nerve axial diffusivity (R = 0.38, p = 0.02) and the change in MRCSS-LL and 
      peroneal nerve fractional anisotropy (R = 0.44, p = 0.009). In conclusion, this 
      study has demonstrated that some peripheral nerve DTI metrics are sensitive to 
      axonal degeneration in ALS. Further, that DTI metrics correlated with measures of 
      functional disability, strength and neurophysiological measures of lower motor 
      neuron loss.

TI  - Peripheral neuropathy: detection with diffusion-tensor imaging.
PG  - 185-93
LID - 10.1148/radiol.14132837 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the ability of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 to help 
      detect the mildest nerve lesion conceivable, that is, subclinical ulnar neuropathy 
      at the elbow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the 
      institutional ethics board. Written informed consent was obtained from all 
      participants. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3.0 T by using proton 
      density- and T2-weighted relaxometry and DTI on elbows in 30 healthy subjects 
      without clinical evidence of neuropathy. Quantitative analysis of ulnar nerve T2 and 
      fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed, and T2 and FA values were correlated to 
      electrical nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) with Pearson correlation analysis. 
      Additional qualitative assessment of T2-weighted and FA images was performed by two 
      readers, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS: Ten of the 30 
      subjects (33%) had NCV slowing across the elbow segment. Compared with subjects 
      without NCV slowing, subjects with slowing had decreased FA values (0.51 ± 0.09 vs 
      0.41 ± 0.07, respectively; P = .006) and increased T2 values (64.2 msec ± 10.9 vs 
      76.2 msec ± 13.7, respectively; P = .01) in the proximal ulnar sulcus. FA values 
      showed a significant correlation (P = .01) with NCV slowing over the sulcus as an 
      electrophysiologic indicator of myelin sheath damage. Qualitative assessment of FA 
      maps and T2-weighted images helped identify subjects with conduction slowing with a 
      sensitivity of 80% and 55%, respectively, and a specificity of 83% and 63%. 
      CONCLUSION: FA maps can accurately depict even mild peripheral neuropathy and 
      perform better than the current standard of reference, T2-weighted images. DTI may 
      therefore add diagnostic value as a highly sensitive technique for the detection of 
      peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - Sensory-motor integration models have been proposed aiming to explain how the brain 
      uses sensory information to guide and check the planning and execution of movements. 
      Sensory neuronopathy (SN) is a peculiar disease characterized by exclusive, severe 
      and widespread sensory loss. It is a valuable condition to investigate how sensory 
      deafferentation impacts brain organization. We thus recruited patients with clinical 
      and electrophysiological criteria for SN to perform structural and functional MRI 
      analyses. We investigated volumetric changes in gray matter (GM) using anatomical 
      images; the microstructure of WM within segmented regions of interest (ROI), via 
      diffusion images; and brain activation related to a finger tapping task. All 
      significant results were related to the long disease duration subgroup of patients. 
      Structural analysis showed hypertrophy of the caudate nucleus, whereas the diffusion 
      study identified reduction of fractional anisotropy values in ROIs located around 
      the thalamus and the striatum. We also found differences regarding finger-tapping 
      activation in the posterior parietal regions and in the medial areas of the 
      cerebellum. Our results stress the role of the caudate nucleus over the other basal 
      ganglia in the sensory-motor integration models, and suggest an inhibitory function 
      of a recently discovered tract between the thalamus and the striatum. Overall, our 
      findings confirm plasticity in the adult brain and open new avenues to design 
      neurorehabilitation strategies.

TI  - A Comparison of Ultrasound and MRI Measurements of the Cross-Sectional Area of the 
      Median Nerve at the Wrist.
PG  - 746-750
LID - 10.1177/1558944718777833 [doi]
AB  - Background: Ultrasound (US) measurement of cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median 
      nerve has emerged as a viable alternative to electromyography/nerve conduction 
      studies (EMG/NCS) for diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The purpose of this 
      study is to compare CSA of the median nerve between US and MRI using current MRI and 
      US technology. The null hypothesis is there is no difference between US and MRI CSA 
      measurements. Methods: The study design was an observational cohort, enrolling 
      patients presenting to clinic with MRI of the wrist. Participants with clinical 
      signs and symptoms of CTS were excluded. The CSA measurements of the median nerve on 
      MRI T1-weighted axial images were performed by a hand fellow blinded to results of 
      US measurements, and US measurement of median nerve CSA was performed by a hand 
      fellowship trained surgeon blinded to results of the MRI measurements. Results were 
      analyzed via percent error, Pearson correlation, and t tests. Results: Twenty 
      participants were enrolled with mean age of 29.4 years. Four left wrists and 16 
      right wrists were measured. The US mean CSA of the median nerve was 6.8 mm(2) 
      (±2.330 mm(2)). The MRI mean CSA of the median nerve was 6.8 mm(2) (±2.153 mm(2)), P 
      = .442. Pearson correlation between modalities was 0.93, suggesting near-perfect 
      correlation. Mean percent error was 8.8%. Conclusions: Results of this study suggest 
      that US is an accurate method to measure CSA of the median nerve at the carpal 
      tunnel inlet. The mean difference between US and MRI was unlikely to be clinically 
      significant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We present a clinical, electrophysiological, sonographical and magnetic 
      resonance neurography (MRN) study examining the complementary role of two 
      neuroimaging methods of the peripheral nervous system for patients with chronic 
      inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Furthermore, we explore the 
      significance of cross-sectional area (CSA) increase through correlations with MRN 
      markers of nerve integrity. METHODS: A total of 108 nerve segments on the median, 
      ulnar, radial, tibial and fibular nerve, as well as the lumbar and cervical plexus 
      of 18 CIDP patients were examined with high-resonance nerve ultrasound (HRUS) and 
      MRN additionally to the nerve conduction studies. RESULTS: We observed a fair degree 
      of correlation of the CSA values for all nerves/nerve segments between the two 
      methods, with a low random error in Bland-Altman analysis (bias = HRUS-CSA - 
      MRN-CSA, -0.61 to -3.26 mm). CSA in HRUS correlated with the nerve T2-weighted (nT2) 
      signal increase as well as with diffusion tensor imaging parameters such as 
      fractional anisotropy, a marker of microstructural integrity. HRUS-CSA of the 
      interscalene brachial plexus correlated significantly with the MRN-CSA and nT2 
      signal of the L5 and S1 roots of the lumbar plexus. CONCLUSIONS: HRUS allows for 
      reliable CSA imaging of all peripheral nerves and the cervical plexus, and CSA 
      correlates with markers of nerve integrity. Imaging of proximal segments as well as 
      the estimation of nerve integrity require MRN as a complementary method.

      transfer.
PG  - 13-7
LID - 10.1002/mus.22240 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent imaging modality for 
      soft tissues. Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging is an MRI technique that is 
      sensitive to the bound protons of macromolecules and therefore can aid in the 
      assessment of nerve damage. METHODS: Measurements of the MT ratio (MTR), which 
      provides an index of the MT effects in tissues, were performed in the wrist and foot 
      of 5 volunteers. RESULTS: The MTR of foot (interdigital) nerves (22.2 ± 2.1%) was 
      smaller than that of the median nerve (41.1 ± 1.4%). No difference was observed 
      between MTR in muscles adjacent to foot nerves (46.0 ± 1.5%) and muscles adjacent to 
      the median nerve (44.2 ± 1.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study we demonstrate the 
      feasibility of measuring the MTR of foot nerves. The difference of MTR between 
      median and foot nerves indicates a difference in structure/composition. The MTR of 
      peripheral nerves may serve as a biomarker of nerve damage, collagen integrity, and 
      demyelination.

AB  - The assessment of human peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles by means of diffusion 
      tensor imaging and tractograpy has been a recent area of research. These techniques 
      have been successfully applied in both volunteers and patients, providing 
      non-invasively, quantitative microstructural parameters (mainly mean fractional 
      anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient) and offering a three-dimensional 
      visualization tool of nerves and muscles fibers. DTI and tractography may reveal 
      abnormalities that are beyond the resolution of conventional MR techniques and hence 
      open the way to potential clinical applications. In this article, we will first 
      summarize the current state of DTI and tractography in the evaluation of peripheral 
      nerves and skeletal muscles as well as their potential future clinical applications. 
      Then, we will address important technical considerations, which understanding is 
      necessary to appropriately apply DTI and tractograhy, and in order to understand the 
      current limitations of these innovative and promising techniques.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Tractrography Visualizes Partial Nerve Laceration Severity as Early 
      as 1 Week After Surgical Repair in a Rat Model Ex Vivo.
PG  - 35-41
LID - 10.1093/milmed/usz360 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that a magnetic 
      resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can differentiate 
      between crush and complete transection peripheral nerve injuries in a rat model ex 
      vivo. DTI measures the directionally dependent effect of tissue barriers on the 
      random diffusion of water molecules. In ordered tissues such as nerves, this 
      information can be used to reconstruct the primary direction of diffusion along 
      fiber tracts, which may provide information on fiber tract continuity after nerve 
      injury and surgical repair. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with different 
      degrees of partial transection of the sciatic nerve followed by immediate repair and 
      euthanized after 1 week of recovery. Nerves were then harvested, fixed, and scanned 
      with a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging to obtain DTIand fiber tractography in 
      each sample. Additional behavioral (sciatic function index, foot fault asymmetry) 
      and histological (Toluidine blue staining) assessments were performed for 
      validation. RESULTS: Tractography yielded a visual representation of the degree of 
      injury that correlated with behavioral and histological evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: 
      DTI tractography is a noninvasive tool that can yield a visual representation of a 
      partial nerve transection as early as 1 week after surgical repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic component of multiple sclerosis (MS) is now set to 200 
      autosomal common variants. However, it is unclear how genetic knowledge be 
      clinically used in the differential diagnosis between MS and other inflammatory 
      conditions like adult-onset postinfectious neurological syndromes (PINS). The aim of 
      this study was to investigate whether PINS and MS have a shared genetic background 
      using an updated polygenic risk scores. METHODS: Eighty-eight PINS patients have 
      been consecutively recruited between 1996 and 2016 at Mondino Foundation of Pavia, 
      diagnosed according to clinical, MRI and CSF findings and followed-up for several 
      years. Patients were typed using Illumina array, and genotypes imputed using the 
      1000 Genomes Project reference panel. A weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) has been 
      calculated based on autosomal MS risk loci derived from large-scale studies, and an 
      HLA genetic burden (HLAGB) was also calculated on loci associated to MS. RESULTS: 
      PINS occurred as an episode of myelitis in 44% of patients, encephalomyelitis in 
      44%, and encephalitis in remaining cases, with an involvement of peripheral nervous 
      system in 41% of patients. Mean age of onset was 50.1 years, and female:male ratio 
      was 1.4. Patients were followed-up for a mean of 7.2 years, and at last visit 55% 
      had a low disability grade (mRS 0-1). Disease was monophasic in 67% of patients, 
      relapsing in 18% and chronic-progressive in 15%. The wGRS of PINS cases was 
      comparable to 370 healthy controls, while significantly lower compared to 907 
      bout-onset MS (BOMS) cases (wGRS= 20.9 vs 21.2; p<0.0001). The difference was even 
      larger for PINS with peripheral nervous system involvement (wGRS=20.6) vs BOMS. 
      CONCLUSION: The distinction between MS and PINS is not easy to make in clinical 
      practice. However, our study shows that the new set of MS risk alleles does not 
      confer increased susceptibility to PINS. These data support the importance to 
      discriminate these cases from MS with pathophysiological and therapeutic 
      implications.

AB  - We have made cross-sectional image "neurograms" in which peripheral nerve has a 
      greater signal intensity than that of other tissue. Neurographic images of the 
      rabbit forelimb were obtained using a spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      technique that combines fat suppression and diffusion weighting. After fat 
      suppression the nerve shows up in relative isolation and is brighter than the 
      surrounding tissue due to its longer T2 relaxation time of approximately 50 ms 
      compared to approximately 27 ms for muscle. The addition of pulsed gradients for 
      diffusion weighting of the MR signal further enhances the intensity of the nerve 
      signal relative to that of surrounding muscle tissue. The greater diffusional 
      anisotropy of nerve tissue (D parallel/D perpendicular = 3.1) compared to that of 
      muscle (D parallel/D perpendicular = 1.9) allows further enhancement of the nerve by 
      a subtraction of two diffusion-weighted images, one with the gradients oriented 
      parallel and one with the gradients oriented perpendicular to the nerve orientation. 
      We show that by manipulation of the MRI parameters, either echo time or pulsed 
      gradient strength, the nerves can be made to show up as the most intense feature. 
      This verifies the feasibility of generating three-dimensional "neurographic" images, 
      analogous to angiograms, but which demonstrate the peripheral nerve tracts in 
      apparent isolation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multiple recent studies have reported on diffusion tensor-based fiber 
      tracking of cranial nerves in vestibular schwannoma, with conflicting results as to 
      the accuracy of the method and the occurrence of cochlear nerve depiction. 
      Probabilistic nontensor-based tractography might offer advantages in terms of better 
      extraction of directional information from the underlying data in cranial nerves, 
      which are of subvoxel size. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with large vestibular 
      schwannomas were recruited. The probabilistic tracking was run preoperatively and 
      the position of the potential depictions of the facial and cochlear nerves was 
      estimated postoperatively by 3 independent observers in a blinded fashion. The true 
      position of the nerve was determined intraoperatively by the surgeon. Thereafter, 
      the imaging-based estimated position was compared with the intraoperatively 
      determined position. Tumor size, cystic appearance, and postoperative 
      House-Brackmann score were analyzed with regard to the accuracy of the depiction of 
      the nerves. RESULTS: The probabilistic tracking showed a connection that correlated 
      to the position of the facial nerve in 81% of the cases and to the position of the 
      cochlear nerve in 33% of the cases. Altogether, the resulting depiction did not 
      correspond to the intraoperative position of any of the nerves in 3 cases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In a majority of cases, the position of the facial nerve, but not of 
      the cochlear nerve, could be estimated by evaluation of the probabilistic tracking 
      results. However, false depictions not corresponding to any nerve do occur and 
      cannot be discerned as such from the image only.

      sequences. The images were interpreted by two radiologists blinded to the affected 
      sides of the patients. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the 
      symptomatic and asymptomatic sides in terms of mean trigeminal nerve length (8.8 ± 
      2.34 mm vs. 9.39 ± 2.29 mm; respectively, p=0.001) and thickness (20.9 ± 9.6 mm2 vs. 
      25 ± 9.98 mm2, respectively; p < 0.001). The median cerebellopontine cistern 
      cross-sectional area was considerably lower on the symptomatic side compared with 
      the asymptomatic side [201 mm2 (interquartile range=93) vs. 224.5 mm2 (interquartile 
      range=77), respectively; p < 0.001]. There were no significant differences between 
      the trigeminal-pontine angle width on either side (38.32 ± 10.38 vs. 38.78 ± 10.9, 
      respectively; p=0.679). There were no statistically significant differences between 
      the right and left sides regarding these parameters in the control group. 
      CONCLUSION: Smaller CPC cross-sectional area, trigeminal nerve length, and 
      trigeminal nerve thickness on MRI were demonstrated to commonly exist on the 
      symptomatic side in patients with TN. We suggest that this narrow space may increase 
      the risk of vascular compression on the nerve.

AB  - The need for non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerves that can reliably assess 
      extent of nerve fiber degeneration and regeneration is increasingly realized. 
      Availability of such a technology has several immediate clinical and preclinical 
      applications. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an emerging magnetic resonance based 
      technology that is particularly suited for imaging nerve fiber tracts. This review 
      highlights immediate clinical and preclinical uses of non-invasive imaging of 
      peripheral nerve regeneration and DTI as a potential technology that can fulfill 
      these clinical and research needs.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to propose a semiautomated 
      technique to segment and measure the volume of different nerve components of the 
      tibial nerve, such as the nerve fascicles and the epineurium, based on magnetic 
      resonance microneurography and a segmentation tool derived from brain imaging; and 
      to assess the reliability of this method by measuring interobserver and 
      intraobserver agreement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tibial nerve of 20 healthy 
      volunteers (age range = 23-69; mean = 47; standard deviation = 15) was investigated 
      at the ankle level. High-resolution images were obtained through tailored 
      microneurographic sequences, covering 28 mm of nerve length. Two operators manually 
      segmented the nerve using the in-phase image. This region of interest was used to 
      mask the nerve in the water image, and two-class segmentation was performed to 
      measure the fascicular volume, epineurial volume, nerve volume, and fascicular to 
      nerve volume ratio (FNR). Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were 
      calculated. RESULTS: The nerve structure was clearly visualized with distinction of 
      the fascicles and the epineurium. Segmentation provided absolute volumes for nerve 
      volume, fascicular volume, and epineurial volume. The mean FNR resulted in 0.69 with 
      a standard deviation of 0.04 and appeared to be not correlated with age and sex. 
      Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were excellent with alpha values >0.9 for 
      each parameter investigated, with measurements free of systematic errors at the 
      Bland-Altman analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the method is reproducible and 
      the parameter FNR is a novel feature that may help in the diagnosis of neuropathies 
      detecting changes in volume of the fascicles or the epineurium.

TI  - Peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging is reliable and reproducible.
PG  - 962-9
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25056 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the reliability and reproducibility of peripheral nerve 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      assessed the test-retest and interrater reliability studies of peripheral nerve DTI 
      in a cohort of 12 healthy subjects (mean age 44.0 years, range 26-71 years). 
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed on a 3T scanner (MR750, GE 
      Healthcare). DTI and T1 -weighted sequences were performed on the tibial and 
      peroneal nerves in the knee. Each subject was scanned on three separate occasions. 
      Image analyses were performed at two anatomic positions: the level of the lateral 
      femoral condyle (position 1), and the superior pole of the patella (position 2). 
      Analysis was performed using three software packages ("raters"): FuncTools, FSL, and 
      Diffusion Toolkit. Metrics obtained included fractional anisotropy (FA), axial 
      diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). RESULTS: DTI metrics were not 
      significantly different between each measurement position, except peroneal nerve AD 
      and tibial nerve RD were higher at position 1 (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). 
      There was no significant difference in DTI metrics between male and female subjects 
      (P = 0.10-0.99). The test-retest reliability of DTI metrics was high, maximal for FA 
      (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96). ICC values for individual DTI 
      metrics were similar between each measurement position, except that tibial nerve AD 
      was significantly higher at position 2 (P = 0.03). Interrater reliability was also 
      high (ICC = 0.95-0.96). CONCLUSION: We found peripheral nerve DTI to be reliable and 
      reproducible, with few effects related to the postprocessing package used.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging markers have been widely used to detect and 
      quantify white matter pathologies in multiple sclerosis. We have recently developed 
      a diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) to distinguish and quantify co-existing 
      axonal injury, demyelination, and inflammation in multiple sclerosis patients and 
      animal models. It could serve as a longitudinal marker for axonal loss, a primary 
      cause of permanent neurological impairments and disease progression. METHODS: Eight 
      10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice underwent optic nerve DBSI, followed by a week-long 
      recuperation prior to active immunization for experimental autoimmune 
      encephalomyelitis (EAE). Visual acuity of all mice was assessed daily. Longitudinal 
      DBSI was performed in mouse optic nerves at baseline (naïve, before immunization), 
      before, during, and after the onset of optic neuritis. Tissues were perfusion fixed 
      after final in vivo scans. The correlation between DBSI detected pathologies and 
      corresponding immunohistochemistry markers was quantitatively assessed. RESULTS: In 
      this cohort of EAE mice, monocular vision impairment occurred in all animals. In 
      vivo DBSI detected, differentiated, and quantified optic nerve inflammation, 
      demyelination, and axonal injury/loss, correlating nerve pathologies with visual 
      acuity at different time points of acute optic neuritis. DBSI quantified, in the 
      presence of optic nerve swelling, ~15% axonal loss at the onset of optic neuritis in 
      EAE mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the notion that axonal loss could occur 
      early in EAE mice. DBSI detected pathologies in the posterior visual pathway 
      unreachable by optical coherence tomography and without confounding inflammation 
      induced optic nerve swelling. DBSI could thus decipher the interrelationship among 
      various pathological components and the role each plays in disease progression. 
      Quantification of the rate of axonal loss could potentially serve as the biomarker 
      to predict treatment outcome and to determine when progressive disease starts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ultrasound (US) characteristics of peripheral nerves in 
      chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and their 
      correlations with electrodiagnostic (EDX) characteristics. METHODS: Nineteen 
      patients with CIDP and 19 healthy controls matched by age and body mass index were 
      included in a blind case-control, observational study. All patients underwent a 
      neurologic examination (including inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment 
      [INCAT] and Medical Research Council [MRC] sum score) and an EDX study. Each patient 
      and each control underwent a US study of 14 nerve segments, yielding a total number 
      of 266 segments scanned in each group. RESULTS: US changes, characterized by an 
      increased nerve cross-sectional area (NCSA), were detected in 53% of the 266 patient 
      nerve segments. Mean NCSA was higher in nerve segments of patients than in those of 
      controls (p < 0.001). Nerve segments with abnormal US belonged to patients with 
      longer disease duration, lower MRC sum score, higher INCAT score, and progressive 
      disease form (all p < 0.0001). All the aforementioned variables were independently 
      associated with the occurrence of US changes. Motor nerve conduction was 
      significantly lower in nerve segments with increased NCSA than in those with normal 
      NCSA (p < 0.0001). NCSA in segments with prevalent myelin damage was higher than 
      that in segments with prevalent axonal damage (p = 0.001) or in segments with normal 
      EDX characteristics (p < 0.0001). NCSA and motor nerve conduction velocity were 
      inversely correlated in nerve segments with EDX evidence of myelin damage (R = 
      0.599; p < 0.0001). Conduction blocks were associated with increased NCSA (p = 
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: US may, similar to MRI, have a supporting role in the diagnosis 
      of CIDP. US and EDX changes are correlated.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of forearm nerves in humans.
PG  - 920-7
LID - 10.1002/jmri.23709 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To implement a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol for visualization of 
      peripheral nerves in human forearm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This Health Insurance 
      Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant study was approved by our 
      Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from 10 healthy 
      participants. T(1) - and T(2) -weighted turbo spin echo with fat saturation, short 
      tau inversion recovery (STIR), and DTI sequences with 21 diffusion-encoding 
      directions were implemented to acquire images of the forearm nerves with an 8 
      channel knee coil on a 3T MRI scanner. Identification of the nerves was based on 
      T(1) -weighted, T(2) -weighted, STIR, and DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) 
      images. Maps of the DTI-derived indices, FA, mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal 
      diffusivity (λ(//) ), and radial diffusivity (λ(⟂) ) along the length of the nerves 
      were generated. RESULTS: DTI-derived maps delineated the forearm nerves more clearly 
      than images acquired with other sequences. Only ulnar and median nerves were clearly 
      visualized on the DTI-derived FA maps. No significant differences were observed 
      between the left and right forearms in any of the DTI-derived measures. Significant 
      variation in the DTI measures was observed along the length of the nerve. 
      Significant differences in the DTI measures were also observed between the median 
      and ulnar nerves. CONCLUSION: DTI is superior in visualizing the median and ulnar 
      nerves in the human forearm. The normative data could potentially help distinguish 
      normal from diseased nerves.

TI  - Peripheral nerve perfusion by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging: 
      demonstration of feasibility.
PG  - 518-23
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000046 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to establish dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion 
      in peripheral nerves for determination of blood-nerve permeability (K) and nerve 
      blood volume (NBV) in peripheral neuropathies as compared with healthy controls. 
      METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written 
      informed consent was obtained from all participants. Forty-three controls (24 women, 
      19 men; age, 48.7 ± 17.5 years) and 59 patients with peripheral neuropathy (28 
      women, 31 men; age, 52.7 ± 12.4 years) were examined by a standard protocol 
      including a T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence (time of repetition/time 
      of echo, 4.91/1.64; 10 slices; resolution 0.8 × 0.6 × 3.0 mm3). Time - signal 
      intensity analysis was performed by normalizing to pre-bolus arrival and calculating 
      the mean contrast uptake (MCU) for each patient. Further analyses were performed by 
      customized software to calculate K trans and NBV. Statistical analysis included 
      2-sided Student's t tests of controls versus patients, receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis, and subgroup analysis of patients according to etiologies 
      of neuropathy. RESULTS: Time-signal intensity analysis showed significantly 
      increased contrast uptake in patients as compared with controls (MCU, 1.29 ± 0.15 vs 
      1.18 ± 0.08; P < 0.001). This was caused mainly by an increase in K trans (0.046 ± 
      0.025 vs 0.026 ± 0.016 min(-1); P < 0.001) and less by an increase in NBV (3.9 ± 2.6 
      vs 3.0 ± 1.9 mL/100 mL; P = 0.12). This trend was true for all etiologies except 
      entrapment neuropathies. Excluding these, receiver operating characteristic analysis 
      found an area under the curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.89) for MCU 
      and 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.90) for K to discriminate neuropathy from 
      control. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion is a feasible technique to 
      assess K trans and NBV in peripheral nerves and may be used in future investigations 
      on peripheral neuropathies.

TI  - Pretreatment MR-based radiomics nomogram as potential imaging biomarker for 
      individualized assessment of perineural invasion status in rectal cancer.
PG  - 847-857
LID - 10.1007/s00261-020-02710-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether pretreatment magnetic resonance (MR)-based radiomics 
      nomogram can individualize prediction of perineural invasion (PNI) status in rectal 
      cancer (RC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 122 RC patients with pathologically 
      confirmed were classified as training cohort (n = 87) and test cohort (n = 35). 180 
      radiomics features were extracted from all lesions based on oblique axial T(2)WI TSE 
      images. The dimensionality reduction and feature selection in training cohort were 
      realized by the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm and the least 
      absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. A predictive 
      model combining radiomics features and clinical risk factors (pathological N stage, 
      pathological LVI status) was established by multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis. The performance of the model was assessed based on its receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curve, nomogram, and calibration. RESULTS: The developed 
      radiomics nomogram that integrated the radiomics signature and clinical risk factors 
      could provide discrimination in the training and test cohorts. The accuracy and the 
      area under the curve (AUC) for assessing PNI status were 0.82, 0.86, respectively, 
      in the training cohort, while they were 0.71 and 0.85 in the test cohort. The 
      goodness-of-fit of the nomogram was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test 
      (p = 0.52 in training cohort and p = 0.24 in test cohort). Decision curve analysis 
      (DCA) showed that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: The 
      developed radiomics nomogram might be helpful in the individualized assessment PNI 
      status in patients with RC. This stratification of RC patients according to their 
      PNI status may provide the basis for individualized adjuvant therapy, especially for 
      stage II patients.

TI  - Multicenter reproducibility study of diffusion MRI and fiber tractography of the 
      lumbosacral nerves.
PG  - 951-963
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25964 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been applied in the lumbar and sacral 
      nerves in vivo, but information about the reproducibility of this method is needed 
      before DTI can be used reliably in clinical practice across centers. PURPOSE: In 
      this multicenter study the reproducibility of DTI of the lumbosacral nerves in 
      healthy volunteers was investigated. STUDY TYPE: Prospective control series. 
      SUBJECTS: Twenty healthy subjects. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T MRI. 3D turbo spin 
      echo, and 3.0 mm isotropic DTI scan. ASSESSMENT: The DTI scan was performed three 
      times (twice in the same session, intrascan reproducibility, and once after an hour, 
      interscan reproducibility). At site 2, 1 week later, the protocol was repeated 
      (interweek reproducibility). Fiber tractography (FT) of the lumbar and sacral nerves 
      (L3-S2) was performed to obtain values for fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and 
      radial diffusivity. STATISTICAL TESTS: Reproducibility was determined using the 
      intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and power calculations were performed. 
      RESULTS: FT was successful and reproducible in all datasets. ICCs for all diffusion 
      parameters were high for intrascan (ranging from 0.70-0.85), intermediate for 
      interscan (ranging from 0.61-0.73), and interweek reliability (ranging from 
      0.58-0.62). There were small but significant differences between the interweek 
      diffusivity values (P < 0.0005). Depending on the effect size, nerve location, and 
      parameter of interest, power calculations showed that sample sizes between 10 and 
      232 subjects are needed for cross-sectional studies. DATA CONCLUSION: We found that 
      DTI and FT of the lumbosacral nerves have intermediate to high reproducibility 
      within and between scans. Based on these results, 10-58 subjects are needed to find 
      a 10% change in parameters in cross-sectional studies of the lumbar and sacral 
      nerves. The small significant differences of the interweek comparison suggest that 
      results from longitudinal studies need to be interpreted carefully, since small 
      differences may also be caused by factors other than disease progression or 
      therapeutic effects. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn.

TI  - The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of peripheral nerves 
      following traumatic lesion: where do we stand?
PG  - 281-290
LID - 10.1007/s00701-016-3055-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerve injury is a common and important cause of morbidity and 
      disability in patients who have suffered a traumatic injury, particularly younger 
      people. Various different injuries can result in damage to specific nerves. In 
      patients with multiple trauma, the prevalence of peripheral nerve injury is 
      estimated at 2.8%, but can reach 5% with the inclusion of brachial plexus 
      involvement. Physical examination, as well as the origin and location of the trauma, 
      can indicate the nerve involved and the type of nerve damage. However, the depth and 
      severity of damage, and the structures involved often cannot be determined 
      initially, but depend on longer periods of observation to reach a definitive and 
      accurate diagnosis for which treatment can be proposed. Current approaches to locate 
      and assess the severity of traumatic nerve injury involve clinical and 
      electrodiagnostic studies. From a clinical and neurophysiological point of view, 
      nerve injuries are classified in an attempt to correlate the degree of injury with 
      symptoms, type of pathology, and prognosis, as well as to determine the therapy to 
      be adopted. OBJECTIVES: MRI in the diagnosis of traumatic peripheral nerve injury 
      has increasingly been used by surgeons in clinical practice. In this article, we 
      analyze the use of magnetic resonance (MR) for the evaluation of traumatic 
      peripheral nerve diseases that are surgically treatable. We also consider basic 
      concepts in the evaluation of technical and MR signs of peripheral nerve injuries. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were identified following a computerized search of 
      MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present), and the Cochrane database. The 
      MEDLINE search was conducted on PUBMED, the EMBASE search was conducted on OVID, and 
      the Cochrane database was conducted using their online library. A set was created 
      using the terms: 'traumatic', 'nerve', and 'resonance'. RESULTS: The included 
      articles were identified using a computerized search and the resulting databases 
      were then sorted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This yielded 
      10,340 articles (MEDLINE, n = 758; EMBASE, n = 9564; and Cochrane, n = 18). A search 
      strategy was then built by excluding articles that only concern plexus injury and 
      adding the terms 'neuropathies', 'DTI' and 'neurotmesis'. In total, seven studies 
      were included in the review effectively addressing the role of MRI in the evaluation 
      of traumatic peripheral nerve injury. We extracted all relevant information on the 
      imaging findings and the use of magnetic resonance in trauma. We did not include 
      technical or specific radiological aspects of the imaging techniques. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These seven articles were subsequently evaluated by analyzing their results, 
      methodological approach, and conclusions presented.

AB  - Peripheral nerve injuries result in severe loss of sensory and motor functions in 
      the afflicted limb. There is a lack of standardised models to non-invasively study 
      degeneration, regeneration, and normalisation of neuronal microstructure in 
      peripheral nerves. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive evaluation of 
      peripheral nerve injuries, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis 
      imaging (DKI), and tractography on a rat model of sciatic nerve injury. 10 female 
      Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to sciatic nerve neurotmesis and studied using a 
      9.4 T magnet, by performing DTI and DKI of the sciatic nerve before and 4 weeks 
      after injury. The distal nerve stump showed a decrease in fractional anisotropy 
      (FA), mean kurtosis (MK), axonal water fraction (AWF), and radial and axonal 
      kurtosis (RK, AK) after injury. The proximal stump showed a significant decrease in 
      axial diffusivity (AD) and increase of MK and AK as compared with the uninjured 
      nerve. Both mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) increased in the 
      distal stump after injury. Tractography visualised the sciatic nerve and the site of 
      injury, as well as local variations of the diffusion parameters following injury. In 
      summary, the described method detects changes both proximal and distal to the nerve 
      injury.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the current study is to investigate the diagnostic role of 
      shear-wave elastography and diffusion tensor imaging in patients with carpal tunnel 
      syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included a total of 77 wrists; 18 normal, 
      35 wrists with mild, 9 wrists with moderate and 15 wrists with severe carpal tunnel 
      syndrome. Elastography of the median nerve was performed by defining the boundaries 
      of a segment of the nerve at sagittal plane at the level of proximal carpal row. 
      Additionally, the cross-sectional area of the median nerve was evaluated. Fractional 
      anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient measurements were carried out by 
      placing region-of-interest at three levels: at pisiform bone (carpal tunnel inlet), 
      mid carpal tunnel, and hook of hamate (carpal tunnel outlet). RESULTS: Patients with 
      carpal tunnel syndrome had higher elasticity values of median nerve (53.0 kPa; IQR 
      40.8-77.0 kPa) compared to control subjects. (36.8 kPa; IQR 31.0-39.9 kPa) Patients 
      with moderate-severe carpal tunnel syndrome had higher elasticity values (82 kPa; 
      IQR 64.0-95.5 kPa) compared to patients with mild carpal tunnel syndrome. (44 kPa; 
      IQR 32.5-59.5 kPa) Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome had lower fractional 
      anisotropy at mid-carpal level (0.382; IQR 0.330-0.495) compared to the control 
      group. (0.494; IQR 0.434-0.537) Patients with moderate-severe carpal tunnel syndrome 
      had lower fractional anisotropy values (0.366; IQR 0.331-0.407) and higher apparent 
      diffusion coefficient values (1.509 mm(2)/s; IQR 1.374-1.733 mm(2)/s) compared to 
      patients with mild carpal tunnel syndrome. (0,423; IQR 0.324-0.526 and 
      1.293 mm(2)/s; IQR 0.967-1.514 mm(2)/s) CONCLUSION: Shear-wave elastography and 
      diffusion tensor imaging are helpful imaging modalities in diagnosing carpal tunnel 
      syndrome and assessing its severity.

TI  - High resolution diffusion tensor imaging of human nerves in forearm.
PG  - 1374-83
LID - 10.1002/jmri.24300 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To implement high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for 
      visualization and quantification of peripheral nerves in human forearm. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by our Institutional Review 
      Board and written informed consent was obtained from all the study participants. 
      Images were acquired with T1 -and T2 -weighted turbo spin echo with/without fat 
      saturation, short tau inversion recovery (STIR). In addition, high spatial 
      resolution (1.0 × 1.0 × 3.0 mm(3) ) DTI sequence was optimized for clearly 
      visualizing ulnar, superficial radial and median nerves in the forearm. Maps of the 
      DTI derived indices, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal 
      diffusivity (λ// ) and radial diffusivity (λ⊥ ) were generated. RESULTS: For the 
      first time, the three peripheral nerves, ulnar, superficial radial, and median, were 
      visualized unequivocally on high resolution DTI-derived maps. DTI delineated the 
      forearm nerves more clearly than other sequences. Significant differences in the 
      DTI-derived measures, FA, MD, λ// and λ⊥ , were observed among the three nerves. A 
      strong correlation between the nerve size derived from FA map and T2 -weighted 
      images was observed. CONCLUSION: High spatial resolution DTI is superior in 
      identifying and quantifying the median, ulnar, and superficial radial nerves in 
      human forearm. Consistent visualization of small nerves and nerve branches is 
      possible with high spatial resolution DTI. These normative data could potentially 
      help in identifying pathology in diseased nerves. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

AB  - AIM: To investigate the applicability of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance 
      neurography (DW-MRN) in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In total, 47 patients with CTS (69 wrists) and 19 normal participants (38 
      wrists) was included in this study. Cross-sectional area (CSA) and apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median nerves in the carpal tunnel were 
      determined using DW-MRN. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was 
      performed. RESULTS: No significant differences in age or body mass index (BMI) were 
      observed between the control and CTS groups. DW-MRN imaging showed obvious 
      hyperintensity in the lesions in CTS wrists, while other nerve regions were related 
      to slight hyperintensity. Interobserver variability analysis indicated excellent 
      agreement regarding both the CSA and ADC measurements for the control and CTS 
      groups. Both the mean CSA and ADC values of the median nerves in carpal tunnel in 
      the CTS group were significantly higher than the control group. According to the ROC 
      analysis, the CSA cut-off value was 11.7 mm(2), and sensitivity and specificity 
      were 66.7% and 89.5%, respectively. Conversely, the median nerve ADC cut-off value 
      was 1.047×10(-3) mm(2)/s. The sensitivity and specificity were 91.3% and 76.3.9%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: DW-MRN represents a highly reproducible diagnostic 
      technique for CTS. The ADC value of median nerves in the carpal tunnel is 
      significantly higher in CTS patients, which provides a potential powerful tool for 
      the disease diagnosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Investigation of peripheral neuropathies by magnetic resonance 
      neurography (MRN) may provide increased diagnostic accuracy when performed in 
      combination with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This study seeks to evaluate DTI in 
      the detection of neuropathic abnormalities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A). 
      METHODS: MRI of the sciatic and tibial nerves, including MRN and DTI, was 
      prospectively performed in 15 CMT1A patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs). The 
      following MRI parameters were evaluated and correlated with clinical and 
      neurophysiological findings: T2-relaxation time, proton spin density (PD) and DTI 
      (fractional anisotropy [FA] and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]). RESULTS: DTI 
      showed lower FA and higher ADC in CMT1A compared with HCs. T2 relaxation time showed 
      no difference; however, PD of the sciatic nerve was higher in CMT1A. There were some 
      close associations between neuropathy severity and MRN-DTI, with the closest 
      correlation between FA and nerve conduction velocity in the sciatic nerve (r = 0.76, 
      P < 0.01). DISCUSSION: MRN-DTI evaluation of sciatic and tibial nerves improves the 
      detection of nerve abnormalities in patients with CMT1A. Muscle Nerve 56: E78-E84,

AB  - AIM: To evaluate inter-reader performance for cross-sectional area and fat 
      quantification of bilateral sciatic nerves on MRI and assess correlations with 
      anthropometrics. METHODS: In this IRB-approved, HIPPA-compliant study, three readers 
      performed a cross-sectional analysis of 3T lumbosacral plexus MRIs over an 18-month 
      period. Image slices were evaluated at two levels (A and B). The sciatic nerve was 
      outlined using a free hand region of interest tool on PACS. Proton-density fat 
      fraction (FF) and cross-sectional areas were recorded. Inter-reader agreement was 
      assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Spearman correlation 
      coefficients were used for correlations with age, BMI and height and Wilcoxon rank 
      sum test was used to assess gender differences. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients were 
      included in this study with male to female ratio of 1:1. Inter-reader agreement was 
      good to excellent for FF measurements at both levels (ICC=0.71-0.90) and poor for 
      sciatic nerve areas (ICC=0.08-0.27). Positive correlations of sciatic FF and area 
      were seen with age (p value<0.05). Males had significantly higher sciatic 
      intraneural fat than females (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Fat quantification MRI is highly 
      reproducible with significant positive correlations of sciatic FF and area with age, 
      which may have implications for MRI diagnosis of sciatic neuropathy. KEY POINTS: • 
      MR proton density fat fraction is highly reproducible at multiple levels. • Sciatic 
      intraneural fat is positively correlated with increasing age (p < 0.05). • Positive 
      correlations exist between bilateral sciatic nerve areas and age (p < 0.05). • Males 
      had significantly higher sciatic intraneural fat than females (p < 0.05).

TI  - Assessment of the Effect of Autograft Orientation on Peripheral Nerve Regeneration 
      Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
PG  - 384-390
LID - 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001357 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Given no definite consensus on the accepted autograft orientation during 
      peripheral nerve injury repair, we compare outcomes between reverse and normally 
      oriented autografts using an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique, 
      diffusion tensor imaging. METHODS: Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      divided into 3 groups: sham-left sciatic nerve isolation without injury, reverse 
      autograft-10-mm cut left sciatic nerve segment reoriented 180° and used to coapt the 
      proximal and distal stumps, or normally oriented autograft-10-mm cut nerve segment 
      kept in its normal orientation for coaptation. Animals underwent sciatic functional 
      index and foot fault behavior studies at 72 hours, and then weekly. At 6 weeks, 
      axons proximal, within, and distal to the autograft were evaluated using diffusion 
      tensor imaging and choline acetyltransferase motor staining for 
      immunohistochemistry. Toluidine blue staining of 1-μm sections was used to assess 
      axon count, density, and diameter. Bilateral gastrocnemius/soleus muscle weights 
      were compared to obtain a net wet weight. Comparison of the groups was performed 
      using Mann-Whiney U or Kruskal-Wallis H tests to determine significance. RESULTS: 
      Diffusion tensor imaging findings including fractional anisotropy, radial 
      diffusivity, and axial diffusivity were similar between reverse and normally 
      oriented autografts. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography demonstrated 
      proximodistal nerve regeneration in both autograft groups. Motor axon counts 
      proximal, within, and distal to the autografts were similar. Likewise, axon count, 
      density, and diameter were similar between the autograft groups. Muscle net weight 
      at 6 weeks and behavioral outcomes (sciatic functional index and foot fault) at any 
      tested time point were also similar between reverse and normally oriented 
      autografts. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging may be a useful assessment tool 
      for peripheral nerve regeneration. Reversing nerve autograft polarity did not 
      demonstrate to have an influence on functional or regenerative outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerve injury is often followed by a highly variable recovery 
      process with respect to both rapidity and efficacy. Identifying post-nerve injury 
      phenomena is key to assessing the merit and timing of surgery as well as to tracking 
      nerve recovery postoperatively. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has been investigated 
      in the clinical and research settings as a noninvasive technique to both assess and 
      monitor each patient's unique case of peripheral nerve damage. NEW METHOD: We 
      identify a MRI-suitable marker for tracking the exact site of either nerve injury or 
      coaptation following surgical repair to aid with DTI analysis. RESULTS: Due to 
      artefact and disruption of tractography, silver wire and microvascular clips were 
      not suitable markers. AxoGuard®, 4-0 vicryl suture, and 10-0 polyamide suture, 
      although detectable, did not produce a signal easily distinguished from 
      post-surgical changes. Silicone was easily identifiable and stable in both the acute 
      and delayed time points, exhibited negligible impact on DTI parameters, and 
      possessed geometry to prevent nerve strangulation. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: 
      Prior studies have not assessed the efficacy of other markers nor have they assessed 
      silicone for potential artefact with DTI parameter analysis. Furthermore, this work 
      demonstrates the reliability and compatibility of silicone in the delayed 
      postoperative time period and includes its unique imaging appearance on 
      high-resolution 11.7 MRI. CONCLUSION: Semi-cylindrical silicone tubing can be used 
      as a safe, reliable, and readily available radiological marker to visualize and 
      monitor a region of interest on a rodent's peripheral nerve for aiding assessments 
      with diffusion tensor imaging.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of the sciatic and femoral nerves in unilateral 
      osteoarthritis of the hip and osteonecrosis of femoral head: Comparison of the 
      affected and normal sides.
PG  - 693-699
LID - 10.1080/14397595.2018.1484545 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The aim was to compare the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the sciatic and femoral nerves in patients 
      with unilateral osteoarthritis of the hip (OA) and osteonecrosis of the femoral head 
      (ONFH) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to investigate the mechanism of hip 
      pain. Methods: Forty-four patients (22 OA and 22 ONFH) underwent DTI of the sciatic 
      and femoral nerves at the level of the hip joint and the S1 roots to visualize the 
      tractography and quantify the FA and ADC values. Results: The tractography of the 
      femoral and the sciatic nerves on the affected side with OA and ONFH were similar to 
      those on the normal side. The mean FA values of the sciatic and femoral nerves, and 
      the S1 roots were 0.542, 0.551, and 0.316 with OA, 0.568, 0.560, and 0.318 with ONFH 
      on the affected side, and 0.559, 0.560, and 0.315 on the normal side, respectively, 
      and did not show significant differences. The FA values of the sciatic nerve on the 
      affected side with OA decreased with longer pain duration. Conclusion: The FA and 
      ADC values of the sciatic and femoral nerves in patients with unilateral OA and ONFH 
      showed no significant differences between the affected and normal sides.

TI  - Multimodal evaluation of the cerebrovascular reserve in Neurofibromatosis type 1 
      patients with Moyamoya syndrome.
PG  - 655-663
LID - 10.1007/s10072-020-04574-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) is a rare intracranial arterial vasculopathy which 
      can occur in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) disease, representing a cause of 
      cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) impairment, possibly leading to ischemic stroke. Here, 
      we evaluated noninvasive imaging techniques used to assess CVR in MMS patients, 
      describing clinical and imaging findings in patients affected by MMS-NF1. METHODS: 
      Following strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, in this retrospective 
      observational study, we evaluated imaging data of nine consecutive MMS-NF1 patients 
      (M/F = 5/4, mean age: 12.6 ± 4.0). Subjects underwent a multimodal evaluation of 
      cerebral vascular status, including intracranial arterial MR Angiography (MRA), MRI 
      perfusion with dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) technique, and 
      99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT. RESULTS: In 8 out 9 patients 
      (88.8%, 6/8 symptomatic), time-to-peak maps were correlated with the involved 
      cerebral hemisphere, while in 6 out 9 patients (66.6%, 5/6 symptomatic), mean 
      transit time (MTT) maps showed correspondence with the affected cerebrovascular 
      territories. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) calculated using DSC perfusion failed to 
      detect the hypoperfused regions instead identified by SPECT-CBF in all patients, 
      while MTT maps overlapped with SPECT-CBF data in all cases and time-to-peak maps in 
      60.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Although SPECT imaging still represents the gold standard for 
      CBF assessment, our results suggest that data obtained using DSC perfusion 
      technique, and in particular MTT maps, might be a very useful and noninvasive tool 
      for evaluating hemodynamic status in MMS-NF1 patients.

      Role of Diffusion Tensor Imaging-A Systematic Review.

AB  - In vestibular schwannoma surgery, the preservation of facial and cochlear nerves is 
      of paramount concern regarding to their effect on patients' quality of life. The 
      rate of nerve function preservation has increased with advancements in surgical 
      technique and neuroimaging and the introduction of intraoperative neuromonitoring. 
      The preoperative depiction of anatomical issues between the nerves and tumor could 
      help in surgical planning. Many studies investigating advanced imaging for cranial 
      nerves detection, in particular diffusion tensor imaging, have been reported in the 
      past decade. A systematic review of the reported data evaluating preoperative facial 
      nerve fiber tracking, followed by intraoperative verification, was conducted. 
      Seventeen studies with 223 patients (mean age, 47.5 years; range 17-77; male/female 
      ratio 1:1.4) met our inclusion criteria. Preoperative facial nerve fiber tracking 
      was obtained for 214 patients (96%), and subsequent intraoperative verification 
      revealed a correct prediction for 187 cases (85.5%). The results from the present 
      review have confirmed that preoperative fiber tracking for facial nerve 
      identification during large vestibular schwannoma surgery is valuable and reliable. 
      However, the included studies were not comparable in terms of images, acquisitions, 
      or postprocessing elaboration. Larger series and homogenous magnetic resonance 
      imaging parameters are required to strengthen these findings.

TI  - Magnetic resonance neurography and diffusion tensor imaging: origins, history, and

      in a prospective 5000-patient study group.
PG  - A29-43

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Methods were invented that made it possible to image peripheral nerves in 
      the body and to image neural tracts in the brain. The history, physical basis, and 
      dyadic tensor concept underlying the methods are reviewed. Over a 15-year period, 
      these techniques-magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and diffusion tensor 
      imaging-were deployed in the clinical and research community in more than 2500 
      published research reports and applied to approximately 50,000 patients. Within this 
      group, approximately 5000 patients having MRN were carefully tracked on a 
      prospective basis. METHODS: A uniform Neurography imaging methodology was applied in 
      the study group, and all images were reviewed and registered by referral source, 
      clinical indication, efficacy of imaging, and quality. Various classes of image 
      findings were identified and subjected to a variety of small targeted prospective 
      outcome studies. Those findings demonstrated to be clinically significant were then 
      tracked in the larger clinical volume data set. RESULTS: MRN demonstrates mechanical 
      distortion of nerves, hyperintensity consistent with nerve irritation, nerve 
      swelling, discontinuity, relations of nerves to masses, and image features revealing 
      distortion of nerves at entrapment points. These findings are often clinically 
      relevant and warrant full consideration in the diagnostic process. They result in 
      specific pathological diagnoses that are comparable to electrodiagnostic testing in 
      clinical efficacy. A review of clinical outcome studies with diffusion tensor 
      imaging also shows convincing utility. CONCLUSION: MRN and diffusion tensor imaging 
      neural tract imaging have been validated as indispensable clinical diagnostic 
      methods that provide reliable anatomic pathological information. There is no 
      alternative diagnostic method in many situations. With the elapsing of 15 years, 
      tens of thousands of imaging studies, and thousands of publications, these methods 
      should no longer be considered experimental.

AB  - Development of outcome measures to assess ongoing nerve regeneration in the living 
      animal that can be translated to human can provide extremely useful tools for 
      monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions to promote nerve regeneration. 
      Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance based technique, provides image 
      contrast for nerve tracts and can be applied serially on the same subject with 
      potential to monitor nerve fiber content. In this study, we examined the use of ex 
      vivo high-resolution DTI for imaging intact and regenerating peripheral nerves in 
      mice and correlated the MRI findings with electrophysiology and histology. DTI was 
      done on sciatic nerves with crush, without crush, and after complete transection in 
      different mouse strains. DTI measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA), 
      parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity were acquired and compared in 
      segments of uninjured and crushed/transected nerves and correlated with morphometry. 
      A comparison of axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush showed a comparable 
      pattern of regeneration in different mice strains. FA values were significantly 
      lower in completely denervated nerve segments compared to uninjured sciatic nerve 
      and this signal was restored toward normal in regenerating nerve segments (crushed 
      nerves). Histology data indicate that the FA values and the parallel diffusivity 
      showed a positive correlation with the total number of regenerating axons. These 
      studies suggest that DTI is a sensitive measure of axon regeneration in mouse models 
      and provide basis for further development of imaging technology for application to 
      living animals and humans.

TI  - Imaging of peripheral nerve lesions.
PG  - 621-6
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Clinical investigations of peripheral nerve lesions routinely 
      involve nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Imaging studies are often 
      used to exclude focal mass lesions or external compression and to visualize muscle 
      atrophy. More recently, it has been recognized that magnetic resonance imaging can 
      identify changes in peripheral nerves and secondary neurogenic alterations in 
      skeletal muscle, which may significantly enhance its use in the differential 
      diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute axonal nerve lesions 
      cause a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images at and distal to the lesion site, 
      which correlates with Wallerian degeneration and nerve oedema. Superparamagnetic 
      iron oxide particles provide an exciting new tool to detect the invasion of 
      macrophages into the degenerating nerve distal to an axonal lesion. Prolongation of 
      the T2 relaxation time and gadolinium enhancement of denervated muscle develop in 
      parallel to the development of spontaneous activity on electromyography, and are 
      probably the consequence of capillary enlargement and increased muscular blood 
      volume. SUMMARY: Magnetic resonance imaging supplements the differential diagnosis 
      of peripheral nerve disease. An advantage over clinical neurophysiological 
      investigations is that it is operator independent and painless. It can identify 
      axonal damage and may thus help to identify a lesion site precisely, where 
      fractionated nerve conduction studies are not applicable. Novel contrast media may 
      potentially be used to detect pathophysiologically relevant mechanisms such as 
      infiltration of the nerve by macrophages. Magnetic resonance imaging also has the 
      advantage of providing a lasting detailed topographical picture of regional 
      variations and avoids localization errors of muscles in electromyography.

TI  - Peripheral Nerve Diffusion Tensor Imaging: Assessment of Axon and Myelin Sheath 
      Integrity.
PG  - e0130833

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters 
      as in-vivo biomarkers of axon and myelin sheath integrity of the median nerve in the 
      carpal tunnel as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. METHODS: MRI 
      examinations at 3T including DTI were conducted on wrists in 30 healthy subjects. 
      After manual segmentation of the median nerve quantitative analysis of fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) as well as axial, radial and mean diffusivity (AD, RD, and MD) was 
      carried out. Pairwise Pearson correlations with electrophysiological parameters 
      comprising sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and compound muscle action 
      potential (CMAP) as markers of axon integrity, and distal motor latency (dml) and 
      sensory nerve conduction velocity (sNCV) as markers of myelin sheath integrity were 
      computed. The significance criterion was set at P=0.05, Bonferroni corrected for 
      multiple comparisons. RESULTS: DTI parameters showed a distinct proximal-to-distal 
      profile with FA, MD, and RD extrema coinciding in the center of the carpal tunnel. 
      AD correlated with CMAP (r=0.50, p=0.04, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of myelin 
      sheath integrity. RD correlated with sNCV (r=-0.53, p=0.02, Bonf. corr.) but not 
      with markers of axon integrity. FA correlated with dml (r=-0.63, p=0.002, Bonf. 
      corr.) and sNCV (r=0.68, p=0.001, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of axon 
      integrity. CONCLUSION: AD reflects axon integrity, while RD (and FA) reflect myelin 
      sheath integrity as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. DTI parameters 
      consistently indicate a slight decrease of structural integrity in the carpal tunnel 
      as a physiological site of median nerve entrapment. DTI is particularly sensitive, 
      since these findings are observed in healthy participants. Our results encourage 
      future studies to evaluate the potential of DTI in differentiating axon from myelin 
      sheath injury in patients with manifest peripheral neuropathies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain (NP) is frequent in neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
      disorders (NMOSD). The ventral posterior nucleus (VPN) of the thalamus receives 
      sensory afferences from the spinothalamic tracts and is associated with central pain 
      in other conditions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between NP and VPN 
      volume in aquaporin-4-IgG- positive (AQP4-IgG+) NMOSD. METHODS: This cross-sectional 
      study included 32 AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD patients and 37 healthy controls. NP intensity was 
      determined by the PainDetect Questionnaire. Spinal cord lesion number and location 
      as well as VPN volume were assessed by MRI, the latter using a multi-atlas-based 
      automated segmentation. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (78%) suffered from NP and 
      seven had no pain. Mean VPN volume did not differ between patients with and without 
      NP (p=0.533) or between patients and controls. However, mean VPN volume correlated 
      with average (rho=-0.486, p=0.019) and worst pain intensity (rho=-0.593, p=0.003). 
      Of note, no other thalamic nuclei volumes correlated with measures of pain 
      intensity. Compared to pain-free patients, patients with NP had more lesions 
      involving the thoracic spinal cord (p=0.007). The relationships between VPN and pain 
      intensity measures remained after adjustment for age, myelitis count, and spinal 
      cord lesion location. CONCLUSION: Our data support a model where thoracic spinal 
      cord lesions are associated with the development of NP in AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD and the 
      VPN plays a role in the modulation of NP intensity. VPN volume as assessed in our 
      study may be a clinically meaningful imaging marker of pain severity in AQP4-IgG+ 
      NMOSD.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess with MRI morphometric ultrastructural changes in 
      nerves affected by diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). We used an MR 
      micro-neurography imaging protocol and a semiautomated technique of tissue 
      segmentation to visualize and measure the volume of internal nerve components, such 
      as the epineurium and nerve fascicles. The tibial nerves of 16 patients affected by 
      DPN and of 15 healthy volunteers were imaged. Nerves volume (NV), fascicles volume 
      (FV), fascicles to nerve ratio (FNR), and nerves cross-sectional areas (CSA) were 
      obtained. In patients with DPN the NV was increased and the FNR was decreased, as a 
      result of an increase of the epineurium (FNR in diabetic neuropathy 0,665; in 
      controls 0,699, p = 0,040). CSA was increased in subjects with DPN (12,84 mm(2) 
      versus 10,22 mm(2), p = 0,003). The FV was increased in patients with moderate to 
      severe DPN. We have demonstrated structural changes occurring in nerves affected by 
      DPN, which otherwise are assessable only with an invasive biopsy. MR 
      micro-neurography appears to be suitable for the study of microscopic changes in 
      tibial nerves of diabetic patients.

TI  - Spinal cord diffusion tensor imaging in patients with sensory neuronopathy.
PG  - 1103-1108
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of 
      the cervical spinal cord could aid the (differential) diagnosis of sensory 
      neuronopathies, an underdiagnosed group of diseases of the peripheral nervous 
      system. METHODS: We obtained spinal cord DTI and T2WI at 3 T from 28 patients, 14 
      diabetic subjects with sensory-motor distal polyneuropathy, and 20 healthy controls. 
      We quantified DTI-based parameters and looked at the hyperintense T2W signal at the 
      spinal cord posterior columns. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values at 
      C2-C3 and C3-C4 levels were compared between groups. We also compared average 
      fractional anisotropy (mean of values at C2-C3 and C3-C4 levels). A receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine diagnostic accuracy of 
      average fractional anisotropy, and we compared its sensitivity against the 
      hyperintense signal in segregating patients from the other subjects. RESULTS: Mean 
      age and disease duration were 52 ± 10 and 11.4 ± 9.3 years in the patient group. 
      Eighteen subjects had idiopathic disease and 6 dysimmune etiology. Fractional 
      anisotropy at C3-C4 level and average fractional anisotropy were significantly 
      different between patients and healthy controls (p < 0.001 and <0.001) and between 
      patients and diabetic subjects (p = 0.019 and 0.027). Average fractional anisotropy 
      presented an area under the curve of 0.838. Moreover, it had higher sensitivity than 
      visual detection of the hyperintense signal (0.86 vs. 0.54), particularly for 
      patients with short disease duration. CONCLUSION: DTI-based analysis enables in vivo 
      detection of posterior column damage in sensory neuronopathy patients and is a 
      useful diagnostic test for this condition. It also helps the differential diagnosis 
      between sensory neuronopathy and distal polyneuropathies.

AB  - We assessed the accuracy of semi-automated tumor volume maps of plexiform 
      neurofibroma (PN) generated by a deep neural network, compared to manual 
      segmentation using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data. NF1 Patients were 
      recruited from a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of PN. Multiple b-value 
      DWI was imaged over the largest PN. All DWI datasets were registered and intensity 
      normalized prior to segmentation with a multi-spectral neural network classifier 
      (MSNN). Manual volumes of PN were performed on 3D-T2 images registered to diffusion 
      images and compared to MSNN volumes with the Sørensen-Dice coefficient. Intravoxel 
      incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters were calculated from resulting volumes. 35 MRI 
      scans were included from 14 subjects. Sørensen-Dice coefficient between the 
      semi-automated and manual segmentation was 0.77 ± 0.016. Perfusion fraction (f) was 
      significantly higher for tumor versus normal tissue (0.47 ± 0.42 vs. 0.30 ± 0.22, 
      p = 0.02), similarly, true diffusion (D) was significantly higher for PN tumor 
      versus normal (0.0018 ± 0.0003 vs. 0.0012 ± 0.0002, p < 0.0001). By contrast, the 
      pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*) was significantly lower for PN tumor versus normal 
      (0.024 ± 0.01 vs. 0.031 ± 0.005, p < 0.0001). Volumes generated by a neural network 
      from multiple diffusion data on PNs demonstrated good correlation with manual 
      volumes. IVIM analysis of multiple b-value diffusion data demonstrates significant 
      differences between PN and normal tissue.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging as adjuncts to conventional 
      MRI for the diagnosis and management of peripheral nerve sheath tumors: current 
      perspectives and future directions.
PG  - 4123-4132
LID - 10.1007/s00330-018-5838-8 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) account for ~ 5% of soft tissue neoplasms and 
      are responsible for a wide spectrum of morbidities ranging from localized neuropathy 
      to fulminant metastatic spread and death. MR imaging represents the gold standard 
      for identification of these neoplasms, however, current anatomic MR imaging markers 
      do not reliably detect or differentiate benign and malignant lesions, and therefore, 
      biopsy or excision is required for definitive diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted MR 
      imaging (DWI) serves as a useful tool in the evaluation and management of PNSTs by 
      providing functional information regarding the degree of diffusion, while diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) aids in determining the directional information of predominant 
      diffusion and has been shown to be particularly useful for pre-operative planning of 
      these tumors by delineating healthy and pathologic fascicles. The article focuses on 
      these important neurogenic lesions, highlighting the current utility of diffusion MR 
      imaging and future directions including computerized radiomic analysis. KEY POINTS: 
      • Anatomic MRI is moderately accurate in differentiating benign from malignant PNST. 
      • Diffusion tensor imaging facilitates pre-operative planning of PNSTs by depicting 
      neuropathy and tractography. • Radiomics will likely augment current observer-based 
      diagnostic criteria for PNSTs.

TI  - Neuroimaging of demyelination and remyelination models.
PG  - 241-66
AB  - Small-animal magnetic resonance imaging is becoming an increasingly utilized 
      noninvasive tool in the study of animal models of MS including the most commonly 
      used autoimmune, viral, and toxic models. Because most MS models are induced in 
      rodents with brains and spinal cords of a smaller magnitude than humans, 
      small-animal MRI must accomplish much higher resolution acquisition in order to 
      generate useful data. In this review, we discuss key aspects and important 
      differences between high field strength experimental and human MRI. We describe the 
      role of conventional imaging sequences including T1, T2, and proton density-weighted 
      imaging, and we discuss the studies aimed at analyzing blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
      permeability and acute inflammation utilizing gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Advanced MRI 
      methods, including diffusion-weighted and magnetization transfer imaging in 
      monitoring demyelination, axonal damage, and remyelination, and studies utilizing in 
      vivo T1 and T2 relaxometry, provide insight into the pathology of demyelinating 
      diseases at previously unprecedented details. The technical challenges of small 
      voxel in vivo MR spectroscopy and the biologically relevant information obtained by 
      analysis of MR spectra in demyelinating models is also discussed. Novel 
      cell-specific and molecular imaging techniques are becoming more readily available 
      in the study of experimental MS models. As a growing number of tissue restorative 
      and remyelinating strategies emerge in the coming years, noninvasive monitoring of 
      remyelination will be an important challenge in small-animal imaging. High field 
      strength small-animal experimental MRI will continue to evolve and interact with the 
      development of new human MR imaging and experimental NMR techniques.

TI  - Magnetic Resonance Neurography : Normal Values and Demographic Determinants of Nerve 
      Caliber and T2 Relaxometry in 60 healthy individuals.
PG  - 19-26
LID - 10.1007/s00062-017-0633-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish normal values and to identify demographic determinants of 
      quantitative biomarkers in magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). METHODS: In this 
      study 60 healthy individuals (5 men and 5 women of every decade between 20 and 
      80 years) were examined according to a standardized MRN protocol at 3 T, including 
      multiecho T2 relaxometry. Nerve cross-sectional area (CSA), transverse relaxation 
      time (T2), and proton spin density (PSD) were assessed for the sciatic, tibial, 
      median, ulnar, and radial nerves. Correlation with demographic variables, such as 
      height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and age was expressed by Pearson coefficients 
      and t‑tests were used to compare MRN biomarkers between men and women with and 
      without normalization to body weight and BMI by linear regression. RESULTS: The 
      average nerve CSA correlated moderately with height (r = 0.28, p = 0.04), weight 
      (r = 0.40, p = 0.002), and BMI (r = 0.35, p = 0.008), but not with age (r = 0.23, 
      p = 0.09). While T2 did not correlate with demographic parameters, PSD was strongly 
      inversely associated with BMI (r = -0.64, p < 0.001) and weight (r = -0.557, p < 
      0.001). Sex-dependent differences in imaging marker values were found for CSA but 
      became negligible after normalization to body weight. CONCLUSION: Quantitative 
      biomarkers of MRN co-vary with demographic variables. As particularly important 
      determinants, we identified body weight for nerve CSA and BMI for PSD. The presented 
      normal values and demographic determinants may assist investigations into the 
      potential of MRN biomarkers in further disease-specific studies.

TI  - Diffusion-prepared neurography of the brachial plexus with a large field-of-view at 
      3T.
PG  - 644-54
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25025 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To study diffusion-prepared neurography optimized for a large field-of-view 
      (FOV) to include the neck and both shoulders. In a large FOV poor homogeneity of the 
      magnetic field (B0 ) often leads to poor image quality and possibly to poor 
      diagnostic accuracy. The aim was therefore to find an optimal (combination of) 
      shimming method(s) for diffusion-prepared neurography in a large FOV. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A 3D diffusion-prepared sequence with a large FOV was tested with and 
      without the use of a susceptibility-matched pillow combined with image-based (IB) or 
      standard shimming in six healthy volunteers on a 3T system. B0 , B1 , signal to 
      noise ratio (SNR), and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) were compared between all 
      protocols. Additionally, nerve visibility, fat suppression, artifacts, and overall 
      image quality were ordinally (5-point scale) assessed by two readers. Furthermore, 
      correlations between B0 and B1 (offset and variation) and SNR, CNR, and image 
      quality were explored. RESULTS: The use of the susceptibility-matched pillow led to 
      a 43% reduction of B0 variation over the brachial plexus compared to the situation 
      without a pillow (P < 0.05). The combination of the pillow with IB-shimming and the 
      optimized diffusion-prepared sequence resulted in good nerve visibility, good fat 
      suppression, no artifacts that would hinder clinical diagnosis, and a good overall 
      quality (median scores ≥4). Reducing B0 variation was associated with SNR, CNR, and 
      the above-mentioned scored features (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of a 
      susceptibility-matched pillow in combination with IB-shimming enables robust and 
      high-quality neurography of the complete brachial plexus.

TI  - In-vivo diffusion MRI protocol optimization for the chimpanzee brain and examination 
      of aging effects on the primate optic nerve at 3T.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) data acquisition protocols are well-established on 
      modern high-field clinical scanners for human studies. However, these protocols are 
      not suitable for the chimpanzee (or other large-brained mammals) because of its 
      substantial difference in head geometry and brain volume compared with humans. 
      Therefore, an optimal dMRI data acquisition protocol dedicated to chimpanzee 
      neuroimaging is needed. METHODS: A multi-shot (4 segments) double spin-echo 
      echo-planar imaging (MS-EPI) sequence and a single-shot double spin-echo EPI 
      (SS-EPI) sequence were optimized separately for in vivo dMRI data acquisition of 
      chimpanzees using a clinical 3T scanner. Correction for severe 
      susceptibility-induced image distortion and signal drop-off of the chimpanzee brain 
      was performed and evaluated using FSL software. DTI indices in different brain 
      regions and probabilistic tractography were compared. A separate DTI data set from 
      n=34 chimpanzees (13 to 56 years old) was collected using the optimal protocol. 
      Age-related changes in diffusivity indices of optic nerve fibers were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: The SS-EPI sequence acquired dMRI data of the chimpanzee brain with 
      approximately doubled the SNR as the MS-EPI sequence given the same scan time. The 
      quality of white matter fiber tracking from the SS-EPI data was much higher than 
      that from MS-EPI data. However, quantitative analysis of DTI indices showed no 
      difference in most ROIs between the SS-EPI and MS-EPI sequences. The progressive 
      evolution of diffusivity indices of optic nerves indicated mild changes in fiber 
      bundles of chimpanzees aged 40 years and above. CONCLUSION: The single-shot 
      EPI-based acquisition protocol provided better image quality of dMRI for chimpanzee 
      brains and is recommended for in vivo dMRI study or clinical diagnosis of 
      chimpanzees (or other large animals) using a clinical scanner. Also, the tendency of 
      FA decrease or diffusivity increase in the optic nerve of aged chimpanzees was seen 
      but did not show significant age-related changes, suggesting aging may have less 
      impact on optic nerve fiber integrity of chimpanzees, in contrast to previous 
      results for both macaque monkeys and humans.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for 
      detecting neuropathic changes in proximal nerve segments in patients with peripheral 
      neuropathy. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals with (n = 11) and without (n = 10) 
      peripheral neuropathy underwent DTI of a defined sciatic nerve segment. Patients and 
      controls were evaluated by clinical examination and nerve conduction studies at 
      baseline and 6 months after the initial DTI scan. RESULTS: The mean fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) value was significantly lower in sciatic nerves from patients with 
      peripheral neuropathy as compared with controls. Sciatic nerve FA values correlated 
      with clinical disability scores and electrophysiological parameters of axonal damage 
      at baseline and 6 months after MRI scan. CONCLUSIONS: DTI-derived FA values are a 
      sensitive measure to discriminate healthy from functionally impaired human sciatic 
      nerve segments. DTI of proximal nerve segments may be useful for estimating the 
      proximal axonal degeneration burden in patients with peripheral neuropathies.

TI  - Ultrasmall Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Imaging Identifies Tissue and Nerve 
      Inflammation in Pain Conditions.
PG  - 686-692
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnx267 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Correlation between radiologic structural abnormalities and clinical 
      symptoms in low back pain patients is poor. There is an unmet clinical need to image 
      inflammation in pain conditions to aid diagnosis and guide treatment. Ferumoxytol, 
      an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticle, is clinically used 
      to treat iron deficiency anemia and showed promise in imaging tissue inflammation in 
      human. We explored whether ferumoxytol can be used to identify tissue and nerve 
      inflammation in pain conditions in animals and humans. METHODS: Complete Freud's 
      adjuvant (CFA) or saline was injected into mice hind paws to establish an 
      inflammatory pain model. Ferumoxytol (20 mg/kg) was injected intravenously. Magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to injection and 72 hours postinjection. 
      The changes in the transverse relaxation time (T2) before and after ferumoxytol 
      injection were compared between mice that received CFA vs saline injection. In the 
      human study, we administered ferumoxytol (4 mg/kg) to a human subject with clinical 
      symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy and compared the patient with a healthy subject. 
      RESULTS: Mice that received CFA exhibited tissue inflammation and pain behaviors. 
      The changes in T2 before and after ferumoxytol injection were significantly higher 
      in mice that received CFA vs saline (20.8 ± 3.6 vs 2.2 ± 2.5, P = 0.005). In the 
      human study, ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI identified the nerve root corresponding to the 
      patient's symptoms, but the nerve root was not impinged by structural abnormalities, 
      suggesting the potential superiority of this approach over conventional structural 
      imaging techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI can identify tissue and 
      nerve inflammation and may provide a promising diagnostic tool in assessing pain 
      conditions in humans.

AB  - PURPOSE: MR neurography is known to be useful to evaluate nerve pathology. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of simultaneous apparent T2 
      mapping and neurography with nerve-sheath signal increased with inked rest-tissue 
      rapid acquisition of relaxation enhancement imaging (SHINKEI) to distinguish 
      patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) from healthy 
      subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 13 patients with 
      CIDP and five healthy subjects from 2015 to 2017. The T2 relaxation time and the 
      size of the cervical ganglia and roots of the brachial plexus were measured. 
      Statistical analyses were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and receiver 
      operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The T2 relaxation times of the 
      ganglia and roots were longer in patients with CIDP (119.31 ± 35.53 msec and 
      111.15 ± 33.82 msec) than in healthy subjects (101.42 ± 26.42 msec and 
      85.29 ± 13.22 msec, P = 0.0007 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The sizes of the 
      ganglia and the roots were larger in patients with CIDP (6.25 ± 1.56 mm and 
      4.37 ± 1.71 mm) than in healthy subjects (5.59 ± 1.08 mm and 3.50 ± 0.62 mm, 
      P = 0.0114 and P = 0.0014, respectively). ROC analysis revealed that T2 relaxation 
      time of the roots was best at distinguishing CIDP patients from healthy subjects 
      (the area under the curve = 0.748). CONCLUSION: Patients with CIDP could be 
      distinguished from healthy subjects using simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and 
      neurography with SHINKEI.

TI  - Evaluation of osseous cervical foraminal stenosis in spinal radiculopathy using 
      susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 1855-1862
LID - 10.1007/s00330-018-5769-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of 
      susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SW-MRI) for the evaluation of 
      osseous foraminal stenosis (FS) of the cervical spine compared to conventional 
      MRI-sequences, using computed tomography (CT) as a reference standard. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Twenty-one patients with suspected radiculopathy of the cervical spine were 
      prospectively included. CT and MRI data sets were available for all patients. As 
      standard of reference, 280 neuroforamina of the cervical spine, including 58 
      foraminal stenosis, were identified on sagittal CT images. T1-, T2-, and SW-MRI of 
      the cervical spine were performed. The presence of foraminal stenosis was assessed 
      on sagittal views in all sequences. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and 
      differences in detection rate and severity scoring of foraminal stenosis between the 
      different sequences were tested. CT was used as reference standard for all analysis. 
      RESULTS: Fifty-six of 58 osseous foraminal stenosis could be correctly identified on 
      SW-MR magnitude images. SW-MRI achieved a sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 
      99.5% for the identification of foraminal stenosis. In comparison, conventional 
      T1-weighted MRI sequences achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 43.1% and 100% 
      respectively. T2-weighted MRI sequences achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 
      65.5% and 99.1%, respectively. The overall detection rate was significantly 
      (p < 0.05) higher on SW-MRI and there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in 
      severity scoring compared to CT. T1- and T2-weighted MRI underestimated the degree 
      of foraminal stenosis. Intermodality and interobserver agreements were highest for 
      SW-MRI. CONCLUSIONS: SW-MRI enables the reliable detection of osseous foraminal 
      stenosis of the cervical spine in patients with spinal radiculopathy with a higher 
      sensitivity compared to conventional T1- and T2-MRI sequences, with CT as a 
      reference standard. KEY POINTS: • Susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging 
      enables the reliable detection of osseous foraminal stenosis of the cervical spine 
      with CT as a reference standard. • This could be relevant for younger patients in 
      order to prevent unnecessary radiation exposure. • This may also facilitate a 
      one-stop-shop approach and speed up diagnostic work-up.

TI  - Can imaging techniques measure neuroprotection and remyelination in multiple 
      sclerosis?
PG  - S72-82; discussion S91-6
AB  - MRI is the most important paraclinical measure for assessing and monitoring the 
      pathologic changes implicated in the onset and progression of multiple sclerosis 
      (MS). Conventional MRI sequences, such as T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced and 
      spin-echo T2-weighted imaging, are unable to provide full details about the degree 
      of inflammation and underlying neurodegenerative changes. Newer nonconventional MRI 
      techniques have the potential to detect clinical impairment, disease progression, 
      accumulation of disability, and the neuroprotective effects of treatment. Unenhanced 
      T1-weighted imaging can reveal hypointense black holes, a measure of chronic 
      neurodegeneration. Two- and three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery 
      sequences allow better identification of cortical lesions. Ultrahigh-field strength 
      MRI has the potential to detect subpial cortical and deep gray matter lesions. 
      Magnetization transfer imaging is increasingly used to characterize the evolution of 
      MS lesions and normal-appearing brain tissue. Evidence suggests that the dynamics of 
      magnetization transfer changes correlate with the extent of demyelination and 
      remyelination. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which provides details on tissue 
      biochemistry, metabolism, and function, also has the capacity to reveal 
      neuroprotective mechanisms. By measuring the motion of water, diffusion imaging can 
      provide information about the orientation, size, and geometry of tissue damage in 
      white and gray matter. Functional MRI may help clarify the brain's 
      plasticity-dependent compensatory mechanisms in patients with MS. High-resolution 
      microautoradiography and new contrast agents are proving to be sensitive means for 
      characterizing molecular markers of disease activity, such as activated microglia 
      and macrophages. Optical coherence tomography, a new research technique, makes it 
      possible to investigate relevant physiologic systems that provide accurate measures 
      of tissue changes secondary to the MS disease process. Although detecting the status 
      of neuronal integrity using MRI techniques continues to improve, a "gold standard" 
      model remains to be established.

      techniques, promising directions, and open issues.

AB  - High-resolution ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the two 
      imaging methods of choice for the study of peripheral nerves. The many advances that 
      have been made in recent years, either by US or MR imaging, including diffusion 
      tensor imaging and tractography, offer new perspectives for the assessment of many 
      pathological processes affecting peripheral nerves such as entrapment syndromes, 
      tumors and tumor-like lesions, and traumatic disorders. Most of these improvements 
      have especially increased the spatial resolution of nerve imaging. US and MR imaging 
      are complementary, each having advantages and disadvantages. Tractography is still 
      emerging in the musculoskeletal field, particularly for the analysis of peripheral 
      nerves, but this technique seems promising.

AB  - The median nerve is one of the most commonly affected peripheral nerves in various 
      pathologies such as entrapment syndromes or transections. The diagnostic procedures 
      applied in these situations are electromyography, physical examination methods, 
      ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has 
      been used mostly in imaging the central nervous system (CNS) to visualize white 
      matter tracts. Several studies have shown the clinical applications of DTI in 
      neuronal disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and CNS tumors. Recently, peripheral 
      nerves have been visualized with DTI. Also, in several pathologies such as carpal 
      tunnel syndrome and transection of the median nerve, on postoperative follow-up 
      anisotropy indexes were shown to be affected. However, new studies with larger 
      series are needed.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Ankle as a Possible Predictor of Chemotherapy 
      Induced Peripheral Neuropathy: Pilot Study.
PG  - 121-126
LID - S0363-0188(17)30214-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1067/j.cpradiol.2017.12.012 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is seen in up to 75% of 
      treated cancer patients and can drastically limit their medical management and 
      affect quality of life. Clinical and electrodiagnostic testing for CIPN have many 
      pitfalls. Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used in the 
      evaluation of peripheral nerves. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows promise in the 
      workup of peripheral nerves. In this prospective pilot study, we investigated a 
      possible relationship between DTI and peripheral neuropathy of the ankle and foot in 
      cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: Nine cancer patients with and 
      without CIPN were clinically evaluated using vibratory perception threshold (VPT) 
      testing. VPT score of >25Volts defined presence of CIPN. The posterior tibial nerve 
      and branches in both feet were imaged using MRN and DTI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) 
      and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured at the posterior 
      tibial, medial plantar, and lateral plantar nerves. Measurements for the CIPN group 
      were compared to without CIPN by VPT cutoff. Correlations and possible relationships 
      between DTI parameters and CIPN were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 16feet of 9 
      enrolled patients were imaged (9feet with CIPN and 7feet without CIPN). Average age 
      was 60.6 ± 13.4 years (range: 33-74). Posterior tibial nerve ADC values were 
      significantly lower than the medial plantar nerve ADC values in all feet (F = 3.50, 
      P = 0.04). We found a correlation with FA and ADC values at specific nerve locations 
      with CIPN, with the left medial plantar nerve FA value and left lateral plantar 
      nerve ADC value demonstrating the strongest positive correlations (0.73 and 0.62, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The use of DTI for assessing CIPN is challenging but 
      promising. This pilot study provides preliminary data showing correlations between 
      FA and ADC measurements with CIPN and potential utility of DTI as a predictive 
      marker of onset and severity of CIPN in the ankle and foot, which could aid in 
      preventive strategies. Larger, prospective DTI studies are needed to draw definitive 
      conclusions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: MRN with DTI shows promising results as a potential 
      predictive marker of CIPN in the ankle and foot.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop an in-vivo imaging method for the measurement of 
      dorsal-root-ganglia-(DRG) perfusion, to establish its normal values in patients 
      without known peripheral nerve disorders or radicular pain syndromes and to 
      determine the physiological spatial perfusion pattern within the DRG. METHODS: This 
      prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and written 
      informed consent was obtained from all participants. 46 (24 female, 22 male, mean 
      age 46.0±15.2years) subjects without known peripheral neuropathies or pain syndromes 
      were examined by a 3Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom VERIO or TRIO, Siemens AG, Erlangen, 
      Germany) with a VIBE (Volume-Interpolated-Breathhold-Examination) 
      dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) T1-w-sequence (TR/TE 3.3/1.11ms; 24 slices; voxel 
      resolution 1.3×1.3×3.0mm(3)) covered the pelvis from the upper plate of the 5th 
      lumbar vertebra to the 2nd sacral vertebra. Transfer-constant (K(trans)) and 
      interstitial-volume-fraction (interstitial-leakage-fraction, Ve) were modeled for 
      the DRG and spinal nerve by applying the Tofts-model. Statistical analyses included 
      pairwise comparisons of L5/S1 DRG vs. spinal nerve. Furthermore, distinct 
      physiological zones within the S1 DRG were compared (cell body rich area (CBRA) vs. 
      nerve fiber rich area (NFRA)). RESULTS: DRG showed a significantly increased 
      permeability compared to spinal nerve (K(trans) 3.8±1.5 10(-3)/min vs. 1.6±0.9 
      10(-3)/min, p-value: <0.001) combined with an increased interstitial leakage of 
      contrast agent into the extravascular-extracellular-space (Ve 38.1±19.2% vs. 
      17.3±9.9%, p-value: <0.001). Parameters showed no statistically significant 
      difference on DRG-level (L5 vs. S1; p-value: 0.62 (K(trans)); 0.17 (Ve)) and -side 
      (left vs. right; p-value: 0.25 (K(trans)); 0.79 (Ve)). Female gender was associated 
      with a significantly increased permeability (K(trans) female 4.3±1.4 10(-3)/min vs. 
      male 3.4±0.9 10(-3)/min, p-value: <0.05) but no statistically significant 
      differences in interstitial leakage (Ve female 40.1±14,1% vs. male 34.5±17.4%, 
      p-value: 0.24). DRG showed distinct spatial distribution patterns of perfusion: 
      K(trans) and Ve were significantly higher in the CBRA than in the NFRA (K(trans) 
      4.4±1.8 10(-3)/min vs. 1.7±1.2 10(-3)/min, p-value: <0.001 and Ve 40.9±21.3% vs. 
      15.1±11.7%, p-value: <0.001). CONCLUSION: Non-invasive and in-vivo measurement of 
      human DRG perfusion by MRI is a feasible technique. DRG show substantially higher 
      permeability and interstitial leakage than spinal nerves. Even distinct 
      physiological perfusion patterns for different microstructural compartments could be 
      observed within the DRG. The technique may become particularly useful for future 
      research on the poorly understood human sensory neuropathies and pain syndromes.

LID - 10.1007/s12194-019-00528-4 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether the intratemporal facial nerve 
      could be delineated on 9.4 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using T2-weighted and 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI using a b value of 3000 and an isotropic 
      resolution of 0.4 mm(3) on a 9.4 T MRI scanner was performed on a whole-block 
      celloidin-embedded cadaveric temporal bone specimen of a 1-year-old infant with 
      normal temporal bones. The labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid segments of the 
      facial nerve and the chorda tympani nerve were readily depicted on DTI. Therefore, 
      DTI performed using a high b value on a high-field strength MRI scanner could help 
      evaluate the intratemporal facial nerve in whole temporal bone ex vivo specimens.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Brachial Plexus: A Comparison between 
      Readout-segmented and Conventional Single-shot Echo-planar Imaging.

AB  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) adds functional information to morphological 
      magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in the assessment of the brachial nerve plexus. 
      To determine the most appropriate pulse sequence in scan times suited for diagnostic 
      imaging in clinical routine, we compared image quality between simultaneous 
      multi-slice readout-segmented (rs-DTI) and conventional single-shot (ss-DTI) 
      echo-planar imaging techniques. METHODS: Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved 
      study including 10 healthy volunteers. The supraclavicular brachial plexus, covering 
      the nerve roots and trunks from C5 to C7, was imaged on both sides with rs-DTI and 
      ss-DTI. Both sequences were acquired in scan times <7 min with b-values of 900 
      s/mm(2) and with isotropic spatial resolution. RESULTS: In rs-DTI image, the overall 
      quality was significantly better and distortion artifacts were significantly lower 
      (P = 0.001-0.002 and P = 0.001-0.002, respectively) for both readers. In ss-DTI, a 
      trend toward lower degree of ghosting and motion artifacts was elicited (reader 1, P 
      = 0.121; reader 2, P = 0.264). No significant differences between the two DTI 
      techniques were found for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratios 
      (CNR) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (P ≥ 0.475, P ≥ 0.624, and P ≥ 0.169, 
      respectively). Interreader agreement for all examined parameters and all sequences 
      ranged from intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.064 to 0.905 and Kappa 0.40 
      to 0.851. CONCLUSION: Incomparable acquisition times rs-DTI showed higher image 
      quality and less distortion artifacts than ss-DTI. The trend toward a higher degree 
      of ghosting and motion artifacts in rs-DTI did not deteriorate image quality to a 
      significant degree. Thus, rs-DTI should be considered for functional MRN of the 
      brachial plexus.

TI  - MRI shows thickening and altered diffusion in the median and ulnar nerves in 
      multifocal motor neuropathy.
PG  - 2216-2224
LID - 10.1007/s00330-016-4575-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study disease mechanisms in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the median 
      and ulnar nerves. METHODS: We enrolled ten MMN patients, ten patients with 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ten healthy controls (HCs). Patients 
      underwent MRI (in a prone position) and nerve conduction studies. DTI and 
      fat-suppressed T2-weighted scans of the forearms were performed on a 3.0T MRI 
      scanner. Fibre tractography of the median and ulnar nerves was performed to extract 
      diffusion parameters: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial 
      (RD) diffusivity. Cross-sectional areas (CSA) were measured on T2-weighted scans. 
      RESULTS: Forty-five out of 60 arms were included in the analysis. AD was 
      significantly lower in MMN patients (2.20 ± 0.12 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) compared to ALS 
      patients (2.31 ± 0.17 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; p < 0.05) and HCs 
      (2.31± 0.17 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; p < 0.05). Segmental analysis showed significant 
      restriction of AD, RD and MD (p < 0.005) in the proximal third of the nerves. CSA 
      was significantly larger in MMN patients compared to ALS patients and HCs 
      (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Thickening of nerves is compatible with changes in the 
      myelin sheath structure, whereas lowered AD values suggest axonal dysfunction. These 
      findings suggest that myelin and axons are diffusely involved in MMN pathogenesis. 
      KEY POINTS: • Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging provides quantitative information 
      about multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). • Diffusion tensor imaging allows 
      non-invasive evaluation of the forearm nerves in MMN. • Nerve thickening and lowered 
      diffusion parameters suggests myelin and axonal changes. • This study can help to 
      provide insight into pathological mechanisms of MMN.

TI  - Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking for facial nerve identification 
      in vestibular schwannoma: a systematic review on its evolution and current status 
      with a pooled data analysis of surgical concordance rates.
PG  - E5

AB  - OBJECTIVE Total tumor excision with the preservation of neurological function and 
      quality of life is the goal of modern-day vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery. 
      Postoperative facial nerve (FN) paralysis is a devastating complication of VS 
      surgery. Determining the course of the FN in relation to a VS preoperatively is 
      invaluable to the neurosurgeon and is likely to enhance surgical safety with respect 
      to FN function. Diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking (DTI-FT) technology is 
      slowly gaining traction as a viable tool for preoperative FN visualization in 
      patients with VS. METHODS A systematic review of the literature in the PubMed, 
      Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was performed in accordance with 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      guidelines, and those studies that preoperatively localized the FN in relation to a 
      VS using the DTI-FT technique and verified those preoperative FN tracking results by 
      using microscopic observation and electrophysiological monitoring during 
      microsurgery were included. A pooled analysis of studies was performed to calculate 
      the surgical concordance rate (accuracy) of DTI-FT technology for FN localization. 
      RESULTS Fourteen studies included 234 VS patients (male/female ratio 1:1.4, age 
      range 17-75 years) who had undergone preoperative DTI-FT for FN identification. The 
      mean tumor size among the studies ranged from 29 to 41.3 mm. Preoperative DTI-FT 
      could not visualize the FN tract in 8 patients (3.4%) and its findings could not be 
      verified in 3 patients (1.2%), were verified but discordant in 18 patients (7.6%), 
      and were verified and concordant in 205 patients (87.1%). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative 
      DTI-FT for FN identification is a useful adjunct in the surgical planning for large 
      VSs (> 2.5 cm). A pooled analysis showed that DTI-FT successfully identifies the 
      complete FN course in 96.6% of VSs (226 of 234 cases) and that FN identification by 
      DTI-FT is accurate in 90.6% of cases (205 of 226 cases). Larger studies with 
      DTI-FT-integrated neuronavigation are required to look at the direct benefit offered 
      by this specific technique in preserving postoperative FN function.

TI  - Comparison of multi-shot and single shot echo-planar diffusion tensor techniques for 
      the optic pathway in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.
PG  - 431-441
LID - 10.1007/s00234-019-02164-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may be helpful in assessing optic pathway 
      integrity as a marker for treatment in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients with 
      optic gliomas (OG). However, susceptibility artifacts are common in typical 
      single-shot echo planar imaging (ssDTI). A readout-segmented multi-shot EPI 
      technique (rsDTI) was utilized to minimize susceptibility distortions of the skull 
      base and improve quantitative metrics. METHODS: Healthy controls, children with NF1 
      without OG, and NF1 with OG ± visual symptoms were included. All subjects were 
      scanned with both rsDTI and ssDTI sequences sequentially. Diffusion metrics and 
      deterministic fiber tracking were calculated. Tract count, volume, and length were 
      also compared by a two-factor mixed ANOVA. RESULTS: Five healthy controls, 7 NF1 
      children without OG, and 12 NF1 children with OG were imaged. Six OG patients had 
      visual symptoms. Four subjects had no detectable optic pathway fibers on ssDTI due 
      to susceptibility, for which rsDTI was able to delineate. Tract count (p < 0.001), 
      tract volume (p < 0.001), and FA (P < 0.001) were significantly higher for rsDTI 
      versus ssDTI for all subjects. MD (p < 0.001) and RD (p < 0.001) were significantly 
      lower for rsDTI vs ssDTI. Finally, MD, AD, and RD had a significantly lower 
      difference in NF1 children with visual symptoms compared to NF1 children without 
      visual symptoms only on ssDTI scans. CONCLUSION: DTI with readout-segmented 
      multi-shot EPI technique can better visualize the optic pathway and allow more 
      confident measurements of anisotropy in NF1 patients. This is shown by a significant 
      increase in FA, tract count, and volume with rsDTI versus ssDTI.

TI  - Magnetization transfer-based 3D visualization of foot peripheral nerves.
PG  - 1234-7
LID - 10.1002/jmri.23828 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate magnetization transfer (MT) effects as a new source of 
      contrast for imaging and tracking of peripheral foot nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Two sets of 3D spoiled gradient-echo images acquired with and without a saturation 
      pulse were used to generate MT ratio (MTR) maps of 260 μm in-plane resolution for 
      eight volunteers at 3T. Scan parameters were adjusted to minimize signal loss due to 
      T2 dephasing, and a dedicated coil was used to improve the inherently low 
      signal-to-noise ratio of small voxels. Resulting MTR values in foot nerves were 
      compared with those in surrounding muscle tissue. RESULTS: Average MTR values for 
      muscle (45.5 ± 1.4%) and nerve (21.4 ± 3.1%) were significantly different (P < 
      0.0001). In general, the difference in MTR values was sufficiently large to allow 
      for intensity-based segmentation and tracking of foot nerves in individual subjects. 
      This procedure was termed MT-based 3D visualization. CONCLUSION: The MTR serves as a 
      new source of contrast for imaging of peripheral foot nerves and provides a means 
      for high spatial resolution tracking of these structures. The proposed methodology 
      is directly applicable on standard clinical MR scanners and could be applied to 
      systemic pathologies, such as diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate functional and morphometric magnetic resonance neurography of 
      the dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve segments in patients with Fabry 
      painful neuropathy. METHODS: In this prospective study, the lumbosacral dorsal root 
      ganglia and proximal peripheral nerve segments of the lower extremity were examined 
      in 11 male patients with Fabry disease by a standardized 3T magnetic resonance 
      neurography protocol. Volumes of L3 to S2 dorsal root ganglia, perfusion parameters 
      of L5-S1 dorsal root ganglia and the spinal nerve L5, and the cross-sectional area 
      of the proximal sciatic nerve were compared to healthy controls. RESULTS: Dorsal 
      root ganglia of patients with Fabry disease were symmetrically enlarged by 78% (L3), 
      94% (L4), 122% (L5), 115% (S1), and 119% (S2) (p < 0.001). In addition, permeability 
      of the blood-tissue interface was decreased by 53% (p < 0.001). This finding was 
      most pronounced in the peripheral zone of the dorsal root ganglion containing the 
      cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons (p < 0.001). Spinal nerve permeability 
      showed no difference between patients with Fabry disease and controls (p = 0.7). The 
      sciatic nerve of patients with Fabry disease at the thigh level showed an increase 
      in cross-sectional area by 48% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Fabry disease 
      have severely enlarged dorsal root ganglia with dysfunctional perfusion. This may be 
      due to glycolipid accumulation in the dorsal root ganglia mediating direct 
      neurotoxic effects and decreased neuronal blood supply. These alterations were less 
      pronounced in peripheral nerve segments. Thus, the dorsal root ganglion might play a 
      key pathophysiologic role in the development of neuropathy and pain in Fabry 
      disease.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy: 
      Diagnostic Accuracy and Correlation With Electrophysiology.
PG  - 701-707
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000394 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to assess diagnostic accuracy of diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), to 
      correlate DTI with electrophysiological parameters, and to evaluate whether radial 
      diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) might serve as specific biomarkers of 
      demyelinating and axonal pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study 
      was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was 
      obtained from all participants. Magnetic resonance neurography of upper and lower 
      extremity nerves (median, ulnar, radial, sciatic, tibial) was performed by 
      single-shot DTI sequences at 3.0 T in 18 patients with a diagnosis of CIDP and 18 
      healthy controls, matched to age and sex. The scalar readout parameters nerve 
      fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), RD, and AD were obtained after 
      manual segmentation and postprocessing and compared between patients and controls. 
      Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and 
      cutoff values were calculated by maximizing the Youden index. All patients underwent 
      a complementary electroneurography and correlation of electrophysiological markers 
      and DTI parameters was analyzed and described by Pearson and Spearman coefficients. 
      RESULTS: Nerve FA was decreased to a mean of 0.42 ± 0.08 in patients compared with 
      0.52 ± 0.04 in healthy controls (P < 0.001). This decrease in FA was a result of an 
      increase of RD (P = 0.02), whereas AD did not differ between the two groups. Of all 
      DTI parameters, FA showed best diagnostic accuracy with a receiver operating 
      characteristic area under the curve of 0.90. Optimal cutoff for an average FA of all 
      analyzed nerves was 0.47, yielding a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.94. 
      Fractional anisotropy and RD correlated strongly with electrophysiological markers 
      of demyelination, whereas AD did not correlate with markers of axonal neuropathy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging yields valid quantitative biomarkers in CIDP 
      and might aid in diagnosis with high diagnostic accuracy. Fractional anisotropy and 
      RD may serve as parameters of myelin sheath integrity, but AD is unable to reflect 
      axonal damage in CIDP.

TI  - Oscillating diffusion-encoding with a high gradient-amplitude and high slew-rate 
      head-only gradient for human brain imaging.
PG  - 950-965
LID - 10.1002/mrm.28180 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigate the importance of high gradient-amplitude and high slew-rate 
      on oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) diffusion imaging for human brain imaging 
      and evaluate human brain imaging with OGSE on the MAGNUS head-gradient insert (200 
      mT/m amplitude and 500 T/m/s slew rate). METHODS: Simulations with cosine-modulated 
      and trapezoidal-cosine OGSE at various gradient amplitudes and slew rates were 
      performed. Six healthy subjects were imaged with the MAGNUS gradient at 3T with OGSE 
      at frequencies up to 100 Hz and b = 450 s/mm(2) . Comparisons were made against 
      standard pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) diffusion in vivo and in an isotropic 
      diffusion phantom. RESULTS: Simulations show that to achieve high frequency and 
      b-value simultaneously for OGSE, high gradient amplitude, high slew rates, and high 
      peripheral nerve stimulation limits are required. A strong linear trend for 
      increased diffusivity (mean: 8-19%, radial: 9-27%, parallel: 8-15%) was observed in 
      normal white matter with OGSE (20 Hz to 100 Hz) as compared to PGSE. Linear fitting 
      to frequency provided excellent correlation, and using a short-range disorder model 
      provided radial long-term diffusivities of D(∞,MD) = 911 ± 72 µm(2) /s, D(∞,PD) = 
      1519 ± 164 µm(2) /s, and D(∞,RD) = 640 ± 111 µm(2) /s and correlation lengths of 
      l(c) (,MD) = 0.802 ± 0.156 µm, l(c) (,PD) = 0.837 ± 0.172 µm, and l(c) (,RD) = 0.780 
      ± 0.174 µm. Diffusivity changes with OGSE frequency were negligible in the phantom, 
      as expected. CONCLUSION: The high gradient amplitude, high slew rate, and high 
      peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds of the MAGNUS head-gradient enables OGSE 
      acquisition for in vivo human brain imaging.

TI  - A study protocol on nerve mobilization induced diffusion tensor imaging values in 
      posterior tibial nerve in healthy controls and in patients with diabetic 
      neuropathy-multigroup pretest posttest design.
PG  - 100451

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic neuropathy is the commonest chronic disabling complication of 
      diabetes which may lead to amputation and compromising patient's quality of life. It 
      is characterized by pain, sensation loss associated with neural edema. Diffusion 
      tensor imaging parameter i.e. fraction anisotropy determines the free water proton 
      diffusion in the healthy nerve. Since the diabetes leads to altered 
      mechanosensitivity of the posterior tibial nerve thereby, might interferes with the 
      water molecules movement. Therefore the present clinical trial will provide the 
      evidence of improving the diffusion tensor imaging in the diabetic neuropathy 
      directly by targeting the nerve through nerve mobilization treatment. METHODS: 
      Participants with Type II Diabetes Mellitus induced peripheral neuropathy will be 
      selected randomly on the basis of eligibility criteria and informed consent will be 
      taken. Participants will be recruited into three groups. Group A (experimental group 
      A) will receive neural mobilization technique, Group B (experimental group B) will 
      receive conventional therapy and Group C (control group) will receive sham treatment 
      for 3 weeks. MRI technique, Visual analogue scale and neuropathy specific quality of 
      life questionnaire will be used as assessment tools. Assessment will be taken at 
      baseline and post intervention. CONCLUSION: this clinical trial will provide the 
      evidence of efficacy of nerve mobilization in determining the diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) changes in the posterior tibial nerve in patients with diabetic 
      neuropathy. This trial will also be the first one in itself to look at the treatment 
      induced DTI changes in the peripheral nerve. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing 
      peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. We assessed the changes in the DTI parameters 
      and histological analyses after nerve injury to examine degeneration and 
      regeneration in the rat sciatic nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI), 16 rats were randomly divided into two groups: group P 
      (permanently crushed; n = 7) and group T (temporally crushed; n = 9). Serial MRI of 
      the right leg was performed before the operation, and then performed at the 
      timepoints of 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the crush injury. The changes in fractional 
      anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (λ(∥)), and radial diffusivity (λ(⟂)) were 
      quantified. For histological analyses, the number of axons and the myelinated axon 
      areas were quantified. RESULTS: Decreased FA and increased λ(⟂) were observed in the 
      degenerative phase, and increased FA and decreased λ(⟂) were observed in the 
      regenerative phase. The changes in FA and λ(⟂) were strongly correlated with 
      histological changes, including axonal and myelin regeneration. CONCLUSION: DTI 
      parameters, especially λ(⟂) , can be good indicators for peripheral nerve 
      regeneration and can be applied as noninvasive diagnostic tools for a variety of 
      neurological diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathies refer to a group of disorders in which there is 
      damage to the nerves of the peripheral nervous system. Electrophysiologic studies 
      are the main stay for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies. However, direct 
      visualization of the nerves is possible with exact localization of site of disease 
      with high-resolution ultrasonography (USG) and 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) scanner, and newer magnetic resonance (MR) sequences. METHODS: We performed a 
      cross-sectional study including 55 patients and 64 nerves with upper limb peripheral 
      neuropathies. All patients included underwent high-resolution focused USG of the 
      nerves and MR neurography. A nerve conduction velocity study was performed for 
      reference. RESULTS: The diagnostic confidence of the turbo spin echo T2-weighted 
      (T2W) MR sequence was seen to be highest, with a sensitivity of 95.31%, whereas it 
      was 81.25% for USG. Continuity of the nerve in patients with traumatic neuropathy 
      was seen in 65.7% and 62.86% (22/35) nerves on MRI and USG, respectively. 
      T1-weighted and T2W MR sequences were seen to be equally effective in establishing 
      the continuity of the nerve. Increase in the caliber/thickening was seen in 77% of 
      cases on MRI and 73.8% of cases on USG. Neuroma formation was seen equally on both 
      MR and USG in 60.66%. We consistently found low fractional anisotropy (FA) values at 
      the site of disease. CONCLUSIONS: USG is a sensitive technique to diagnose 
      peripheral neuropathies and it should be used as a screening modality for focused MR 
      to be performed later. Turbo spin echo T2W fast spin has the highest sensitivity to 
      identify nerve disease and is comparable with nerve conduction studies. Among the 
      newer sequences, diffusion tensor imaging should be performed to increase diagnostic 
      confidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated diffusion tensor imaging tractography 
      of cranial nerves (CNs). Spatial and angular resolution, however, is limited with 
      this modality. A substantial improvement in image resolution can be achieved with 
      high-angle diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and atlas-based fiber tracking to 
      provide detailed trajectories of CNs. OBJECTIVE: To use high-definition fiber 
      tractography to identify CNs in healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors. 
      METHODS: Five neurologically healthy adults and 3 patients with brain tumors were 
      scanned with diffusion spectrum imaging that allowed high-angular-resolution fiber 
      tracking. In addition, a 488-subject diffusion magnetic resonance imaging template 
      constructed from the Human Connectome Project data was used to conduct atlas space 
      fiber tracking of CNs. RESULTS: The cisternal portions of most CNs were tracked and 
      visualized in each healthy subject and in atlas fiber tracking. The entire optic 
      radiation, medial longitudinal fasciculus, spinal trigeminal nucleus/tract, 
      petroclival portion of the abducens nerve, and intrabrainstem portion of the facial 
      nerve from the root exit zone to the adjacent abducens nucleus were identified. This 
      suggested that the high-angular-resolution fiber tracking was able to distinguish 
      the facial nerve from the vestibulocochlear nerve complex. The tractography clearly 
      visualized CNs displaced by brain tumors. These tractography findings were confirmed 
      intraoperatively. CONCLUSION: Using high-angular-resolution fiber tracking and 
      atlas-based fiber tracking, we were able to identify all CNs in unprecedented 
      detail. This implies its potential in localization of CNs during surgical planning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the cross-sectional area of the 
      anconeus epitrochlearis muscle (AEM), cubital tunnel, and ulnar nerve with the elbow 
      in extension in patients with and without ulnar neuropathy. METHODS: We performed a 
      retrospective, level IV review of elbow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. 
      Elbow MRI studies of 32 patients with an AEM (26 men and 6 women, aged 18-60 years), 
      32 randomly selected patients without an AEM (aged 16-71 years), and 32 patients 
      with clinical ulnar neuritis (22 men and 10 women, aged 24-76 years) were reviewed. 
      We evaluated the ulnar nerve cross-sectional area proximal to, within, and distal to 
      the cubital tunnel; AEM cross-sectional area; and cubital tunnel cross-sectional 
      area. RESULTS: We found no significant difference in the nerve caliber between 
      patients with and without an AEM. No correlation was found between the AEM 
      cross-sectional area and ulnar nerve cross-sectional area within the cubital tunnel 
      (r = 0.14). The mean cubital tunnel cross-sectional area was larger in patients with 
      an AEM. Only 4 of the 32 patients with an AEM had findings of ulnar neuritis on MRI. 
      Of the 32 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ulnar neuritis, only 2 had an AEM. 
      CONCLUSIONS: With the elbow in extension, the presence or cross-sectional area of an 
      AEM does not correlate with the area of the ulnar nerve or cubital tunnel. Only a 
      small number of individuals with MRI evidence of an AEM had clinical evidence of 
      ulnar neuropathy. Likewise, MRI evidence of an AEM was found in only a small number 
      of individuals with clinical evidence of ulnar neuropathy.

AB  - The emergence of diffusion, structural, and functional neuroimaging methods has 
      enabled major multi-site efforts to map the human connectome, which has heretofore 
      been defined as containing all neural connections in the central nervous system 
      (CNS). However, these efforts are not structured to examine the richness and 
      complexity of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which arguably forms the 
      (neglected) rest of the connectome. Despite increasing interest in an atlas of the 
      spinal cord (SC) and PNS which is simultaneously stereotactic, interactive, 
      electronically dissectible, scalable, population-based and deformable, little 
      attention has thus far been devoted to this task of critical importance. 
      Nevertheless, the atlasing of these complete neural structures is essential for 
      neurosurgical planning, neurological localization, and for mapping those components 
      of the human connectome located outside of the CNS. Here we recommend a modification 
      to the definition of the human connectome to include the SC and PNS, and argue for 
      the creation of an inclusive atlas to complement current efforts to map the brain's 
      human connectome, to enhance clinical education, and to assist progress in 
      neuroscience research. In addition to providing a critical overview of existing 
      neuroimaging techniques, image processing methodologies and algorithmic advances 
      which can be combined for the creation of a full connectome atlas, we outline a 
      blueprint for ultimately mapping the entire human nervous system and, thereby, for 
      filling a critical gap in our scientific knowledge of neural connectivity.

TI  - Anatomical evaluation of lumbar nerves using diffusion tensor imaging and 
      implications of lateral decubitus for lateral transpsoas approach.
PG  - 2804-2810

AB  - PURPOSE: Recently, lateral interbody fusion (LIF) has become more prevalent, and 
      evaluation of lumbar nerves has taken on new importance. We report on the assessment 
      of anatomical relationships between lumbar nerves and vertebral bodies using 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Fifty patients with degenerative lumbar 
      disease and ten healthy subjects underwent DTI. In patients with lumbar degenerative 
      disease, we studied nerve courses with patients in the supine positions and with 
      hips flexed. In healthy subjects, we evaluated nerve courses in three different 
      positions: supine with hips flexed (the standard position for MRI); supine with hips 
      extended; and the right lateral decubitus position with hips flexed. In conjunction 
      with tractography from L3 to L5 using T2-weighted sagittal imaging, the vertebral 
      body anteroposterior span was divided into four equally wide zones, with six total 
      zones defined, including an anterior and a posterior zone (zone A, zones 1-4, zone 
      P). We used this to characterize nerve courses at disc levels L3/4, L4/5, and L5/S1. 
      RESULTS: In patients with degenerative lumbar disease, in the supine position with 
      hips flexed, all lumbar nerve roots were located posterior to the vertebral body 
      centers in L3/4 and L4/5. In healthy individuals, the L3/4 nerve courses were 
      displaced forward in hips extended compared with the standard position, whereas in 
      the lateral decubitus position, the L4/5 and L5/S nerve courses were displaced 
      posteriorly compared with the standard position. CONCLUSIONS: The L3/4 and L4/5 
      nerve roots are located posterior to the vertebral body center. These were found to 
      be offset to the rear when the hip is flexed or the lateral decubitus position is 
      assumed. The present study is the first to elucidate changes in the course of the 
      lumbar nerves as this varies by position. The lateral decubitus position or the 
      position supine with hips flexed may be useful for avoiding nerve damage in a direct 
      lateral transpsoas approach. Preoperative DTI seems to be useful in evaluating the 
      lumbar nerve course as it relates anatomically to the vertebral body.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the applicability of nerve ultrasound and magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). 
      METHODS: We systematically examined several nerves with ultrasound and the lumbar 
      roots and tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa of nine CIDP patients with MRI 
      additionally to the nerve conduction studies. RESULTS: Patients with overall 
      disability sum score (ODSS) 2-3 were characterised by normal fascicular structure in 
      MRI and ultrasound. Patients with higher ODSS showed isolated enlarged fascicles and 
      increased cross sectional area (CSA) of the peripheral nerves and of the diameter of 
      the cauda equina and L5 root, whereas two of them showed atrophic fascicles in both 
      imaging techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Nerve ultrasound and MRI findings show the same 
      morphological fascicle alterations in peripheral nerves in correlation to ODSS. 
      Nerve ultrasound as an affordable tool, easy and quick to perform, could replace MRI 
      in daily routine for monitoring peripheral nerve morphology.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging findings of the median nerve before and after carpal tunnel 
      corticosteroid injection in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome: a preliminary 
      study.
PG  - 347-355
LID - 10.1177/0284185118784977 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid injections are a popular technique for carpal tunnel 
      syndrome (CTS) treatment and are believed to provide rapid symptom relief. PURPOSE: 
      To use magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI) to determine the 
      association between diffusion values of the median nerve (MN) at several anatomic 
      locations and symptom relief in patients with CTS following corticosteroid 
      injection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MR-DTI was performed on 15 wrists of 12 patients 
      with CTS before and two weeks after ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections. We 
      recorded the patients' clinical data including sex, age, side of injection, 
      satisfaction, and symptom relief. Satisfaction and symptom relief were rated using a 
      Likert scale and the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) scale. 
      Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the MN at the 
      levels of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), pisiform bone, and hamate bone were 
      determined. RESULTS: All patients had ≥50% satisfaction on the injection side. In 
      comparison with baseline values, post-injection ADC was significantly lower ( 
      P = 0.001) but FA was not significantly higher ( P = 0.11) at the pisiform bone 
      level on the injected wrists. At the DRUJ and hamate bone levels, no obvious 
      inter-scan change in FA and ADC ( P > 0.05) was observed. The decrease in ADC at the 
      pisiform bone level strongly correlated with the decrease in BCTQ scores (r = 0.628; 
      P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Symptom relief in patients with CTS receiving corticosteroid 
      injection is related to the change in ADC of the median nerve at the level of the 
      pisiform bone, as determined using MR-DTI.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography of distal peripheral nerves at 3 T.
PG  - 2315-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied whether distal peripheral nerves could be imaged using 
      quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a 3-T MRI scanner, and visualized 
      using tractography. METHODS: Altogether 6 healthy subjects were studied. The 
      diffusion was quantified with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) maps, and the direction of main diffusivity was visualized with 
      color-coded orientation maps and tractography. RESULTS: We present the first DTI and 
      tractography results of human distal peripheral nerves. The courses of median, 
      ulnar, and radial nerves in the upper limb and of tibial and peroneal nerves in the 
      lower limb were first analyzed quantifying ADC and FA, and then visualized in 3D 
      with tractography. Tractography illustrated nicely the 3D courses of both upper and 
      lower limb nerves which were reliably distinguished from the surrounding muscle 
      tissue and ligaments. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative DTI and tractography can be used to 
      image and visualize distal peripheral nerves. SIGNIFICANCE: DTI is a quantitative 
      method that could provide useful information for the diagnosis and follow-up of 
      nerve lesions, entrapments, and regeneration. Peripheral nerves as well-delineated 
      structures also containing abundant branching into bundles of different diameters, 
      could be used as 'living phantoms' for testing and validating different tractography 
      methods.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of the roots of the brachial plexus: a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis of normative values.
PG  - 419-431
LID - 10.1007/s40336-020-00393-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) characterises tissue 
      microstructure and provides proxy measures of myelination, axon diameter, fibre 
      density and organisation. This may be valuable in the assessment of the roots of the 
      brachial plexus in health and disease. Therefore, there is a need to define the 
      normal DTI values. METHODS: The literature was systematically searched for studies 
      of asymptomatic adults who underwent DTI of the brachial plexus. Participant 
      characteristics, scanning protocols, and measurements of the fractional anisotropy 
      (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of each spinal root were extracted by two independent 
      review authors. Generalised linear modelling was used to estimate the effect of 
      experimental conditions on the FA and MD. Meta-analysis of root-level estimates was 
      performed using Cohen's method with random effects. RESULTS: Nine articles, 
      describing 316 adults (1:1 male:female) of mean age 35 years (SD 6) were included. 
      Increments of ten diffusion sensitising gradient directions reduced the mean FA by 
      0.01 (95% CI 0.01, 0.03). Each year of life reduced the mean MD by 0.03 × 10(-3) 
      mm(2)/s (95% CI 0.01, 0.04). At 3-T, the pooled mean FA of the roots was 0.36 (95% 
      CI 0.34, 0.38; I (2) 98%). The pooled mean MD of the roots was 1.51 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s 
      (95% CI 1.45, 1.56; I (2) 99%). CONCLUSIONS: The FA and MD of the roots of the 
      brachial plexus vary according to experimental conditions and participant factors. 
      We provide summary estimates of the normative values in different conditions which 
      may be valuable to researchers and clinicians alike.

TI  - Isotropic resolution diffusion tensor imaging of lumbosacral and sciatic nerves 
      using a phase-corrected diffusion-prepared 3D turbo spin echo.
PG  - 609-618
LID - 10.1002/mrm.27072 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To perform in vivo isotropic-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 
      lumbosacral and sciatic nerves with a phase-navigated diffusion-prepared (DP) 3D 
      turbo spin echo (TSE) acquisition and modified reconstruction incorporating 
      intershot phase-error correction and to investigate the improvement on image quality 
      and diffusion quantification with the proposed phase correction. METHODS: 
      Phase-navigated DP 3D TSE included magnitude stabilizers to minimize motion and 
      eddy-current effects on the signal magnitude. Phase navigation of motion-induced 
      phase errors was introduced before readout in 3D TSE. DTI of lower back nerves was 
      performed in vivo using 3D TSE and single-shot echo planar imaging (ss-EPI) in 13 
      subjects. Diffusion data were phase-corrected per k(z) plane with respect to T(2) 
      -weighted data. The effects of motion-induced phase errors on DTI quantification was 
      assessed for 3D TSE and compared with ss-EPI. RESULTS: Non-phase-corrected 3D TSE 
      resulted in artifacts in diffusion-weighted images and overestimated DTI parameters 
      in the sciatic nerve (mean diffusivity [MD] = 2.06 ± 0.45). Phase correction of 3D 
      TSE DTI data resulted in reductions in all DTI parameters (MD = 1.73 ± 0.26) of 
      statistical significance (P ≤ 0.001) and in closer agreement with ss-EPI DTI 
      parameters (MD = 1.62 ± 0.21). CONCLUSION: DP 3D TSE with phase correction allows 
      distortion-free isotropic diffusion imaging of lower back nerves with robustness to 
      motion-induced artifacts and DTI quantification errors. Magn Reson Med 80:609-618,

TI  - Lessons of ALS imaging: Pitfalls and future directions - A critical review.
PG  - 436-43
LID - 10.1016/j.nicl.2014.02.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While neuroimaging in ALS has gained unprecedented momentum in recent 
      years, little progress has been made in the development of viable diagnostic, 
      prognostic and monitoring markers. OBJECTIVES: To identify and discuss the common 
      pitfalls in ALS imaging studies and to reflect on optimal study designs based on 
      pioneering studies. METHODS: A "PubMed"-based literature search on ALS was 
      performed based on neuroimaging-related keywords. Study limitations were 
      systematically reviewed and classified so that stereotypical trends could be 
      identified. RESULTS: Common shortcomings, such as relatively small sample sizes, 
      statistically underpowered study designs, lack of disease controls, 
      poorly characterised patient cohorts and a large number of conflicting studies, 
      remain a significant challenge to the field. Imaging data of ALS continue to be 
      interpreted at a group-level, as opposed to meaningful individual-patient 
      inferences. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic, critical review of ALS imaging has identified 
      stereotypical shortcomings, the lessons of which should be considered in the design 
      of future prospective MRI studies. At a time when large multicentre studies are 
      underway a candid discussion of these factors is particularly timely.

TI  - Proximal nerve magnetization transfer MRI relates to disability in 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases.
PG  - 1545-53
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000919 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a novel magnetization 
      transfer ratio (MTR) MRI assay of the proximal sciatic nerve (SN), which is 
      inaccessible via current tools for assessing peripheral nerves, and (2) to evaluate 
      the resulting MTR values as a potential biomarker of myelin content changes in 
      patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases. METHODS: MTR was measured in the 
      SN of patients with CMT type 1A (CMT1A, n = 10), CMT type 2A (CMT2A, n = 3), 
      hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (n = 3), and healthy 
      controls (n = 21). Additional patients without a genetically confirmed subtype (n = 
      4), but whose family histories and electrophysiologic tests were consistent with 
      CMT, were also included. The relationship between MTR and clinical neuropathy scores 
      was assessed, and the interscan and inter-rater reliability of MTR was estimated. 
      RESULTS: Mean volumetric MTR values were significantly decreased in the SN of 
      patients with CMT1A (33.8 ± 3.3 percent units) and CMT2A (31.5 ± 1.9 percent units) 
      relative to controls (37.2 ± 2.3 percent units). A significant relationship between 
      MTR and disability scores was also detected (p = 0.01 for genetically confirmed 
      patients only, p = 0.04 for all patients). From interscan and inter-rater 
      reliability analyses, proximal nerve MTR values were repeatable at the slicewise and 
      mean volumetric levels. CONCLUSIONS: MTR measurements may be a viable biomarker of 
      proximal nerve pathology in patients with CMT.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate microstructural cerebral changes in children with 
      neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) based on T(2) relaxation time measurements at 3Tesla. 
      METHODS: From our dataset of pediatric MRI examinations at 3T 19 pediatric NF1 
      patients (1.9-14.3 years of age, 9 girls, 10 boys) were retrospectively selected and 
      compared with the previously published group of 44 healthy children (0-16 years of 
      age). MRI examination included a triple echo TSE sequence as basis for T(2) maps. 
      T(2) relaxation times were measured in 37 brain regions. RESULTS: Compared with 
      healthy controls, T(2) relaxation times had the tendency to be increased by 1.01% 
      (GM) to 11.85% (dentate nucleus) for NF1 patients. Only in posterior limb of the 
      internal capsule and parietooccipital white matter values were reduced. No 
      differences were observed between both hemispheres. Overall, no strong evidence 
      supporting a difference between NF1 patients with and without optic glioma or with 
      normal and impaired neuropsychological development was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Using 
      T(2) relaxation times it was possible to describe measurable microstructural 
      differences in multiple brain regions between NF1 patients and healthy children 
      regardless of whether signal abnormalities were visible on conventional images.

AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia, painful trigeminal neuropathy, and painful temporomandibular 
      disorders (TMDs) are chronic orofacial pain conditions that are thought to have 
      fundamentally different etiologies. Trigeminal neuralgia and neuropathy are thought 
      to arise from damage to or pressure on the trigeminal nerve, whereas TMD results 
      primarily from peripheral nociceptor activation. This study sought to assess the 
      volume and microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in these 3 conditions. In 9 
      neuralgia, 18 neuropathy, 20 TMD, and 26 healthy controls, the trigeminal root entry 
      zone was selected on high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and the 
      volume (mm(3)) calculated. Additionally, using diffusion-tensor images (DTIs), the 
      mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values of the trigeminal nerve root were 
      calculated. Trigeminal neuralgia patients displayed a significant (47%) decrease in 
      nerve volume but no change in DTI values. Conversely, trigeminal neuropathy subjects 
      displayed a significant (40%) increase in nerve volume but again no change in DTI 
      values. In contrast, TMD subjects displayed no change in volume or DTI values. The 
      data suggest that the changes occurring within the trigeminal nerve are not uniform 
      in all orofacial pain conditions. These structural and volume changes may have 
      implications in diagnosis and management of different forms of chronic orofacial 
      pain. PERSPECTIVE: This study reveals that neuropathic orofacial pain conditions are 
      associated with changes in trigeminal nerve volume, whereas non-neuropathic 
      orofacial pain is not associated with any change in nerve volume.

TI  - Fat fraction distribution in lower limb muscles of patients with CMT1A: A 
      quantitative MRI study.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000009013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively describe the MRI fat infiltration pattern of muscle 
      degeneration in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type 1A (CMT1A) disease and to look for 
      correlations with clinical variables. METHODS: MRI fat fraction was assessed in 
      lower-limb musculature of patients with CMT1A and healthy controls. More 
      particularly, 14 muscle compartments were selected at leg and thigh levels and for 
      proximal, distal, and medial slices. Muscle fat infiltration profile was determined 
      quantitatively in each muscle compartment and along the entire volume of acquisition 
      to determine a length-dependent gradient of fat infiltration. Clinical impairment 
      was evaluated with muscle strength measurements and CMT Examination Scores (CMTESs). 
      RESULTS: A total of 16 patients with CMT1A were enrolled and compared to 11 healthy 
      controls. Patients with CMT1A showed a larger muscle fat fraction at leg and thigh 
      levels with a proximal-to-distal gradient. At the leg level, the largest fat 
      infiltration was quantified in the anterior and lateral compartments. CMTES was 
      correlated with fat fraction, especially in the anterior compartment of leg muscles. 
      Strength of plantar flexion was also correlated with fat fraction of the posterior 
      compartments of leg muscles. CONCLUSION: On the basis of quantitative MRI 
      measurements combined with a dedicated segmentation method, muscle fat infiltration 
      quantified in patients with CMT1A disclosed a length-dependent peroneal-type pattern 
      of fat infiltration and was correlated to main clinical variables. Quantification of 
      fat fraction at different levels of the leg anterior compartment might be of 
      interest in future clinical trials.

TI  - Anatomical analysis of the pelvis to identify any predisposing anatomical factors 
      for ischiofemoral space pathology: a retrospective study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anatomical analysis of the hips and pelvis was performed using MRI to 
      evaluate morphological characteristics and associations between them. We identified 
      correlations between the ischiofemoral space (IFS), quadratus femoris space (QFS), 
      femoral version angle (FVA) and cervicodiaphyseal angle (CDA). METHODS: This study 
      involved a retrospective search of a database of consecutive reports of adult hip 
      MRI examinations carried out between January and September 2016. Patients with a 
      medical history likely to affect pelvic and hip morphometry were excluded. RESULTS: 
      A total of 137 adult patients were enrolled in the study (45.3% males and 54.7% 
      females), with a mean age of 50.16 ± 13.87 years. The mean IFS was 20.88 ± 5.96 mm, 
      mean QFS was 15.2 ± 6.18 mm, mean FVA was 12.43 ± 6.98, and mean CDA was 121.27 ± 
      4.6°. The IFS measurements were significantly correlated with femoral measurements 
      (p = 0.025). These visible differences showed a slight negative relationship 
      (-0.191), and females had a smaller distance between these anatomical structures 
      than males (p < 0.001). Females had a significantly smaller QFS than males (12.42 ± 
      5.94 vs 18.73 ± 4.48 mm, p = 0.000). There was a small but significant positive 
      relationship between CDA and FVA (p = 0.022), with a correlation coefficient of 
      0.195. CONCLUSION: A higher FVA was correlated with a smaller IFS. Furthermore, an 
      increase in the CDA appeared in tandem with an increase in the FVA. ADVANCES IN 
      KNOWLEDGE: A single conventional MRI sequence can alert us to how anatomical factors 
      could predispose individuals to a decrease in IFS.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging and T2 relaxometry of human median nerve at 7 Tesla.
PG  - 368-73
AB  - Measurements of T2 relaxation times in tissues have provided a unique, noninvasive 
      method to investigate the microenvironment of water molecules in vivo. As more 
      clinical imaging is performed at higher field strengths, tissue relaxation times 
      need to be reassessed in order to optimize tissue contrast. The purpose of this 
      study was to investigate the water proton T2 relaxation time in human median nerve 
      at 7 T. High-resolution images of the wrist were obtained using a home-built 
      dedicated microstrip coil. Gradient echo images provided a good anatomical 
      delineation of the wrist structure, with a clear definition of the median nerve, 
      tendons, bone, and connective tissue within the wrist in an acquisition time of 2 
      min. Measurements of the T2 relaxation time were performed with a spin echo imaging 
      sequence. The T2 relaxation time of the median nerve was 18.3 +/- 1.9 ms, which is 
      significantly shorter than the T2 measured in previous studies performed at 1.5 T 
      and 3 T. Further, the T2 relaxation time of the median nerve is shorter than the T2 
      relaxation time of other tissues, such as brain tissue, at the same field strength. 
      Since the T2 relaxation time of water protons is sensitive to the water 
      microenvironment, relaxation measurements and, in general, a more quantitative 
      magnetic resonance imaging approach might help in detecting and investigating 
      diseases of peripheral nervous system, such as compressive and inflammatory 
      neuropathies, in humans.

TI  - Fatigue in patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.
PG  - 1400-1409
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51133 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is caused 
      by a heterozygous deletion of peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene resulting in 
      focal sensorimotor deficits. Our lab has identified a disruption of myelin junctions 
      in excessively permeable myelin that impairs action potential propagation. This 
      mechanism is expected to cause fatigue in patients with HNPP. Therefore, the 
      objective was to characterize fatigue in patients with HNPP and determine the 
      relationship of fatigue to nerve pathology, disability, and quality of life. 
      METHODS: Nine females with HNPP participated in a single visit that included 
      genotyping, nerve conduction studies, neurological exam, quantitative magnetic 
      resonance imaging, and a physical therapy exam incorporating upper and lower 
      extremity function and survey measures of fatigue. This visit was followed by 
      2 weeks of ecological momentary assessment (wrist-worn device) that captured fatigue 
      ratings five times per day. RESULTS: Participants demonstrated mild neurological 
      impairment (CMTNS: 5.7 ± 2.8), yet reported high fatigue levels (average fatigue 
      intensity over 2 weeks: 5.9 out of 10). Higher fatigue levels were associated with 
      poorer quality of life and more pain. Higher fatigue was associated with 
      significantly greater distal nerve proton density changes on peripheral nerve MRI, 
      which is in line with hyper-permeable myelin in HNPP. INTERPRETATION: Fatigue is 
      common and severe among patients with HNPP whose disabilities are minimal by 
      conventional outcome measures. Therapeutic interventions targeting fatigue have the 
      potential to improve quality of life and may serve as a robust outcome measure to 
      show longitudinal changes for patients with HNPP.

      historical review and recent progress.
PG  - 880-5
LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.190241 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to critically review the clinical approach to distinguish 
      the sensory and motor nerve fascicles of the peripheral nerve system and to explore 
      potential novel techniques to meet the clinical needs. The principles and 
      shortcomings of the currently used methods for identification of sensory and motor 
      nerve fascicles, including nerve morphology, electrical stimulation, spectroscopy, 
      enzymohistochemistry staining (acetylcholinesterase [AchE], carbonic anhydrase [CA] 
      and choline acetyltransferase [ChAC] histochemistry staining methods), and 
      immunochemical staining were systematically reviewed. The progress in diffusion 
      tensor imaging, proteomic approaches, and quantum dots (QDs) assessment in clinical 
      applications to identify sensory or motor fascicles has been discussed. Traditional 
      methods such as physical and enzymohistochemical methods are not suitable for the 
      precise differentiation of sensory and motor nerve fascicles. Immunohistochemical 
      staining using AchE, CA, and ChAC is promising in differentiation of sensory and 
      motor nerve fascicles. Diffusion tensor imaging can reflect morphological details of 
      nerve fibers. Proteomics can reveal the dynamics of specific proteins discriminating 
      sensory and motor fascicles. QDs, with their size-dependent optical properties, make 
      them the ideal protein markers for identification of the sensory or motor nerves. 
      Diffusion tensor imaging, proteomics and QDs-imaging will facilitate the clinical 
      identification of motor and sensory nerve fascicles, help in improving surgical 
      success rates and assist in postoperative functional recovery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of Ultra-high field 
      [UHF] 7 Tesla [T] MRI as compared to 3T MRI in non-contrast enhanced [nCE] imaging 
      of structural anatomy in the elbow, forearm, and hand [upper extremity]. MATERIALS 
      AND METHOD: A wide range of sequences including T1 weighted [T1] volumetric 
      interpolate breath-hold exam [VIBE], T2 weighted [T2] double-echo steady state 
      [DESS], susceptibility weighted imaging [SWI], time-of-flight [TOF], diffusion 
      tensor imaging [DTI], and diffusion spectrum imaging [DSI] were optimized and 
      incorporated with a radiofrequency [RF] coil system composed of a transverse 
      electromagnetic [TEM] transmit coil combined with an 8-channel receive-only array 
      for 7T upper extremity [UE] imaging. In addition, Siemens optimized 
      protocol/sequences were used on a 3T scanner and the resulting images from T1 VIBE 
      and T2 DESS were compared to that obtained at 7T qualitatively and quantitatively 
      [SWI was only qualitatively compared]. DSI studio was utilized to identify nerves 
      based on analysis of diffusion weighted derived fractional anisotropy images. Images 
      of forearm vasculature were extracted using a paint grow manual segmentation method 
      based on MIPAV [Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization]. RESULTS: 
      High resolution and high quality signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] and contrast-to-noise 
      ratio [CNR]-images of the hand, forearm, and elbow were acquired with nearly 
      homogeneous 7T excitation. Measured [performed on the T1 VIBE and T2 DESS sequences] 
      SNR and CNR values were almost doubled at 7T vs. 3T. Cartilage, synovial fluid and 
      tendon structures could be seen with higher clarity in the 7T T1 and T2 weighted 
      images. SWI allowed high resolution and better quality imaging of large and medium 
      sized arteries and veins, capillary networks and arteriovenous anastomoses at 7T 
      when compared to 3T. 7T diffusion weighted sequence [not performed at 3T] 
      demonstrates that the forearm nerves are clearly delineated by fiber tractography. 
      The proper digital palmar arteries and superficial palmar arch could also be clearly 
      visualized using TOF nCE 7T MRI. CONCLUSION: Ultra-high resolution neurovascular 
      imaging in upper extremities is possible at 7T without use of renal toxic 
      intravenous contrast. 7T MRI can provide superior peripheral nerve [based on fiber 
      anisotropy and diffusion coefficient parameters derived from diffusion 
      tensor/spectrum imaging] and vascular [nCE MRA and vessel segmentation] imaging.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate large coverage magnetic resonance 
      neurography (MRN) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In 
      this prospective study, 18 patients with CIDP and 18 healthy controls were examined 
      by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 T. Lumbosacral plexus was imaged by a 
      T2-weighted 3D sequence and peripheral nerves of the upper and lower extremity by 
      axial T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences. Lesions were characterized by nerve 
      cross-sectional area (CSA) and T2-weighted signal (nT2). Additionally, T2 
      relaxometry of the sciatic nerve was performed using a multi-spin-echo sequence. All 
      patients received a complementary electrophysiological exam. Patients with CIDP 
      exhibited increased nerve CSA and nT2 compared to controls (p < 0.05) in a 
      proximally predominating pattern. Receiver operating characteristic analysis 
      revealed the best diagnostic accuracy for CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (AUC = 0.88) 
      and nT2 of the sciatic nerve (AUC = 0.88). CSA correlated with multiple 
      electrophysiological parameters of demyelinating neuropathy (F wave latency, nerve 
      conduction velocity) of sciatic and median nerve, while nT2 only correlated with F 
      wave latency of sciatic and not median nerve. T2 relaxometry indicated that MR 
      signal increase in CIDP was due to an increase in proton-spin-density (p < 0.05), 
      and not due to the increase in T2 relaxation time. Both nT2 and CSA might aid in the 
      diagnosis of CIDP, but CSA correlates more robustly with established 
      electrophysiological parameters for CIDP. Since the best diagnostic accuracy was 
      shown for proximal nerve locations, MRN may be a useful complementary tool in 
      selected CIDP cases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic potential of diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) for pathologies of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) through 
      clinical, electrophysiological and morphological evaluation of the median nerve. 
      METHODS: The present work was a multilevel prospective study involving 30 subjects, 
      15 of whom had carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and 15 healthy controls. All subjects 
      underwent clinical evaluation through administration of the Boston Carpal Tunnel 
      Questionnaire (BCTQ), electroneurography (ENG), 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging 
      with DTI, and calculation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) at the flexor retinaculum. Tractography was also performed for 
      three-dimensional reconstruction of the route of the median nerve through the carpal 
      tunnel. The degree of functional impairment was compared with the anatomical damage 
      to the median nerve according to ENG and DTI. RESULTS: FA and ADC were significantly 
      correlated with ENG parameters of CTS and BCTQ data. Mean FA and ADC values in the 
      CTS patients were 0.359±0.06 and 1.866±0.050×10(-3)mm(2)/s, respectively, vs 
      0.59±0.014 and 1.395±0.035×10(-3)mm(2)/s, respectively, in the controls. FA was 
      decreased and ADC increased in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls 
      (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: DTI parameters were clearly confirmed by both clinical and ENG 
      data and, therefore, may be used for the diagnosis of CTS.

TI  - Morphometric parameters and histological study of the filum terminale of adult human 
      cadavers and magnetic resonance images.
PG  - 609-619

AB  - BACKGROUND: Morphology and histology of filum terminale (FT) has a role in the 
      pathophysiology of tethered cord syndrome (TCS). This research was implemented to 
      investigate the morphometric parameters and histological structure of normal FT in 
      adult human cadavers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to correlate them 
      with the pathophysiology of TCS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty five adult human 
      cadavers (15 males, 10 females) and 100 MRI echo scans of lumbosacral region (50 
      males and 50 females), were used in this study. MRI patients were divided into 21-40 
      and 41-60 age groups. The cadavers were dissected at the prone position to explore 
      their fila. The length of FT, filum terminale internum (FTI), filum terminale 
      externum (FTE), vertebral level of beginning, dural piercing and termination of FT, 
      and the initial, midpoint, and mid-FTE diameters were determined. Four segments were 
      excised from lower conus, upper, middle, and lower thirds of FT. The specimens were 
      processed for light microscopic examination. Statistical analysis was done for these 
      parameters. RESULTS: MRI morphometrical parameters of FT, except FTI length, 
      revealed no age effect or sex differences, where length of FTI, FTE, initial 
      diameter, level of conus medullaris termination (CMT) and dural sac termination 
      (DST) were 174.1 ± 16.8, 75.8 ± 9.5, 1.6 ± 0.21, L1-2 and S2U in males and 166.9 ± 
      18.9, 74.1 ± 9.3, 1.53 ± 0.25, L1-2 and S2M vertebrae in females, respectively. 
      However, non-significant sex difference was observed in morphometric parameters of 
      cadaveric FT, where length of FTI and FTE, initial diameter, CMT and DST levels were 
      164.2 ± 11.6, 76.7 ± 8.1, 1.7 ± 0.14, L1L and S2U vertebrae in males and 159.2 ± 
      10.1, 71.02 ± 7.3, 1.6 ± 0.29, L1L and S2U in females, respectively. Moreover, CMT 
      below L2 vertebra was seen in 5% of MRI scans and 8% of cadavers. Also, the initial 
      diameter of FT > 2 mm was recorded in 7% of MRI and 8% of cadaveric cases. 
      Histologically, the structure of FT showed gradual reduction in nervous, glial, and 
      vascular tissues with converse increase in collagen content in FTE compared with 
      those of FTI. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the morphometric parameters and the 
      histological structure of FT are necessary for clinicians who dealing with diagnosis 
      or treatment of tethered cord syndrome.

TI  - Does the increased motion probing gradient directional diffusion tensor imaging of 
      lumbar nerves using multi-band SENSE improve the visualization and accuracy of FA 
      values?
PG  - 1693-1701
LID - 10.1007/s00586-020-06430-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is useful to evaluate lumbar nerves visually 
      and quantitatively. Multi-band sensitivity encoding (MB-SENSE) is a technique to 
      reduce the scan time. This study aimed to investigate if super-multi-gradient DTI 
      with multi-band sensitivity encoding (MB-SENSE) is better in evaluating lumbar 
      nerves than the conventional method. METHODS: The participants were 12 healthy 
      volunteers (mean age 33.6 years). In all subjects, DTI was performed using echo 
      planar imaging with different motion probing gradient (MPG) directions (15 without 
      MB, and 15, 32, 64, and 128 with MB) and the lumbar nerve roots were visualized with 
      tractography. In the five groups, we evaluated the resultant DTI both visually and 
      quantitatively. For visual measures, we counted the number of fluffs and disruptions 
      of the nerve fibers. For quantitative measures, the fractional anisotropy (FA) and 
      standard deviation of the fractional anisotropy (FA-SD) values at two regions 
      (proximal and distal) of the lumbar nerve roots were quantified and compared. 
      RESULTS: Among the five groups, the number of fluffs decreased as the number of MPG 
      directions increased. However, the number of disruptions showed no significant 
      differences. The FA-SD values decreased as the number of MPG directions increased, 
      indicating that the signal variation was reduced with multi-gradient directional 
      DTI. CONCLUSION: High-resolution multi-directional DTI with MB-SENSE may be useful 
      to visualize nerve entrapments and may allow for more accurate DTI parameter 
      quantification with opportunities for clinical diagnostic applications.

AB  - There is no imaging modality to quantitatively evaluate compressed cervical nerve 
      roots in cervical radiculopathy. Here we sought to evaluate the usefulness of 
      simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with nerve-sheath signal increased 
      with inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of relaxation-enhancement imaging 
      (SHINKEI-Quant) to evaluate compressed nerves quantitatively in patients with 
      cervical radiculopathy due to cervical disc hernia before microendoscopic surgery. 
      One patient with cervical radiculopathy due to cervical disc hernia before 
      microendoscopic surgery and 5 healthy subjects underwent simultaneous apparent T2 
      mapping and neurography with SHINKEI-Quant. The patient was a 49-year-old man with 
      severe right upper arm pain and numbness. Based on MRI images, we suspected right C7 
      radiculopathy due to C6-7 cervical disc hernia. The T2 relaxation times of the 
      cervical dorsal root ganglia of the brachial plexus bilaterally at C5-C8 were 
      measured. We observed no significant differences in T2 relaxation times between the 
      nerve roots on the left and right at each spinal level with values in healthy 
      subjects. In our patient, neurography revealed swelling of the right C7 nerve, and a 
      prolonged T2 relaxation time compared with that of the contralateral, unaffected C7 
      nerve. We performed microendoscopic surgery and the symptoms improved. We were able 
      to evaluate the injured nerve root quantitatively in a patient with cervical 
      radiculopathy using the SHINKEI-Quant technique, being the first study to our 
      knowledge to show the usefulness of this technique to evaluate cervical 
      radiculopathy quantitatively before microendoscopic surgery.

TI  - Reliability of Preoperative Prediction of the Location of the Facial Nerve Using 
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging-Fiber Tracking in Vestibular Schwannoma: A Systematic 
      Review and Meta-Analysis.

AB  - The popularization and application of microscopy, the in-depth study of the 
      microanatomy of the cerebellopontine angle, and the application of intraoperative 
      electrophysiological monitoring technology to preserve facial nerve function have 
      laid a solid foundation for the modern era of neurosurgery. The preoperative 
      prediction of the location of the facial nerve is a long-desired goal of 
      neurosurgeons. The advances in neuroimaging seem to be making this goal a reality. 
      Many studies investigating the reliability of the preoperative prediction of the 
      location of the facial nerve using diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking in 
      vestibular schwannoma have been reported in the last 20 years. The PubMed, Embase, 
      and Cochrane databases were searched for articles published before March 30, 2020. A 
      comprehensive review of published studies was carried out in accordance with 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. 
      Authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the reported data to 
      assess the reliability of the preoperative prediction of the location of the facial 
      nerve using diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking in vestibular schwannoma. The 
      data were analyzed using a fixed-effects model. The estimated overall intraoperative 
      verification concordance rate was 89.05% (95% confidence interval 85.06%-92.58%). 
      Preoperatively predicting the location of the facial nerve using diffusion tensor 
      imaging-fiber tracking in vestibular schwannoma is reliable, but the extent to which 
      it contributes to long-term facial nerve function is still unclear. To further 
      verify these results, studies with larger sample sizes are needed in the future, 
      especially prospective randomized controlled trials focusing on the long-term 
      functional preservation of the facial nerve.

TI  - Longitudinal Development of Peripapillary Hyper-Reflective Ovoid Masslike Structures 
      Suggests a Novel Pathological Pathway in Multiple Sclerosis.
PG  - 309-319
LID - 10.1002/ana.25782 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Peripapillary hyper-reflective ovoid masslike structures (PHOMS) are a 
      new spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) finding. METHODS: This 
      prospective, longitudinal study included patients (n = 212) with multiple sclerosis 
      (MS; n = 418 eyes), 59 healthy controls (HCs; n = 117 eyes), and 267 non-MS disease 
      controls (534 eyes). OCT and diffusion tensor imaging were used. RESULTS: There were 
      no PHOMS in HC eyes (0/117, 0%). The prevalence of PHOMS was significantly higher in 
      patients with MS (34/212, p = 0.001) and MS eyes (45/418, p = 0.0002) when compared 
      to HCs (0/59, 0/117). The inter-rater agreement for PHOMS was 97.9% (kappa = 0.951). 
      PHOMS were present in 16% of patients with relapsing-remitting, 16% of patients with 
      progressive, and 12% of patients with secondary progressive disease course (2% of 
      eyes). There was no relationship of PHOMS with age, disease duration, disease 
      course, disability, or disease-modifying treatments. The fractional anisotropy of 
      the optic radiations was lower in patients without PHOMS (0.814) when compared to 
      patients with PHOMS (0.845, p = 0.03). The majority of PHOMS remained stable, but 
      increase in size and de novo development of PHOMS were also observed. In non-MS 
      disease controls, PHOMS were observed in intracranial hypertension (62%), optic disc 
      drusen (47%), anomalous optic discs (44%), isolated optic neuritis (19%), and optic 
      atrophy (12%). INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that PHOMS are a novel finding in 
      MS pathology. Future research is needed to determine whether development of PHOMS in 
      MS is due to intermittently raised intracranial pressure or an otherwise impaired 
      "glymphatic" outflow from eye to brain. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:309-319.

TI  - Evaluation of Brachial Plexus Using Combined Stereological Techniques of Diffusion

PG  - e16-e23
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-1687913 [doi]
AB  - Background  Brachial plexus (BP) is composed of intercommunications among the 
      ventral roots of the nerves C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 in the neck. The in vivo and in 
      vitro evaluation of axons of the peripheral nervous system is performed using 
      different techniques. Recently, many studies describing the application of fiber 
      tractography and stereological axon number estimation to peripheral nerves have been 
      published. Methods  Various quantitative parameters of nerve fibers, including axon 
      number, density, axonal area, and myelin thickness, can be estimated using 
      stereological techniques. In vivo three-dimensional reconstruction of axons of BP 
      can be visualized using a combined technique of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 
      fiber tracking with the potential to evaluate nerve fiber content. Conclusion  It is 
      concluded that terminal branches of BP can be successfully visualized using DTI, 
      which is a highly reproducible method for the evaluation of BP as it shows 
      anatomical and functional features of neural structures. We believe that 
      quantitative morphological findings obtained from BP will be useful for new 
      experimental, developmental, and pathological studies in the future.

TI  - Cerebral Perfusion and Gray Matter Changes Associated With Chemotherapy-Induced 
      Peripheral Neuropathy.
PG  - 677-83
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2015.62.1276 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the longitudinal relationship between chemotherapy-induced 
      peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms (sx) and brain perfusion changes in patients 
      with breast cancer. Interaction of CIPN-sx perfusion effects with known 
      chemotherapy-associated gray matter density decrease was also assessed to elucidate 
      the relationship between CIPN and previously reported cancer treatment-related brain 
      structural changes. METHODS: Patients with breast cancer treated with (n = 24) or 
      without (n = 23) chemotherapy underwent clinical examination and brain magnetic 
      resonance imaging at the following three time points: before treatment (baseline), 1 
      month after treatment completion, and 1 year after the 1-month assessment. CIPN-sx 
      were evaluated with the self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer 
      Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity four-item sensory-specific scale. 
      Perfusion and gray matter density were assessed using voxel-based pulsed arterial 
      spin labeling and morphometric analyses and tested for association with CIPN-sx in 
      the patients who received chemotherapy. RESULTS: Patients who received chemotherapy 
      reported significantly increased CIPN-sx from baseline to 1 month, with partial 
      recovery by 1 year (P < .001). CIPN-sx increase from baseline to 1 month was 
      significantly greater for patients who received chemotherapy compared with those who 
      did not (P = .001). At 1 month, neuroimaging showed that for the group that received 
      chemotherapy, CIPN-sx were positively associated with cerebral perfusion in the 
      right superior frontal gyrus and cingulate gyrus, regions associated with pain 
      processing (P < .001). Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging analysis in the group 
      receiving chemotherapy indicated that CIPN-sx and associated perfusion changes from 
      baseline to 1 month were also positively correlated with gray matter density change 
      (P < .005). CONCLUSION: Peripheral neuropathy symptoms after systemic chemotherapy 
      for breast cancer are associated with changes in cerebral perfusion and gray matter. 
      The specific mechanisms warrant further investigation given the potential diagnostic 
      and therapeutic implications.

TI  - Diffusion-direction-dependent imaging: a novel MRI approach for peripheral nerve 
      imaging.
PG  - 406-11
AB  - A novel magnetic resonance imaging approach, called diffusion-direction-dependent 
      imaging (DDI), is introduced. Due to inherent anisotropic diffusion properties, 
      peripheral nerves can be visualized on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The largest 
      signal attenuation on DTI correlates with the direction of a nerve fiber, and the 
      least signal attenuation correlates with the direction perpendicular to the nerve 
      fiber. Since low signal-to-noise ratio is a concern in peripheral nerve DTI, we 
      explored a new approach focusing on the perpendicular diffusion direction. A 
      36-gradient diffusion direction scheme was used. A mean expected curve specific for 
      peripheral nerves was calculated based on the sciatic nerve and its division into 
      the common peroneal nerve and the tibial nerve in three healthy volunteers. By a 
      simple postprocessing method, a comparison of the mean expected curve and the 
      measured curve was made voxel by voxel, and the sciatic nerve and its division were 
      reconstructed, excluding other tissues. More studies are needed to investigate 
      whether other postprocessing methods or other diffusion direction schemes are more 
      suited for peripheral nerve imaging with DDI. Further studies may also be of 
      interest to investigate whether DDI can be a complementary method to conventional 
      T(1)-weighted and T(2)-weighted sequences in the imaging of peripheral nerve 
      pathology or even in the visualization of other tissues, possibly with different 
      diffusion direction schemes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Differentiating multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) from amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) is important, as MMN is a difficult, but treatable disorder. 
      METHODS: We studied peripheral nerve imaging techniques in differentiating MMN from 
      ALS by measuring the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median and ulnar nerves in 
      the forearms using high resolution ultrasound (HRUS) and MRI. RESULTS: HRUS CSA 
      values of the median nerve in the forearm (P = 0.002) and the ulnar nerve distal to 
      the sulcus (P = 0.009) were significantly enlarged in patients with MMN. There was a 
      positive correlation between CSA as measured with HRUS and MRI (Spearman rho 0.60; 
      P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral nerve imaging is a potentially powerful 
      technique to distinguish MMN from ALS. Muscle Nerve, 2016 Muscle Nerve 54:

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of peripheral nerve in patients with chronic inflammatory 
      demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy: a feasibility study.
PG  - 955-60

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical feasibility of 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the evaluation of peripheral nerves in patients 
      with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). METHODS: 
      Using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, we obtained DTI scans of the tibial 
      nerves of 10 CIDP patients and 10 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. We 
      prepared fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, measured the FA values of tibial nerves, 
      and compared these values in the two study groups. In nine patients, we also 
      performed tibial nerve conduction studies and analyzed the correlation between the 
      FA values and parameters of the nerve conduction study. RESULTS: The tibial nerve FA 
      values in CIDP patients (median 0.401, range 0.312-0.510) were significantly lower 
      than those in healthy volunteers (median 0.530, range 0.469-0.647) (Mann-Whitney 
      test, p < 0.01). They were significantly correlated with the amplitude of action 
      potential (Spearman correlation coefficient, p = 0.04, r = 0.86) but not with nerve 
      conduction velocity (p = 0.79, r = 0.11). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest 
      that the noninvasive DTI assessment of peripheral nerves may provide useful 
      information in patients with CIDP.

TI  - Peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI): normal values and demographic 
      determinants in a cohort of 60 healthy individuals.
PG  - 1801-1808
LID - 10.1007/s00330-017-5134-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic determinants of peripheral nerve diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) and to establish normal values for fractional anisotropy (FA), axial 
      diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD). METHODS: Sixty 
      subjects were examined at 3 Tesla by single-shot DTI. FA, AD, RD, and MD were 
      collected for the sciatic, tibial, median, ulnar, and radial nerve and were 
      correlated with demographic variables. RESULTS: Mean FA of all nerves declined with 
      increasing age (r = -0.77), which could be explained by RD increasing (r = 0.56) and 
      AD declining (r = -0.40) with age. Moreover, FA was inversely associated with height 
      (r = -0.28), weight (r = -0.38) and BMI (r = -0.35). Although FA tended to be lower 
      in men than women (p = 0.052), this difference became completely negligible after 
      adjustment to body weight. A multiple linear regression model for FA was calculated 
      with age and weight as predictors (defined by backward variable selection), yielding 
      an R (2) = 0.71 and providing a correction formula to adjust FA for age and weight. 
      CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve DTI parameters depend on demographic variables. The 
      most important determinants age and weight should be considered in all studies 
      employing peripheral nerve DTI. KEY POINTS: • Peripheral nerve diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) parameters depend on demographic variables. • Fractional anisotropy 
      (FA) declines with increasing age and weight. • Gender does not systematically 
      affect peripheral nerve DTI. • The formula presented here allows adjustment of FA 
      for demographic variables.

AB  - 7.0 Tesla (T) high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can supply information 
      on changing microstructures in cranial nerves. We investigated DTI parameters and 
      the feasibility of DTI criteria for diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia (TN). In this 
      study, 14 patients (28 hemispheres) of mean age 49.0 years (range, 31-64) with TN 
      underwent DTI using 7.0 TMRI. We compared fractional anisotropy (FA), axial 
      diffusivity (AD), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) of 
      affected-side and unaffected-side trigeminal nerves using DTI. We examined 
      associations between DTI parameters and clinical characteristics for patients with 
      TN. In patients with TN, affected sides showed significantly decreased FA and 
      significantly increased MD, and RD compared with unaffected sides of trigeminal 
      nerves. Nuclei were not significantly different among patients with TN. Barrow 
      Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scores did not correlate with affected sides. 
      7.0 T DTI was useful for detecting neurovascular compression in patients with TN. 
      The increased signal-to-noise ratio provided by 7 T MRI should be advantageous for 
      increasing spatial resolution to detect microstructure changes to trigeminal nerves 
      in patients with TN.

      tunnel syndrome.
PG  - 1310-9
LID - 10.1007/s00330-012-2381-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To use pre- and post-operative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to monitor 
      median nerve integrity in patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). 
      METHODS: Diffusivity and anisotropy images along the median nerve were compared 
      among 12 patients, 12 age-matched and 12 young control subjects and correlated with 
      electrophysiological neurography results. Slice-wise DTI parameter values were 
      calculated to focus on local changes. RESULTS: Results of pre-operative patients and 
      age-matched control subjects differed only in the distal nerve. Moreover, 
      pre-operative patients differed significantly from young controls and post-operative 
      patients. The main abnormalities were increased diffusivity and decreased anisotropy 
      in the carpal tunnel and distal median nerve. Post-operative clinical improvement 
      was reflected in diffusivity, but not in anisotropy. Slice-wise analysis showed high 
      pre-operative diffusivity at the distal nerve. All groups had relatively large 
      inter-subject variation in both diffusivity and anisotropy. CONCLUSIONS: DTI can 
      provide information complementary to clinical examination, electrophysiological 
      recordings and anatomical MRI of diseases and injuries of peripheral nerves. 
      However, similar age-related changes in diffusivity and anisotropy may weaken DTI 
      specificity. Slice-wise analysis is necessary for detection of local changes in 
      nerve integrity. KEY POINTS: • Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging provides 
      information complementary to conventional diagnostic methods. • Age caused similar 
      changes to diffusivity and anisotropy as carpal tunnel syndrome. • Post-operative 
      clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but not in anisotropy. • 
      Inter-subject variation in diffusivity and anisotropy was considerable.

TI  - Dorsal root ganglia hypertrophy as in vivo correlate of oxaliplatin-induced

PG  - e0183845
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0183845 [doi]
LID - e0183845
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate in vivo morphological and functional correlates of 
      oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXA-PNP) by magnetic resonance 
      neurography (MRN). METHODS: Twenty patients (7 female, 13 male, 58.9±10.0 years) 
      with mild to moderate OXA-PNP and 20 matched controls (8 female, 12 male, 55.7±15.6 
      years) were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent a detailed 
      neurophysiological examination prior to neuroimaging. A standardized imaging 
      protocol at 3.0 Tesla included the lumbosacral plexus and both sciatic nerves and 
      their branches using T2-weighted fat-saturated sequences and diffusion tensor 
      imaging. Quantitative assessment included volumetry of the dorsal root ganglia 
      (DRG), sciatic nerve normalized T2 (nT2) signal and caliber, and fractional 
      anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). 
      Additional qualitative evaluation of sciatic, peroneal, and tibial nerves evaluated 
      the presence, degree, and distribution of nerve lesions. RESULTS: DRG hypertrophy in 
      OXA-PNP patients (207.3±47.7mm3 vs. 153.0±47.1mm3 in controls, p = 0.001) was found 
      as significant morphological correlate of the sensory neuronopathy. In contrast, 
      peripheral nerves only exhibited minor morphological alterations qualitatively. 
      Quantitatively, sciatic nerve caliber (27.3±6.7mm2 vs. 27.4±7.4mm2, p = 0.80) and 
      nT2 signal were not significantly changed in patients (1.32±0.22 vs. 1.22±0.26, p = 
      0.16). AD, RD, and MD showed a non-significant decrease in patients, while FA was 
      unchanged. CONCLUSION: OXA-PNP manifests with morphological and functional 
      correlates that can be detected in vivo by MRN. We report hypertrophy of the DRG 
      that stands in contrast to experimental and postmortem studies. DRG volume should be 
      further investigated as a biomarker in other sensory peripheral neuropathies and 
      ganglionopathies.

TI  - Utility of MRI Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 736-42
AB  - BACKGROUND After successful utilization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 
      detecting brain pathologies, it is now being examined for use in the detection of 
      peripheral neuropathies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the 
      diagnostic potentials of DTI in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). MATERIAL AND METHODS 
      The literature search was performed in multiple electronic databases using a keyword 
      search and final selection of the studies was based on predetermined inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria. We performed a meta-analyses of mean differences in fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between CTS patient and 
      healthy subjects. Publication bias detection was done with Begg's test and 
      sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the source/s of higher heterogeneity 
      and the authenticity of results. RESULTS FA was significantly lower in CTS patients 
      in comparison with healthy subjects (mean and the difference [95% confidence 
      interval] was -0.06 [-0.10, -0.02] (p=0.003). The ADC was significantly higher in 
      CTS patients (mean difference [95% CI] was 0.10 [0.02, 0.18], p=0.02). Overall 
      sensitivity of FA-based diagnosis was 82.82%, with 77.83% specificity. CONCLUSIONS 
      DTI can be a valuable tool in diagnosing CTS.

TI  - Anatomical and functional correlates of persistent pain in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1854-1864
LID - 10.1002/mds.26826 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of pain in Parkinson's disease (PD) is still poorly 
      understood, although it is conceivable that supraspinal mechanisms may be 
      responsible for pain generation and maintenance. METHODS: We examined brain 
      functional and anatomical changes associated with persistent pain in 40 PD patients, 
      20 with persistent pain and 20 without pain. We also examined 15 pain-free healthy 
      participants of similar age, gender, and cognitive state as a control group. We 
      assessed pain by the King's Parkinson's Pain Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale for 
      pain, and the Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Symptoms and Sign. All patients 
      underwent structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting-state functional MRI. We 
      compared clinical characteristics, whole-brain cortical thickness, subcortical 
      volumes, diffusion tensor imaging scalar measures, and functional connectivity by 
      network based statistics. RESULTS: The group with PD and persistent pain showed 
      significant thinning in the bilateral temporal pole, left-medial orbitofrontal 
      cortex, bilateral superior and left-inferior parietal areas, pars orbicularis, and 
      right superior frontal, posterior cingulated, and precentral cortex. There were no 
      significant subcortical volume and white matter differences between PD subgroups. 
      Functional MRI showed a decrease of brain activity in the left frontal inferior 
      orbital in PD patients with persistent pain, with greater activity bilaterally in 
      the cerebellum and in the right inferior temporal areas. Only PD patients with 
      persistent pain showed an accumbens-hippocampus disconnection without white matter 
      and subcortical alterations. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that persistent pain in PD is 
      associated with supraspinal structural and functional changes. We also highlighted 
      the contribution of frontal, prefrontal, and insular areas in nociceptive modulation 
      and accumbens-hippocampus disconnection. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement

TI  - Multi-System Factors Associated with Metatarsophalangeal Joint Deformity in 
      Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9041012 [doi]
LID - 1012
AB  - The underlying factors contributing to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity, a known 
      precursor to skin breakdown in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM), is likely to 
      involve multiple body systems. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to 
      identify multi-system factors associated with metatarsophalangeal joint deformity in 
      individuals with type 2 DM and peripheral neuropathy (n = 60). Metatarsophalangeal 
      joint deformity was quantified with a computed tomography (CT) scan. System 
      biomarkers included the musculoskeletal system (foot intrinsic muscle deterioration, 
      tarsal/metatarsal bone mineral density, ankle dorsiflexion, metatarsophalangeal 
      extension movement during a sit to stand task); the vascular system (ankle-brachial 
      index); and the endocrine/immune systems (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, skin 
      intrinsic fluorescence, and hemoglobin A1C). Muscle deterioration (r = 0.27), bone 
      density (r = -0.35), metatarsophalangeal extension movement (r = 0.50), maximum 
      dorsiflexion (r = -0.31), and ankle-brachial index (r = 0.33) were related to 
      metatarsophalangeal joint deformity (p < 0.05). Bone mineral density and 
      metatarsophalangeal extension movement were retained in a regression model relating 
      to deformity (R(2) = 0.34). All musculoskeletal system biomarkers and the 
      ankle-brachial index demonstrated weak to moderate relationships to 
      metatarsophalangeal joint deformity. Bone mineral density of the tarsal/metatarsal 
      bones and extending the toes during a sit to stand task were the two strongest 
      factors associated with metatarsophalangeal joint deformity. Evaluation and 
      management of foot bone mineral density and toe extension movement pattern could 
      reduce metatarsophalangeal joint deformity and the risk of skin breakdown and 
      subsequent amputation.

AB  - We examined if MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking could be performed on 
      the sciatic nerve. In 3 healthy volunteers the proximal thigh was examined on a 
      1.5-Tesla MR-scanner with a 2-channel phased-array coil. Though inherently 
      susceptible to motion, field inhomogeneities, and fast T(2)-relaxation of the 
      diffusion imaging technique, the sciatic nerve could be detected and correlated to 
      T(2)-weighted images in all 3 subjects. Further investigations need to be done to 
      improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to see if smaller peripheral nerves than the 
      sciatic nerve can be detected.

TI  - Visualization of peripheral nerve degeneration and regeneration: monitoring with 
      diffusion tensor tractography.
PG  - 884-92
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.09.022 [doi]
AB  - We applied diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), a recently developed MRI technique 
      that reveals the microstructures of tissues based on its ability to monitor the 
      random movements of water molecules, to the visualization of peripheral nerves after 
      injury. The rat sciatic nerve was subjected to contusive injury, and the data 
      obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to determine the tracks of 
      nerve fibers (DTT). The DTT images obtained using the fractional anisotropy (FA) 
      threshold value of 0.4 clearly revealed the recovery process of the contused nerves. 
      Immediately after the injury, fiber tracking from the designated proximal site could 
      not be continued beyond the lesion epicenter, but the intensity improved thereafter, 
      returning to its pre-injury level by 3 weeks later. We compared the FA value, a 
      parameter computed from the DTT data, with the results of histological and 
      functional examinations of the injured nerves, during recovery. The FA values of the 
      peripheral nerves were more strongly correlated with axon-related (axon density and 
      diameter) than with myelin-related (myelin density and thickness) parameters, 
      supporting the theories that axonal membranes play a major role in anisotropic water 
      diffusion and that myelination can modulate the degree of anisotropy. Moreover, 
      restoration of the FA value at the lesion epicenter was strongly correlated with 
      parameters of motor and sensory functional recovery. These correlations of the FA 
      values with both the histological and functional changes demonstrate the potential 
      usefulness of DTT for evaluating clinical events associated with Wallerian 
      degeneration and the regeneration of peripheral nerves.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess diffusion tensor imaging in the diagnosis of 
      mild-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and to correlate fractional anisotropy 
      (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with nerve conduction study and 
      clinical tests. This prospective study was conducted upon 39 patients (9 males, 30 
      females; mean age = 33 years) with early stage of CTS. Twenty age- and sex-matched 
      healthy volunteers were included as a control group. All patients underwent clinical 
      tests and nerve conduction studies with calculation of the distal motor latency 
      (DML) and distal sensory latency (DSL). Patients with CTS and volunteers underwent 
      diffusion tensor imaging of the median nerve. The cross-sectional area (CSA), FA, 
      and ADC of the median nerve were calculated. There was significant difference in FA 
      and ADC between patients and controls (P = 0.001 respectively) and between mild and 
      moderate CTS (P = 0.001 respectively). The cutoff FA and ADC of the median nerve 
      used for the diagnosis of CTS were 0.45 and 1.31 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s with areas under 
      the curve (AUC) of 0.985 and 0.954, respectively, and the values used to 
      differentiate mild from moderate CTS were 0.42 and 1.35 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s with AUC of 
      0.964 and 0.688, respectively. The FA and ADC of the median nerve were correlated 
      with CSA (r = 0.894; -0.769), DML (r = -0.935; 0.781), DSL (r = -0.953; 0.781), 
      Tinel's test (r = 0.742; 0.684), and Phalen's test (r = 0.862; 0.742). Diffusion 
      tensor imaging can be used for the diagnosis of mild-moderate CTS and well 
      correlated with nerve conduction studies and clinical tests.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sacral nerve root features by the means of magnetic 
      resonance imaging-diffusion tensor imaging (MRI-DTI) tractography in women with 
      endometriosis and/or adenomyosis, and to analyze the correlations among DTI 
      abnormalities, pain symptoms, and endometriotic lesions found at surgery. DESIGN: A 
      cross-sectional, observational study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). 
      SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Women (n = 76) with clinical suspicion of 
      endometriosis. INTERVENTIONS: Before surgery, dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, and 
      noncyclic pelvic pain (NCPP) were assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale. MRI 
      enabled a 3-dimensional reconstruction of S1, S2, and S3. Fractional anisotropy was 
      calculated for each root. Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis was performed in 
      56 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our findings revealed correlations among 
      sacral root reconstruction by MRI-DTI, pain symptoms, and laparoscopic findings. DTI 
      of sacral roots revealed a regular and homogeneous appearance in 17 patients (25.8%) 
      and abnormalities in microstructure reconstruction, with fiber irregularities and 
      disorganization and loss of the simple unidirectional course, in 44 patients 
      (66.7%). At laparoscopy, ovarian endometriomas were found in 82.1% of the patients, 
      and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) were found in 57.1%. Endometriosis was 
      staged according to the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine 
      classification. Pathological DTI findings were significantly associated with the 
      severity of dysmenorrhea and NCPP, pain duration, presence of tubo-ovarian and 
      cul-de-sac adhesions, and DIE. CONCLUSION: The presence of pathological DTI findings 
      of the sacral nerve roots correlates with the type of pain, adhesions, and DIE. At 
      present, DTI can be useful for providing a better understanding of pain; however, 
      DTI could become a useful tool in therapeutic planning for patients with 
      endometriosis.

AB  - Background Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of peripheral nerves may provide 
      additional information about nerve involvement in muscular disorders, but is 
      considered difficult due to different optimal scan parameters tailored to magnetic 
      resonance (MR) signal properties of muscle and neural tissues. Purpose To assess the 
      feasibility of sciatic nerve DTI using two different approaches of region of 
      interest (ROI)-localization in DTI scans with b-values 500 s/mm(2), in participants 
      with muscular disorders and in controls. Material and Methods DTI of the thigh was 
      conducted on a 3T system in ten patients (6 men, 4 women; mean age =54 ± 15 years) 
      with neuromuscular disorders and ten controls. T1-weighted (T1W) images were 
      co-registered to fractional anisotropy (FA) color-encoded images. The apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, and fiber track length (FTL) were analyzed by two 
      operators using a freehand ROI and a single-point ROI covering the sciatic nerve. 
      Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis were used for 
      evaluation of inter-operator and inter-technical agreement, respectively. Results 
      Three-dimensional visualization of sciatic nerve fiber was achievable using both 
      techniques. The ICC of DTI metrics showed excellent inter-operator agreement both in 
      patients and controls. Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement of both 
      techniques. A maximum FTL was achieved using the single-point ROI technique, but 
      with a lower inter-operator agreement (ICC = 0.99 vs. 0.83). The ADC and maximum FTL 
      were significantly decreased in patients compared to controls. Conclusion Both ROI 
      localization techniques are feasible to analyze the sciatic nerve in the setting of 
      muscular disease. A maximum FTL is reached using the single-point ROI, however, at 
      the cost of lower inter-operator agreement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To delineate fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) values of compressed nerve roots in patients with lumbar disc 
      herniation by diffusion tensor imaging and fiber bundle tracing and investigate the 
      relationship between FA and ADC values and Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and 
      visual analog scale scores. METHODS: Twenty patients with lumbar disc herniation and 
      20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were assessed using the Swiss Spinal 
      Stenosis Questionnaire and visual analog scale. All subjects underwent conventional 
      sagittal T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, axial T2-weighted 
      imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tractography. RESULTS: In 20 
      patients with lumbar disc herniation, there were 31 nerve roots involved (9/31 L4, 
      15/31 L5, and 7/31 S1). Mean Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire scores of patients 
      were 53.55% ± 11.91%, and mean visual analog scale scores were 5.96 ± 1.64. FA 
      values of lumbar nerve roots were 0.332 ± 0.014 in healthy volunteers. FA values of 
      compressed lumbar nerve roots were 0.251 ± 0.022, significantly lower than FA values 
      of contralateral noncompressed nerve roots and lumbar nerve roots of healthy 
      volunteers. ADC values of lumbar nerve roots were 1.763 ± 0.075 in healthy 
      volunteers. ADC values of compressed lumbar nerve roots were 2.090 ± 0.078, 
      significantly higher than ADC values of contralateral noncompressed nerve roots and 
      lumbar nerve roots of healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Fiber tractography is capable 
      of delineating microstructural changes of lumbosacral nerve roots, and radiculopathy 
      in lumbar disc herniation is associated with significant changes in FA and ADC 
      values.

AB  - PURPOSE: Imaging criteria for diagnosing compressive ulnar neuropathy at the elbow 
      (UNE) have recently been established as the maximum ulnar nerve cross-sectional area 
      (UNCSA) upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or ultrasonography (US). However, 
      the levels of maximum UNCSA and diagnostic cutoff values have not yet been 
      established. We therefore analyzed UNCSA by MRI and US in patients with UNE and in 
      controls. METHODS: We measured UNCSA at 7 levels in 30 patients with UNE and 28 
      controls by MRI and at 15 levels in 12 patients with UNE and 24 controls by US. We 
      compared UNCSA as determined by MRI or US and determined optimal diagnostic cutoff 
      values based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: The UNCSA 
      was significantly larger in the UNE group than in controls at 3, 2, 1, and 0 cm 
      proximal and 1, 2, and 3 cm distal to the medial epicondyle for both modalities. The 
      UNCSA was maximal at 1 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle for MRI (16.1 ± 3.5 
      mm(2)) as well as for US (17 ± 7 mm(2)). A cutoff value of 11.0 mm(2) for MRI and US 
      was found to be optimal for differentiating between patients with UNE and controls, 
      with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 for MRI and 
      0.96 for US. The UNCSA measured by MRI was not significantly different from that by 
      US. Intra-rater and interrater reliabilities for UNCSA were all greater than 0.77. 
      The UNCSA in the severe nerve dysfunction group of 18 patients was significantly 
      larger than that in the mild nerve dysfunction group of 12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: By 
      measuring UNCSA with MRI or US at 1 cm proximal to the ME, patients with and without 
      UNE could be discriminated at a cutoff threshold of 11.0 mm(2) with high 
      sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Diagnostic III.

TI  - The future of magnetic resonance-based techniques in neurology.
PG  - 17-25
AB  - Magnetic resonance techniques have become increasingly important in neurology for 
      defining: 1. brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerve or muscle structure; 2. 
      pathological changes in tissue structures and properties; and 3. dynamic patterns of 
      functional activation of the brain. New applications have been driven in part by 
      advances in hardware, particularly improvements in magnet and gradient coil design. 
      New imaging strategies allow novel approaches to contrast with, for example, 
      diffusion imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, perfusion imaging and functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging. In parallel with developments in hardware and image 
      acquisition have been new approaches to image analysis. These have allowed 
      quantitative descriptions of the image changes to be used for a precise, 
      non-invasive definition of pathology. With the increasing capabilities and 
      specificity of magnetic resonance techniques it is becoming more important that the 
      neurologist is intimately involved in both the selection of magnetic resonance 
      studies for patients and their interpretation. There is a need for considerably 
      improved access to magnetic resonance technology, particularly in the acute or 
      intensive care ward and in the neurosurgical theatre. This report illustrates 
      several key developments. The task force concludes that magnetic resonance imaging 
      is a major clinical tool of growing significance and offers recommendations for 
      maximizing the potential future for magnetic resonance techniques in neurology.

TI  - Visualization of nerve fibers around the carotid bifurcation with use of a 9.4 Tesla 
      microscopic magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging with tractography.
PG  - 2228-2234
LID - 10.1002/hed.25318 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Precise imaging of nerves have been challenging in the head and neck 
      region, mainly due to low spatial resolution. Here, we investigated how nerves in 
      the head and neck region could be visualized using an ultra-high magnetic field MR 
      system. METHODS: We used formol-carbol-fixed human cadaveric necks and obtained MR 
      diffusion tensor images (DTIs) using a 9.4 Tesla (T) ultra-high magnetic field MR 
      system. Afterward, we prepared tissue sections and checked the anatomic 
      relationships between the neurons and the carotid artery in order to confirm that 
      the visualized fibers are indeed neuron fibers. RESULTS: We were able to identify 
      nerves, including the vagus nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, and the spinal-accessory 
      nerve. Hematoxylin-eosin stained histological sections confirmed neuron fibers in 
      the same anatomic position. CONCLUSION: This technique has the feasibility to be 
      applied for a more accurate anatomic understanding, maybe even close to a 
      histological level.

TI  - Magnetic Resonance Neurography Visualizes Abnormalities in Sciatic and Tibial Nerves 
      in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes and Neuropathy.
PG  - 1779-1788
LID - 10.2337/db16-1049 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluates whether diffusion tensor imaging magnetic resonance neurography 
      (DTI-MRN), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density can detect and grade 
      neuropathic abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetes. Patients with type 1 
      diabetes (n = 49) were included-11 with severe polyneuropathy (sDPN), 13 with mild 
      polyneuropathy (mDPN), and 25 without polyneuropathy (nDPN)-along with 30 healthy 
      control subjects (HCs). Clinical examinations, nerve conduction studies, and 
      vibratory perception thresholds determined the presence and severity of DPN. DTI-MRN 
      covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal (tibial nerve) nerve segments of the 
      lower extremity. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient 
      (ADC) were calculated, as were T2 relaxation time and proton spin density obtained 
      from DTI-MRN. All magnetic resonance findings were related to the presence and 
      severity of neuropathy. FA of the sciatic and tibial nerves was lowest in the sDPN 
      group. Corresponding with this, proximal and distal ADCs were highest in patients 
      with sDPN compared with patients with mDPN and nDPN, as well as the HCs. DTI-MRN 
      correlated closely with the severity of neuropathy, demonstrating strong 
      associations with sciatic and tibial nerve findings. Quantitative group differences 
      in proton spin density were also significant, but less pronounced than those for 
      DTI-MRN. In conclusion, DTI-MRN enables detection in peripheral nerves of 
      abnormalities related to DPN, more so than proton spin density or T2 relaxation 
      time. These abnormalities are likely to reflect pathology in sciatic and tibial 
      nerve fibers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to clarify the normal fractional anisotropy (FA) and 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the sciatic and femoral nerves at the 
      level of the hip joint and to visualize the neural tracts with diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI). METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 men and 12 women, age 
      20-29 years) underwent DTI for visualization with tractography and quantification of 
      FA and ADC values on a 3 Tesla MRI (b value = 800 s/mm(2), motion probing gradient, 
      11 directions, time to repeat/echo time = 9000/72.6 ms, axial slice orientation, 
      slice thickness = 3.0 mm with no inter-slice gap, field of view = 320 × 320 mm, 
      96 × 192 matrix, 75 slices, number of acquisitions = 4). Regions of interest in the 
      sciatic nerve were defined at the femoral head, the S1 root, and the midpoint 
      levels. The femoral nerve was evaluated at 3-4 cm proximal to the femoral head 
      level. RESULTS: The tractography of the sciatic and femoral nerves were visualized 
      in all participants. The mean FA values of the sciatic nerve were increased distally 
      from the S1 root level, through the midpoint, and to the femoral head level (0.314, 
      0.446, 0.567, p = 0.001, respectively). The mean FA values of the femoral nerve were 
      0.565. The mean ADC values of the sciatic nerves were significantly lower in the S1 
      root level than in the midpoint and the femoral head level (1.481, 1.602, 
      1.591 × 10(-3) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, p = 0.001, respectively). The ADC values of the 
      femoral nerve were 1.439 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s. FA and ADC values showed moderate to 
      substantial inter- and intra-observer reliability without significant differences in 
      gender or laterality. CONCLUSION: Visualization and quantification of the sciatic 
      and femoral nerves simultaneously around the hip joint were achieved in healthy 
      young volunteers with DTI. Clinical application of DTI is expected to contribute to 
      hip pain research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 
      quantitatively monitoring chronic constriction injuri (CCI) of sciatic nerves and to 
      analyse the association of DTI parameters with nerve histology and limb function. 
      METHODS: CCI was created on sciatic nerves in the right hind legs of 20 rabbits with 
      the left as control. DTI parameters-fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD)-and limb 
      function were longitudinally evaluated. Pathology analysis was performed on day 3 
      (d3), week 1 (w1), 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. RESULTS: FA of the constricted nerves 
      decreased on d3 (0.316 ± 0.044) and increased from w1 to w10 (0.331 ± 0.018, 0.354 ± 
      0.044, 0.375 ± 0.015, 0.394 ± 0.020, 0.42 ± 0.03 and 0.464 ± 0.039). ADC increased 
      on d3 until w2 (1.502 ± 0.126, 1.462 ± 0.058 and 1.473 ± 0.124 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1)) 
      and decreased to normal from w4 to w10 (1.356 ± 0.129, 1.375 ± 0.107, 1.290 ± 0.064 
      and 1.298 ± 0.026 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1)). AD decreased and stayed low from d3 to w10 
      (2.042 ± 0.160, 2.005 ± 0.095, 2.057 ± 0.124, 1.952 ± 0.213, 1.988 ± 0.180, 1.947 ± 
      0.106 and 2.097 ± 0.114). RD increased on d3 (1.233 ± 0.152) and declined from w1 to 
      w10 (1.19 ± 0.06, 1.181 ± 0.14, 1.071 ± 0.102, 1.068 ± 0.084, 0.961 ± 0.063 and 
      0.923 ± 0.058). FA, ADC and RD correlated significantly with limb functional scores 
      (all Ps < 0.0001) and their changes were associated with histological changes. 
      CONCLUSION: FA, ADC and RD are promising to monitor CCI. AD may be a stable 
      indicator for injury. Histological changes, oedema, axon loss and demyelination, and 
      fibrosis, accompanied the changes of these parameters. Advances in knowledge: DTI 
      parameters can detect and monitor acute and chronic changes after nerve compression.

TI  - US and MR imaging of peripheral nerves in leprosy.
PG  - 142-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze peripheral nerves with ultrasonography (US) and magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MR) in leprosy and assess the role of imaging in leprosy 
      patients. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Fifty-eight nerves with abnormal clinical features or 
      electromyograms were examined in 23 leprosy patients by means of gray-scale US, 
      Doppler US and MR imaging. Image analysis included: measurement of nerve 
      cross-sectional area; assessment of nerve structure and MR signal intensities; 
      identification of nerve compression within osteofibrous tunnels; detection of 
      endoneural color flow signals and Gd-DTPA enhancement. Correlations were made with 
      clinical findings and a control group of 20 subjects. Fourteen nerves in active 
      reversal reaction were followed up after therapy. RESULTS: Leprosy nerves were 
      classified into three groups based on imaging appearance: group I consisted of 17 
      normal-appearing nerves; group II, of 30 enlarged nerves with fascicular 
      abnormalities; group III, of 11 nerves with absent fascicular structure. Group II 
      nerves were from patients subjected to reversal reactions; 75% of patients with 
      group III nerves had a history of erythema nodosum leprosum. Nerve compression in 
      osteofibrous tunnels was identified in 33% of group II and 18% of group III nerves. 
      Doppler US and MR imaging were 74% and 92% sensitive in identifying active 
      reactions, based on detection of endoneural color flow signals, long T2 and Gd 
      enhancement. In 64% of cases, follow-up studies showed decreased color flow and Gd 
      uptake after steroids and decompressive surgery. CONCLUSIONS: US and MR imaging are 
      able to detect nerves abnormalities in leprosy. Active reversal reactions are 
      indicated by endoneural color flow signals as well as by an increased T2 signal and 
      Gd enhancement. These signs would suggest rapid progression of nerve damage and a 
      poor prognosis unless antireactional treatment is started.

TI  - Look for the nerves! MR neurography adds essential diagnostic value to routine MRI 
      in pediatric practice: a pictorial overview.
PG  - 141-7
LID - 10.1016/j.neurad.2010.09.006 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) 
      neurography in children, and the potential roles of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) 
      and fiber-tracking (FT) techniques. METHODS: Five pediatric patients (age range: 
      6-12 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for various clinical 
      indications: neurogenic bladder (case 1); persistent hand pain following minor 
      trauma (case 2); progressive atrophy of the lower left extremity muscles (case 3); 
      bilateral hip pain (case 4); and palpable left supraclavicular mass (case 5). All 
      studies were performed using a 1.5-T Avanto MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, 
      Germany). The protocol included 3D T2-weighted STIR and SPACE imaging, T1-weighted 
      fat-saturation post-gadolinium imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with 
      tractography. ADC (N×10(-3) mm(2)/s) and FA values were calculated from regions of 
      interest (ROIs) centered on the nerves. Nerve-fiber tracks were calculated using a 
      fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (NeuroD software). RESULTS: MR neurography 
      allowed satisfactory visualization of all neural structures, and FA and ADC 
      measurements were feasible. The final diagnoses were Tarlov cysts, median-nerve 
      compression, sciatic perineurioma, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and plexiform 
      neurofibroma in a patient with NF-1. DISCUSSION: FA and ADC measurements are of 
      little value because of the lack of normal reference values. Nerve-fiber 
      tractography (FT) may be of value in the characterization of tumor pathology, and is 
      also helpful in the planning of surgical treatments. CONCLUSION: MR neurography is 
      feasible in pediatric patients. However, a considerable amount of work has yet to be 
      done to establish its role in the clinical management of the wide range of 
      peripheral nerve diseases.

TI  - Multi-component T1 relaxation and magnetisation transfer in peripheral nerve.
PG  - 1033-41
AB  - We report here a study of longitudinal relaxation (T1) and magnetisation transfer 
      (MT) in peripheral nerve. Amphibian sciatic nerve was maintained in vitro and 
      studied at a magnetic field strength of 3 T. A CPMG pulse sequence was modified to 
      include either a saturation pulse to measure T1 relaxation or an off-resonance RF 
      irradiation pulse to measure MT. The resulting transverse relaxation (T2) spectra 
      yielded four components corresponding to three nerve compartments, taken to result 
      from myelinic, axonal, and inter-axonal water, and a fourth corresponding to the 
      buffer solution water in which the nerve sample was bathed. Each nerve component was 
      analysed for T1 relaxation and MT. All three nerve T2 components exhibited unique T1 
      relaxation and MT characteristics, providing further support for the assignment of 
      the components to unique physical compartments of water. Numerical investigation of 
      T1sat measurements of each of the three nerve T2 components indicates that while the 
      two shorter-lived exhibit similar steady-state magnetisation transfer ratios (MTRs), 
      their respective MT properties are quite different. Simulations demonstrate that 
      mobile water exchange between these two components is not necessary to explain their 
      similar steady-state MTR. In the context of the assignment of these two components 
      to signal from myelinic and axonal water, this is to say that these two 
      microanatomical regions of nerve may exhibit similar steady-state MTR 
      characteristics despite possessing widely different MT exchange rates. Therefore, 
      interpreting changes in MTR solely to reflect a change in degree of myelination 
      could lead to erroneous conclusions.

TI  - Assessment of the synergic effect of immunomodulation on nerve repair using 
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - E38-E45
LID - 10.1002/mus.25674 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The immune system plays a pivotal role in nerve injury. The aim of 
      this study was to determine the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) in evaluation of the synergic effect of immunomodulation on nerve regeneration 
      in neurotmesis. METHODS: Rats with sciatic nerve neurotmesis and surgical repair 
      underwent serial multiparametric MR examinations over an 8-week period after 
      subepineurial microinjection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequent subcutaneous 
      injection of FK506 or subepineurial microinjection of LPS or phosphate-buffered 
      saline (PBS) alone. RESULTS: Nerves treated with immunomodulation showed more 
      prominent regeneration than those treated with LPS or PBS alone and more rapid 
      restoration toward normal T2, fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial diffusivity 
      (RD) values than nerves injected with LPS or PBS. DISCUSSION: Nerves treated with 
      immunomodulation exert synergic beneficial effects on nerve regeneration that can be 
      predicted by T2 measurements and FA and RD values. Muscle Nerve 57: E38-E45, 2018.

TI  - High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the human median nerve.
PG  - 80-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It is widely accepted that peripheral nerve repairs performed within 6 
      weeks of injury have much better outcomes than those performed at later dates. 
      However, there is no diagnostic technique that can determine if a traumatic 
      peripheral nerve injury requires surgical intervention in the early postinjury 
      phase. The objective of this article was to determine whether novel, noninvasive 
      magnetic resonance imaging techniques could demonstrate the microstructure of human 
      peripheral nerves that is necessary for determining prognosis and determining if 
      surgery is indicated following traumatic injury. METHODS: Ex vivo magnetic resonance 
      imaging protocols were developed on a 9.4-T research scanner using spin-echo proton 
      density and gradient-echo imaging sequences and a specially designed, inductively 
      coupled radio frequency coil. These imaging protocols were applied to in situ 
      imaging of the human median nerve in 4 fresh-frozen cadaver arms. RESULTS: 
      Noninvasive high-resolution images of the human median nerve were obtained. 
      Structures in the nerve that were observed included fascicles, interfascicular 
      epineurium, perineurium, and intrafascicular septations. CONCLUSION: Application of 
      these imaging techniques to clinical scanners could provide physicians with a tool 
      that is capable of grading the severity of nerve injuries and providing indications 
      for surgery in the early postinjury phase.

AB  - Here, we report the structural evidence of cerebral white matter abnormalities in 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) patients and the relationship between these abnormalities 
      and clinical disability. Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in CMT 
      patients with demyelinating (CMT1A/CMT1E), axonal (CMT2A/CMT2E), or intermediate 
      (CMTX1/DI-CMT) peripheral neuropathy. Although all patients had normal brain 
      magnetic resonance imaging, all genetic subgroups except CMT1A had abnormal DTI 
      findings indicative of significant cerebral white matter abnormalities: decreased 
      fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity, and increased radial diffusivity. DTI 
      abnormalities were correlated with clinical disability, suggesting that there is 
      comorbidity of central nervous system damage with peripheral neuropathy in CMT 
      patients. ANN NEUROL 2017;81:147-151.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuro-axonal injury is a key contributor to non-reversible long-term 
      disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the underlying mechanisms are not 
      yet fully understood. Visual impairment is common among MS patients, in which 
      episodes of optic neuritis (ON) are often followed by structural retinal damage and 
      sustained functional impairment. Alterations in the optic nerve and retina have also 
      been described in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of 
      MS. Thus, investigating structural anterior visual pathway damage may constitute a 
      unique model for assessing mechanisms and temporal sequence of neurodegeneration in 
      MS. We used a multimodal imaging approach utilizing optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to explore the mechanisms and temporal 
      dynamics of visual pathway damage in the animal model of MS. METHODS: 7 
      EAE-MOG(35-55) and 5 healthy female C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Ganglion 
      cell complex (GCC) thickness was derived from an OCT volume scan centred over the 
      optic nerve head, while the structure of the optic nerve and tracts was assessed 
      from DTI and co-registered T2-weighted sequences performed on a 7T MRI scanner. Data 
      was acquired at baseline, disease onset, peak of disease and recovery. Linear mixed 
      effect models were used to account for intra-subject, inter-eye dependencies, group 
      and time point. Correlation analyses assessed the relationship between GCC thickness 
      and DTI parameters. Immunofluorescence staining of retina and optic nerve sections 
      was used to assess distribution of marker proteins for microglia and 
      neurodegeneration (nerve filaments). RESULTS: In EAE mice, a significant increase in 
      GCC thickness was observed at disease onset (p < 0.001) followed by a decrease at 
      recovery (p < 0.001) compared to controls. The EAE group had significant GCC 
      thinning at recovery compared to all other time points (p < 0.001 for each). Signal 
      increase on T2-weighted images around the optic nerves indicative of inflammation 
      was seen in most of the EAE mice but in none of the controls. A significant decrease 
      in axial diffusivity (AD) and increase in radial diffusivity (RD) values in EAE 
      optic nerves (AD: p = 0.02, RD: p = 0.01) and tract (AD: p = 0.02, RD: p = 0.006) 
      was observed compared to controls. GCC at recovery was positively correlated with AD 
      (optic nerve: rho = 0.74, p = 0.04, optic tract: rho = 0.74, p = 0.04) and 
      negatively correlated with RD (optic nerve: rho = -0.80, p = 0.02, optic tract: 
      rho = -0.75, p = 0.04). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated the presence of 
      activated microglia in the retina and optic nerves in addition to astrocytosis and 
      axonal degeneration in the optic nerve of EAE mice. CONCLUSION: OCT detected GCC 
      changes in EAE may resemble what is observed in MS-related acute ON: an initial 
      phase of swelling (indicative of inflammatory edema) followed by a decrease in 
      thickness over time (representative of neuro-axonal degeneration). In line with OCT 
      findings, DTI of the visual pathway identifies EAE induced pathology (decreased AD, 
      and increased RD). Immunofluorescence analysis provides support for inflammatory 
      pathology and axonal degeneration. OCT together with DTI can detect retinal and 
      optic nerve damage and elucidate to the temporal sequence of neurodegeneration in 
      this rodent model of MS in vivo.

      fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient values relative to the 
      piriformis muscle, a preliminary study.
PG  - 309-314
LID - 10.1007/s00256-016-2557-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Piriformis muscle syndrome (PMS) is underdiagnosed. To evaluate the 
      potential of diffusion tensor imaging and diffusion tensor tractography as 
      innovative tools for the diagnosis of PMS by functional assessment of the sciatic 
      nerve, the aims of this study are to assess the reproducibility and to evaluate the 
      changes in the parameters at levels proximal and distal to the piriformis. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
      of the sciatic nerve at three levels were quantified twice each by two examiners 
      using the fiber-tracking method. In the first part of the study, laterality and 
      reproducibility were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) in 
      ten healthy volunteers. In the second part of the study, the healthy side and 
      symptomatic side were assessed in ten consecutive patients with sciatica. There were 
      three patients with no findings on lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: 
      There was no laterality in either FA or ADC values in asymptomatic patients at any 
      level. The mean intra-rater ICC was 0.90 and the mean inter-rater ICC was 0.87. FA 
      was significantly lower and ADC significantly higher on the symptomatic side at each 
      level in patients with sciatica. In the three sciatica patients with no findings on 
      lumbar MRI, FA was significantly lower and ADC was significantly higher only at 
      levels distal to the piriformis. These patients experienced full pain relief after 
      ultrasound-guided injection of local anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor 
      imaging and diffusion tensor tractography might be innovative tools for the 
      diagnosis of PMS.

TI  - Determination of optimum pixel size and slice thickness for tractography and ulnar 
      nerve diffusion tensor imaging at the cubital tunnel using 3T MRI.
PG  - 284185120951965
LID - 10.1177/0284185120951965 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Small peripheral nerve tractography is challenging because of the 
      trade-off among resolution, image acquisition time, and signal-to-noise ratio. 
      PURPOSE: To optimize pixel size and slice thickness parameters for fiber 
      tractography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the ulnar nerve at the cubital 
      tunnel using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen 
      healthy volunteers (mean age 30 ± 6.8 years) were recruited prospectively. Axial 
      T2-weighted and DTI scans were acquired, covering the cubital tunnel, using 
      different pixel sizes and slice thicknesses. Three-dimensional (3D) nerve 
      tractography was evaluated for the median number and length of the reconstructed 
      fiber tracts and visual score from 0 to 5. Two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional DTI 
      was evaluated for fractional anisotropy (FA) values throughout the length of the 
      ulnar nerve. RESULTS: A pixel size of 1.3 mm(2) revealed the highest number of 
      reconstructed nerve fibers compared to that of 1.1 mm(2) (P = 0.048), with a good 
      visual score. A slice thickness of 4 mm had the highest number of reconstructed 
      nerve fibers and visual score compared with other thicknesses (all P < 0.05). In 2D 
      cross-sectional images, the median FA values were in the range of 0.40-0.63 at the 
      proximal, central, and distal portions of the cubital tunnel. Inter-observer 
      agreement for all parameters was good to excellent. CONCLUSION: For fiber 
      tractography and DTI of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel, optimal image quality

      in Brachial Plexus Birth Palsy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Which infants with brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP) should undergo 
      microsurgical plexus reconstruction remains controversial. The current gold standard 
      for the decision for plexus reconstruction is serial clinical examinations, but this 
      approach obviates the possibility of early surgical treatment. We hypothesize that a 
      new technique using 3-dimensional volumetric proton density magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) without sedation can evaluate the severity of BPBP injury earlier than 
      serial clinical examinations. METHODS: Infants were prospectively enrolled prior to 
      12 weeks of age and imaged using 3 Tesla MRI without sedation. Clinical scores were 
      collected at all visits. The imaging findings were graded based on the number of 
      injured levels and the severity of each injury, and a radiological score was 
      calculated. All infants were followed at least until the decision for surgery was 
      made based on clinical examination. RESULTS: Nine infants completed the MRI scan and 
      clinical follow-up. The average Toronto score at presentation was 4.4 out of 10 
      (range, 0-8.2); the average Active Movement Scale score was 50 out of 105 (range, 
      0-86). Four infants required surgery: 2 because of a flail limb and Horner syndrome 
      and 2 owing to failure to recover antigravity elbow flexion by age 6 months. 
      Radiological scores ranged from 0 to 18 out of a maximum score of 25. The average 
      radiological score for those infants who required surgery was 12 (range, 6.5-18), 
      whereas the average score for infants who did not require surgery was 3.5 (range, 
      0-8). CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional proton density MRI can evaluate spinal nerve 
      roots in infants without the need for radiation, contrast agents, or sedation. These 
      data suggest that MRI can help determine the severity of injury earlier than 
      clinical examination in infants with BPBP, although further study of a larger sample 
      of infants with varying severity of disease is necessary. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Diagnostic II.

TI  - Does IIH Alter Brain Microstructures? - A DTI-Based Approach.
PG  - 746-755
LID - 10.1111/head.13039 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To investigate the correlation of microstructural parameters with CSF 
      pressure and macroscopic changes assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 
      patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). METHODS: Twenty-three 
      patients with IIH as well as age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls 
      underwent high resolution MR imaging of the optic nerve sheaths (ONS), pituitary 
      gland, and ventricles. For DTI data a voxelwise permutation analysis was performed 
      for the whole brain and ROI analysis was performed for the optic nerve and optic 
      radiation. DTI measurements were correlated to morphometric measurements, CSF 
      opening pressure, and headache intensity. The reliability of diagnostic performance 
      of DTI parameters was assessed using ROC analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of DTI metrics 
      revealed a significant reduction in the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the optic 
      nerve in patients with IIH. In contrast, systematic regional variations between IIH 
      patients and controls were neither observed in the whole brain analysis nor in the 
      optic radiation. FA values of the optic nerve show significant correlations with the 
      optic nerve sheath diameter (P = .003, r = -.589). The correlation of the 
      alterations of the FA values of the optic radiation and the whole brain do not show 
      a significant association to morphometric alterations in the ONS diameter and 
      hypophysis height as well as to CSF opening pressure and headache intensity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that IIH is associated with microstructural 
      changes in the optic nerve. These alterations may be the direct consequence of 
      chronically elevated intracranial pressure.

TI  - Highly efficient head-only magnetic field insert gradient coil for achieving 
      simultaneous high gradient amplitude and slew rate at 3.0T (MAGNUS) for brain 
      microstructure imaging.
PG  - 2356-2369
LID - 10.1002/mrm.28087 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a highly efficient magnetic field gradient coil for head imaging 
      that achieves 200 mT/m and 500 T/m/s on each axis using a standard 1 MVA gradient 
      driver in clinical whole-body 3.0T MR magnet. METHODS: A 42-cm inner diameter 
      head-gradient used the available 89- to 91-cm warm bore space in a whole-body 3.0T 
      magnet by increasing the radial separation between the primary and the shield coil 
      windings to 18.6 cm. This required the removal of the standard whole-body gradient 
      and radiofrequency coils. To achieve a coil efficiency ~4× that of whole-body 
      gradients, a double-layer primary coil design with asymmetric x-y axes, and 
      symmetric z-axis was used. The use of all-hollow conductor with direct fluid cooling 
      of the gradient coil enabled ≥50 kW of total heat dissipation. RESULTS: This design 
      achieved a coil efficiency of 0.32 mT/m/A, allowing 200 mT/m and 500 T/m/s for a 620 
      A/1500 V driver. The gradient coil yielded substantially reduced echo spacing, and 
      minimum repetition time and echo time. In high b = 10,000 s/mm(2) diffusion, echo 
      time (TE) < 50 ms was achieved (>50% reduction compared with whole-body gradients). 
      The gradient coil passed the American College of Radiology tests for gradient 
      linearity and distortion, and met acoustic requirements for nonsignificant risk 
      operation. CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-high gradient coil performance was achieved for head 
      imaging without substantial increases in gradient driver power in a whole-body 3.0T 
      magnet after removing the standard gradient coil. As such, any clinical whole-body 
      3.0T MR system could be upgraded with 3-4× improvement in gradient performance for 
      brain imaging.

      hysterectomy.
PG  - 4561-4569

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present in vivo female pelvic autonomous innervation and the 
      relationship between nerves and their related organs by three-dimensional (3D) 
      reconstruction based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Thirty patients 
      with cervical cancer who underwent pelvic MRI and agreed to undergo additional 
      magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) sequences were enrolled in the present study. 
      MRI images from the same patient were acquired using T2-weighted fat saturation (T2W 
      FS) and 3D-STIR-SPACE sequences. Detailed two-dimensional (2D) segmentation and 3D 
      reconstruction of pelvic autonomic nerves (PAN) were performed on the basis of the 
      images of the two sequences using 3D reconstruction software. The 2D segmentation 
      and 3D reconstruction of pelvic organs were based on T2W FS images. The consistency 
      of the 3D models of pelvic autonomous innervation constructed from the two sequences 
      were analysed and compared, the pelvic autonomous innervation was presented, and the 
      relationship between nerves and their related organs was characterised. RESULTS: The 
      3D reconstructions of PAN were successfully obtained from 3D-STIR-SPACE and T2W FS 
      sequences in 30 patients and showed high correspondence. T2W FS images also enabled 
      3D reconstructions of pelvic organs to visualise the 3D distribution of PAN and the 
      positional relationships between nerves and their related organs. CONCLUSION: The 
      pelvic autonomic nerves and their related organs can be reconstructed on the basis 
      of MRI to present personalised 3D anatomical information and offer individualised 
      guidance during nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (NSRH). KEY POINTS: • 
      Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy is a developing trend in cervical cancer surgery 
      • MRI allows reconstructions of pelvic autonomic nerves and their related organs • 
      The 3D reconstructions provide detailed 3D anatomical information on nerves.

AB  - This study aims to find accurate angles and depths of lateral ventricle puncture 
      using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reconstruction, as well as to provide an 
      optimized and alternative puncturing strategy.A total of 90 computed tomography (CT) 
      images and 30 CT images with DTI were analyzed. The measurements were performed on 
      coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes. Some distances and angles were measured to 
      determine the best angle and penetration depth during the puncture process. 
      Important landmarks of the lateral ventricle were also measured, and a comparison of 
      the differences between 2 hemispheres was also assessed.It showed that the vertical 
      distance from the superior margin to inferior margin of the lateral ventricle was 
      22.2 ± 0.5 mm and the length was 124.1 ± 2.1 mm. In the frontal horn puncture 
      approach, the penetration depth should be limited between 105.2 and 109.4 mm, the 
      angle should be 71.6 ± 2.7°. During the occipital horn puncture approach, puncturing 
      depth was from 90.7 to 111.4 mm, and angle was 15.3 ± 1.8°. Through the parietal 
      lobe puncture approach, which was firstly brought out in this study, the puncturing 
      length should be 124.4 to 130.2 mm and angle was 56.6 ± 2.0°.The traditional 
      recommended protocol of lateral ventricle puncture is not accurate, the refined 
      lateral ventricle puncture protocol established in this study will reduce injury and 
      remain function. A DTI imaging examination combining with nerve fibers 
      reconstruction were strongly recommended before lateral ventricle puncture, which 
      will help neurosurgeons to determine the best puncturing angles and depth.

TI  - Anatomic MR imaging and functional diffusion tensor imaging of peripheral nerve 
      tumors and tumorlike conditions.
PG  - 802-7
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A3316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A number of benign and malignant peripheral nerve tumor and 
      tumorlike conditions produce similar imaging features on conventional anatomic MR 
      imaging. Functional MR imaging using DTI can increment the diagnostic performance in 
      differentiation of these lesions. Our aim was to evaluate the role of 3T anatomic MR 
      imaging and DTI in the characterization of peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike 
      conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (13 men, 16 women; mean age, 
      41±18 years; range, 11-83 years) with a nerve tumor or tumorlike condition (25 
      benign, 5 malignant) underwent 3T MR imaging by using anatomic (n=29), functional 
      diffusion, DWI (n=21), and DTI (n=24) techniques. Images were evaluated for image 
      quality (3-point scale), ADC of the lesion, tractography, and fractional anisotropy 
      of nerves with interobserver reliability in ADC and FA measurements. RESULTS: No 
      significant differences were observed in age (benign, 40±18 versus malignant, 45±19 
      years) and sex (benign, male/female=12:12 versus malignant, male/female=3:2) 
      (P>.05). All anatomic (29/29, 100%) MR imaging studies received "good" quality; 
      20/21 (95%) DWI and 21/24 (79%) DTI studies received "good" quality. ADC of benign 
      lesions (1.848±0.40×10(-3) mm2/s) differed from that of malignant lesions 
      (0.900±0.25×10(-3) mm2/s, P<.001) with excellent interobserver reliability 
      (ICC=0.988 [95% CI, 0.976-0.994]). There were no FA or ADC differences between men 
      and women (P>.05). FA of involved nerves was lower than that in contralateral 
      healthy nerves (P<.001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC=0.970 [95% CI, 
      0.946-0.991]). ADC on DTI and DWI was not statistically different (P>.05), with 
      excellent intermethod reliability (ICC=0.943 [95% CI, 0.836-0.980]). Tractography 
      differences were observed in benign and malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS: 3T MR 
      imaging and DTI are valuable methods for anatomic and functional evaluation of 
      peripheral nerve lesions with excellent interobserver reliability. While 
      tractography and low FA provide insight into neural integrity, low diffusivity 
      values indicate malignancy in neural masses.

TI  - Central mechanisms of pain revealed through functional and structural MRI.
PG  - 518-34
LID - 10.1007/s11481-012-9386-8 [doi]
AB  - MR-based brain imaging technologies provide a suite of functional and structural 
      metrics that can be used to test hypotheses about the CNS mechanisms underlying pain 
      perception and chronification, from a cellular level to a systems level. Two types 
      of functional MRI discussed in this review provide insight into pain mechanisms: 
      stimulus-evoked fMRI and task-free ("resting state") fMRI. The former can assess how 
      the brain responds to noxious or non-noxious stimuli normally or in a chronic pain 
      state as a window into understanding pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. The latter 
      can assess functional connectivity reflecting synchronous ultra-slow frequency 
      oscillation between brain areas. This provides insight into how brain areas work 
      together as networks to produce pain and how these networks may be modified due to 
      chronic pain. Perfusion MR (e.g., arterial spin labeling) can also provide task-free 
      information pertaining to ongoing brain activity that may reflect spontaneous 
      (ongoing) chronic pain. Structural MR techniques can be used to delineate gray and 
      white matter abnormalities and markers of neuroinflammation associated with chronic 
      pains. Functional and structural MRI findings point to brain and peripheral nerve 
      abnormalities in patients with chronic pain, some of which are pre-existing and 
      others that develop with prolonged pain (and related neuroinflammation) over time. 
      Recent studies indicate that some structural brain abnormalities associated with 
      chronic pain are reversible following effective pain treatment. These data together 
      with findings from studies of individual differences suggest that some chronic pains 
      arise from a combination of pre-existing vulnerabilities and sustained abnormal 
      input.

TI  - Morphometric evaluation of facial and vestibulocochlear nerves using magnetic 
      resonance imaging: comparison of Menière's disease ears with normal hearing ears.
PG  - 3029-3039
LID - 10.1007/s00405-017-4616-6 [doi]
AB  - Loss of neural structures (such as hair cells or neurones within the spiral 
      ganglion) has been proposed to be involved in Menière's disease (MD) (Spoendlin et 
      al. Acta oto-laryngologica Supplementum 499:1-21, 1; Merchant et al. Eur Arch 
      Oto-Rhino-Laryngol Off J Eur Feder Oto-Rhino-Laryngol Soc (EUFOS) Affil German Soc 
      Oto-Rhino-Laryngol Head Neck Surg 252(2):63-75, 2; Tsuji et al. Ann Otol Rhinol 
      Laryngol Suppl 81:26-31, 3; Kariya, Otol Neurotol Off Publ Am Otol Soc Am Neurotol 
      Soc Eur Acad Otol Neurotol 28(8):1063-1068, 4; Megerian Laryngoscope 
      115(9):1525-1535, 5) but this has yet to be confirmed. Therefore, the aim of this 
      study was to investigate morphometric changes of VIIth and VIIIth cranial nerve in 
      MD. MD is characterized by episodic vertigo, tinnitus, fluctuating hearing loss, and 
      aural fullness. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms involved such as viral 
      infections, autoimmune processes, genetic predisposition, cellular apoptosis, and 
      oxidative stress are still not clear. Using a T2-weighted 3D-GE "constructive 
      interference in steady state" (CISS) 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence, 
      we evaluated the properties of the VIIth and VIIIth cranial nerves as they passed 
      from the cerebellopontine angle to the inner ear modiolus. 21 patients with MD were 
      examined along with 39 normal controls. Bidirectional nerve diameters and 
      cross-sectional areas (CSA) were measured in a transverse plane. The comparison of 
      study and control group showed statistically significant (P < 0.000595 after 
      Bonferroni correction) differences between the CSA measurements. The facial, 
      cochlear, superior vestibular, and inferior vestibular nerves (FN, CN, SVN, IVN) of 
      MD patients were significantly larger than those of the control group, both on the 
      MD-affected side and on the healthy side. Thus for example, the cochlear nerve CSA 
      measurements were 0.69 ± 0.14 mm(2) (P < 0.0001) in the affected ears of the 
      unilateral MD group, 0.70 ± 0.12 mm(2) (P < 0.0001) in the affected ears of the 
      cohort including the bilateral MD group, 0.71 ± 0.13 mm(2) (P < 0.0001) in the 
      non-affected ears of the MD patients, as compared to 0.46 ± 0.14 mm(2) in the 
      control group. The perpendicular nerve diameters were found to vary according to 
      site of measurement and type of measurement used. For example a statistically 
      significant enlargement of the short diameter measurements of the SVN at the level 
      of the meatus was found, but not of long diameter measurements at the same site. 
      Although cellular death would theoretically be expected to lead to a decreased nerve 
      thickness, our data showed a swelling of cranial nerves VII and VIII within the 
      study group compared to our normal hearing control group. The similar reaction of 
      the facial nerve supports mediator-based theories of MD pathophysiology.

TI  - Tumor segmentation of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging in neurofibromatosis 
      type 1 patients: tumor burden correlates.
PG  - 93-99
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Segmentation of whole-body MRI (WBMRI) to assess the feasibility, 
      quantitate the total tumor volume (tumor burden) in patients with neurofibromatosis 
      type 1 (NF1) and examine associations with demographic, disease-related and 
      anthropomorphic features. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with NF1 
      underwent WBMRI and were reviewed for tumors. Tumors were segmented using a 
      semiautomated software-based tool. Tumors were classified as superficial or deep and 
      discrete or plexiform. Segmentation times were recorded. Segmentation yielded the 
      quantity and tumor burden of superficial, internal and plexiform tumors. 
      Correlations between segmentation data and demographic, disease-related and 
      anthropomorphic features were examined. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were evaluated 
      (42.3 ± 13.6 years, 10 female, 5 male). Segmentation times were a median of 30 min 
      and yielded 2,328 tumors (1,582 superficial, 746 internal and 23 plexiform). One 
      tumor was malignant. Tumor counts ranged from 14 to 397. Tumor burden ranged from 
      6.95 cm3 to 571 cm3. Individual tumor volume ranged from 0.0120 cm3 to 298 cm3. 
      Significant correlation was found between the total volume of superficial tumors and 
      height (ρ = 0.5966, p < 0.02). Male patients had higher overall tumor burdens 
      (p < 0.05) and higher superficial tumor burden (p < 0.03). Patients with negative 
      family history had more tumors (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Segmentation of WBMRI in 
      patients with NF1 is feasible and elucidates meaningful relationships among disease 
      phenotype, anthropomorphic and demographic features.

TI  - Can imaging be the new yardstick for diagnosing peripheral neuropathy?-a comparison 
      between high resolution ultrasound and MR neurography with an approach to diagnosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Peripheral neuropathies are a group of disorders which affect the 
      peripheral nervous system which have been conventionally diagnosed using 
      electrodiagnostic studies. This study was carried out to assess the role of imaging 
      in diagnosing peripheral mononeuropathy as exact anatomical localisation of the 
      pathology is possible using high-resolution ultrasound and MR neurography, the 
      modalities assessed in this study. METHOD: A hospital-based prospective analytical 
      study was carried out in a resource-limited setting on 180 peripheral nerves in 131 
      patients with symptoms of peripheral mononeuropathy after taking IRB approval. Each 
      patient underwent high-resolution ultrasound examination and MR neurography, 
      findings of which were then compared and statistically analysed assuming 
      electrodiagnostic findings as the gold standard. RESULTS: Overall, the diagnostic 
      accuracy was highest for the proton density fat-saturated MR sequence (93.89%) 
      followed by high-resolution ultrasound (80%). The sensitivity was highest for proton 
      density fat-saturated sequence while the T1 MR sequence had the highest specificity. 
      Combined diagnostic accuracy of both modalities was calculated to be 93.33% with a 
      negative predictive value of 80%. High-resolution ultrasound and MRI equally 
      detected the cases with nerve discontinuity, while neuromas were better identified 
      on MRI. CONCLUSION: With the advent of higher frequency probes and improved MR field 
      strength, imaging of peripheral nerves is possible with better accuracy. Imaging 
      assessment of nerves allows anatomical delineation with identification of exact site 
      of involvement. This comparative study demonstrates the role of imaging in 
      diagnosing peripheral nerve pathologies with the accuracy of MRI as high as 93.89% 
      which may serve as an imaging gold standard. High-resolution ultrasound, being 
      quicker, cost effective and a comparable accuracy of 80% can serve as a reliable 
      screening tool. This study incorporates a larger study group and compares HRUS with 
      MRI, taking NCV as gold standard, which has not been done in the preceding studies. 
      With this study, we conclude that these two imaging modalities are not mutually 
      exclusive. Rather, they complement each other and can be used in conjunction as an 
      imaging yardstick for diagnosing peripheral neuropathies.

TI  - Magnetic resonance neuroimaging study of brain structural differences in diabetic 
      peripheral neuropathy.
PG  - 1681-8
LID - 10.2337/dc13-2610 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) has hitherto been considered a 
      disease of the peripheral nervous system only, with central nervous system (CNS) 
      involvement largely overlooked. The aim of this study was to investigate any 
      differences in brain structure in subjects with DPN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      Thirty-six subjects with type 1 diabetes (No DPN [n = 18], Painful DPN [n = 9], 
      Painless DPN [n = 9]) underwent neurophysiological assessment to quantify the 
      severity of DPN. All subjects, including 18 healthy volunteers (HVs), underwent 
      volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. RESULTS: Adjusted peripheral 
      gray matter volume was statistically significantly lower in subjects with painless 
      and painful DPN (mean 599.6 mL [SEM 9.8 mL] and 585.4 mL [10.0 mL], respectively) 
      compared with those with No DPN (626.5 mL [5.7 mL]) and HVs (639.9 mL [7.2 mL]; 
      ANCOVA, P = 0.001). The difference in adjusted peripheral gray matter volume between 
      subjects with No DPN and HVs and those with Painful DPN and Painless DPN was not 
      statistically significant (P = 0.16 and 0.30, respectively). Voxel-based morphometry 
      analyses revealed greater localized volume loss in the primary somatosensory cortex, 
      supramarginal gyrus, and cingulate cortex (corrected P < 0.05) in DPN subjects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to focus on structural changes in the brain 
      associated with DPN. Our findings suggest increased peripheral gray matter volume 
      loss, localized to regions involved with somatosensory perception in subjects with 
      DPN. This may have important implications for the long-term prognosis of DPN.

TI  - Correlation between nerve atrophy, brain grey matter volume and pain severity in 
      patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia.
PG  - 515-525
LID - 10.1177/0333102418793643 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent neuroimaging studies have reported grey matter alterations in 
      primary trigeminal neuralgia patients. However, few studies have focused on 
      quantitative measurements of trigeminal nerves and the interaction between 
      trigeminal nerve volume and brain morphology, particularly grey matter volume. In 
      this study, we investigated the link between trigeminal nerves and grey matter 
      volume changes in primary trigeminal neuralgia patients compared to healthy 
      controls. Moreover, we explored the association of structure of trigeminal nerves 
      and grey matter to collected pain clinical variables. METHODS: Eighty participants 
      (40 patients and 40 controls) were recruited for the study. All participants 
      underwent MRI sessions and clinical pain assessment. Trigeminal nerve volume and 
      whole brain grey matter volume were evaluated using quantitative imaging techniques. 
      Sensory and affective pain rating indices were assessed using the visual analog 
      scale and short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire. Mediation analysis was conducted to 
      investigate the relationship between clinical pain variables and volumetric changes 
      in trigeminal nerves and grey matter. RESULTS: Decreased trigeminal nerve volume was 
      detected in primary trigeminal neuralgia patients compared to controls. 
      Additionally, reduced grey matter volume was found in several regions associated 
      with pain in primary trigeminal neuralgia subjects, including the insula, secondary 
      somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and 
      several areas of the temporal lobe. Mediation analysis revealed that decreased 
      trigeminal nerve volume drove grey matter volume abnormality of the left insula, and 
      further led to increased pain ratings. CONCLUSION: This study showed a predominantly 
      direct effect of trigeminal nerve atrophy on clinical pain variables in primary 
      trigeminal neuralgia patients, providing new insight into the pathophysiology of the 
      disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02713646.

TI  - Carpal tunnel syndrome assessment with diffusion tensor imaging: Value of fractional 
      anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient.
PG  - 1111-1117
LID - 10.1007/s00330-017-5046-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively assess carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) with DTI by 
      evaluating two approaches to determine cut-off values. METHODS: In forty patients 
      with CTS diagnosis confirmed by nerve conduction studies (NCs) and 14 healthy 
      subjects (mean age 58.54 and 57.8 years), cross-sectional area (CSA), apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) at single and multiple 
      levels with intraobserver agreement were evaluated. RESULTS: Maximum and mean CSA 
      and FA showed significant differences between healthy subjects and patients (12.85 
      mm(2) vs. 28.18 mm(2), p < 0.001, and 0.613 vs. 0.524, p=0.007, respectively) (10.12 
      mm(2) vs. 19.9 mm(2), p<0.001 and 0.617 vs. 0.54, p=0.003, respectively), but not 
      maximum and mean ADC (p > 0.05). For cut-off values, mean and maximum CSA showed the 
      same sensitivity and specificity (93.3 %). However, mean FA showed better 
      sensitivity than maximum FA (82.6 % vs. 73.9 %), but lower specificity (66.7 % vs. 
      80 %), and significant correlation for maximum CSA, 97 % (p < 0.01), with good 
      correlation for maximum ADC and FA, 84.5 % (p < 0.01) and 62 % (p=0.056), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CSA and FA showed significant differences between healthy 
      subjects and patients. Single measurement at maximum CSA is suitable for FA 
      determination. Key Points • DTI showed that FA is stronger than ADC for CTS 
      diagnosis. • Single- and multiple-level approaches were compared to determine FA and 
      ADC. • Single-level evaluation at the thickest MN cross-sectional area is 
      sufficient.

AB  - Two promising advances in MRI have recently evolved. Water proton directional 
      "diffusion" as well as "perfusion" processes can be imaged in a rapid (on the order 
      of milliseconds) and accurate manner. MR diffusion imaging is shown to effectively 
      allow determination of the presence of anisotropic water diffusion in animal and 
      human cerebral and spinal white matter and in peripheral nerves. In another 
      important application, the measured apparent water proton diffusion is observed to 
      be significantly slowed in cerebral gray matter within the first minutes following 
      experimental stroke suggesting that MRI could be useful in rapid initial assessments 
      of ischemic damage. MR contrast media can cause regional changes due to either 
      magnetic susceptibility-induced T2* shortening or to paramagnetic-induced T1 
      shortening. The passage of a contrast bolus through the microcirculation can be 
      monitored using high-speed MRI and can provide significant contrast enhancement in 
      ischemic and normally perfused tissues.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of whole-body magnetic resonance neurography 
      (WBMRN) in polyneuropathy for technical feasibility, distribution of nerve 
      abnormalities, and differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty WBMRN examinations 
      were performed on a 3T scanner over 2 years. Patient demographics including history 
      of hereditary and acquired neuropathy were recorded. The images were evaluated by 
      two independent readers with nerve imaging experience for quality. The nerve signal 
      and size alterations were measured in the brachial plexus, lumbosacral plexus, and 
      femoral and sciatic nerves; diffusion tensor imaging parameters (fractional 
      anisotropy [FA] and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) were determined in 
      plexuses, and tractography was performed. Nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test, 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and intraclass correlation 
      coefficients (ICCs) were obtained. RESULTS: Excellent image quality was obtained for 
      the majority of lumbosacral (LS) plexus (18/20) and 50% of brachial plexus (10/20) 
      regions. Qualitatively among cases, the nerve hyperintensity and/or thickening 
      involved the brachial plexus (11/11), LS plexus (7/11), and both plexuses (7/11), 
      with most nerve thickenings observed in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1. The 
      nerve signal intensity alterations were significantly different for both brachial (P 
      < 0.05) and LS (P < 0.05) plexuses in cases versus controls. The femoral and sciatic 
      nerve size alterations were different (P < 0.05), while signal intensity differences 
      were not significant (P = 0.1-0.97). Transverse dimensions of C8 (4 mm), L5 (6.2 mm) 
      and S1 (5.1 mm) nerve roots, and sciatic nerves (10.2 mm) were the most accurate 
      diagnostic performance measures in distinguishing cases from controls. CONCLUSION: 
      WBMRN is feasible for use in the clinical practice for the identification and 
      potential characterization of polyneuropathy. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

AB  - Growing evidence indicates that alterations within the peripheral nervous system 
      (PNS) are involved at an early stage in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
      pathogenetic cascade. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
      neurophysiologic analyses, and histologic analyses were used to monitor the extent 
      of PNS damage in the hSOD-1 ALS rat model. The imaging signature of the disease was 
      defined using in vivo MRI of the sciatic nerve. Initial abnormalities were detected 
      in the nerves by an increase in T2 relaxation time before the onset of clinical 
      disease; diffusion MRI showed a progressive increase in mean and radial diffusivity 
      and reduction of fractional anisotropy at advanced stages of disease. Histologic 
      analysis demonstrated early impairment of the blood-nerve barrier followed by acute 
      axonal degeneration associated with endoneurial edema and macrophage response in 
      motor nerve compartments. Progressive axonal degeneration and motor nerve fiber loss 
      correlated with MRI and neurophysiologic changes. These functional and morphologic 
      investigations of the PNS might be applied in following disease progression in 
      preclinical therapeutic studies. This study establishes the PNS signature in this 
      rat ALS model (shedding new light into pathogenesis) and provides a rationale for 
      translating into future systematic MRI studies of PNS involvement in patients with 
      ALS.

AB  - Central nervous system involvement has been described in peripheral neuropathies, 
      including different forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The aim of our study 
      was to systematically investigate possible brain structural modifications in CMT1A 
      patients, using volumetric MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this 
      prospective cross-sectional study, from May 2017 to May 2019, we acquired 3T MRI 
      brain scans of genetically confirmed CMT1A patients and age- and sex-comparable 
      healthy controls. Patients also underwent clinical and electrophysiological 
      examinations assessing motor and sensory domains. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and 
      tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were performed using a non-parametric 
      approach based on permutations, including age and sex (and total intracranial volume 
      for VBM) as nuisance covariates. When between-group differences emerged at VBM or 
      TBSS analyses, the first eigenvariate was extracted from the cluster and its age- 
      and sex-adjusted standardized residuals tested for correlation with clinical and 
      electrophysiological variables. Twenty CMT1A patients (34.5 ± 11.1 years; M/F:11/9) 
      were enrolled, along with 20 healthy controls (30.1 ± 10.2 years; M/F:11/9). The VBM 
      analysis revealed clusters of significantly increased GM volume in CMT1A patients 
      compared to healthy controls, encompassing the bilateral cerebellar lobules III-VI 
      and the left hippocampus (all ps = 0.04), with no differences in terms of DTI 
      metrics at the TBSS analysis. A negative correlation (r = -0.502, p = 0.03) emerged 
      between ulnar compound motor action potential and the z-scores corresponding to the 
      right cerebellar cluster of augmented GM volume. Our data show evidence of 
      structural reorganization in the brain of CMT1A patients, possibly reflecting neural 
      plasticity mechanisms in response to peripheral nerve pathology and modulating the 
      effect of axonal degeneration on functional impairment.

TI  - Magnetic resonance appearance of peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
PG  - 9-14
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate 22 histologically proven 
      peripheral nerve sheath tumors, approximately two-thirds of which arose in the lower 
      extremity. The histologic distribution was as follows: 12 schwannomas, 7 
      neurofibromas, and 3 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (2 of which occurred 
      in patients with neurofibromatosis). Most lesions demonstrated an intermediate to 
      moderately bright signal on T1-weighted images and were minimally inhomogeneous. All 
      lesions were moderately bright on proton-density-weighted images and bright on 
      T2-weighted images, again with variable inhomogeneity. The extent of the tumor was 
      best assessed on proton-density- and T2-weighted images. Smooth margins were noted 
      in 19 lesions. Of the 3 remaining lesions, 2 were malignant (but had been subjected 
      to biopsy prior to MRI), and the other lesion was a plexiform neurofibroma. MRI 
      accurately determined the relationship between the lesion and the adjacent 
      neurovascular structures and muscles, thereby assisting surgical management. On MRI, 
      5 lesions demonstrated coexistent subtle muscle atrophy along the longitudinal axis 
      of surrounding or distally innervated musculature. This latter finding, together 
      with the presence of a tumor in the vicinity of a large nerve trunk, suggests a 
      peripheral nerve sheath neoplasm.

AB  - This study correlated morphologic abnormalities of idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome 
      (CTS) with the severity of CTS using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The 
      relationship of the severity of CTS and the cross-sectional area of the median nerve 
      (CSA) was assessed at several levels. Seventy wrists of 35 patients (27 women and 8 
      men) with unilateral idiopathic CTS underwent nerve conduction study and 3-T MRI of 
      the wrist. The CSA at 4 levels (distal radioulnar joint, body of scaphoid, tubercule 
      of scaphoid, and hook of hamate) and the thickness of the transverse carpal ligament 
      at 3 levels in both affected and unaffected hands were measured using 3-T MRI and 
      correlated with the severity of CTS assessed with distal motor latency. The CSA in 
      the affected hand at the scaphoid body level was significantly higher than in the 
      unaffected hand. The CSA at the scaphoid body level was positively correlated with 
      distal motor latency in the affected hand. The CSA in the affected hand at the 
      scaphoid tubercule level was significantly lower than in the unaffected hand. The 
      CSA had a negative correlation with distal motor latency at the scaphoid tubercule 
      level. The CSA at the distal radioulnar joint and the hamate hook was not 
      significantly different between the affected hand and the unaffected hand. The CSA 
      at the distal radioulnar joint level and hook level were not correlated 
      significantly with distal motor latency in the affected hand. The mean CSA of the 
      affected hand at the scaphoid body level was highest in 4 levels. [Orthopedics.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging of myelin.
PG  - 460-84
AB  - The ability to measure myelin in vivo has great consequences for furthering our 
      knowledge of normal development, as well as for understanding a wide range of 
      neurological disorders. The following review summarizes the current state of myelin 
      imaging using MR. We consider five MR techniques that have been used to study 
      myelin: 1) conventional MR, 2) MR spectroscopy, 3) diffusion, 4) magnetization 
      transfer, and 5) T2 relaxation. Fundamental studies involving peripheral nerve and 
      MR/histology comparisons have aided in the interpretation and validation of MR data. 
      We highlight a number of important findings related to myelin development, damage, 
      and repair, and we conclude with a critical summary of the current techniques 
      available and their potential to image myelin in vivo.

TI  - Visualization of nerve fibers and their relationship to peripheral nerve tumors by 
      diffusion tensor imaging.
PG  - E16
LID - 10.3171/2015.6.FOCUS15235 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT The majority of growing and/or symptomatic peripheral nerve tumors are 
      schwannomas and neurofibromas. They are almost always benign and can usually be 
      resected while minimizing motor and sensory deficits if approached with the proper 
      expertise and techniques. Intraoperative electrophysiological stimulation and 
      recording techniques allow the surgeon to map the surface of the tumor in an effort 
      to identify and thus avoid damaging functioning nerve fibers. Recently, MR diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) techniques have permitted the visualization of axons, because 
      of their anisotropic properties, in peripheral nerves. The object of this study was 
      to compare the distribution of nerve fibers as revealed by direct electrical 
      stimulation with that seen on preoperative MR DTI. METHODS The authors conducted a 
      retrospective chart review of patients with a peripheral nerve or nerve root tumor 
      between March 2012 and January 2014. Diffusion tensor imaging and intraoperative 
      data had been prospectively collected for patients with peripheral nerve tumors that 
      were resected. Preoperative identification of the nerve fiber location in relation 
      to the nerve tumor surface as seen on DTI studies was compared with the nerve 
      fiber's intraoperative localization using electrophysiological stimulation and 
      recordings. RESULTS In 23 patients eligible for study there was good correlation 
      between nerve fiber location on DTI and its anatomical location seen 
      intraoperatively. Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated the relationship of nerve 
      fibers relative to the tumor with 95.7% sensitivity, 66.7% specificity, 75% positive 
      predictive value, and 93.8% negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative DTI 
      techniques are useful in helping the peripheral nerve surgeon to both determine the 
      risks involved in resecting a nerve tumor and plan the safest surgical approach.

TI  - Non-Sedated Rapid Volumetric Proton Density MRI Predicts Neonatal Brachial Plexus 
      Birth Palsy Functional Outcome.
PG  - 248-254
LID - 10.1111/jon.12389 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The current prognostic biomarker of functional outcome in 
      brachial plexus birth palsy is serial clinical examination throughout the first 6 
      months of age. This can delay surgical treatment and prolong parental anxiety in 
      neonates who will recover spontaneously. A potentially superior biomarker is a 
      volumetric proton density MRI performed at clinical presentation and within the 
      first 12 weeks of life, providing a high spatial and contrast resolution examination 
      in 4 minutes. METHODS: Nine neonates ranging in age from 4 to 9 weeks who presented 
      with brachial plexus birth palsy were enrolled. All subjects underwent non-sedated 3 
      Tesla MRI with Cube Proton Density MRI sequence at the same time as their initial 
      clinical visit. Serial clinical examinations were conducted at routine 4 week 
      intervals and the functional performance scores were recorded. MRI findings were 
      divided into pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic injuries and a radiological scoring 
      system (Shriners Radiological Score) was developed for this study. RESULTS: Proton 
      Density MRI was able to differentiate between pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic 
      injuries. Radiological scores (Shriners Radiological Score) correlated better with 
      functional performance at 6 months of age (P = .022) than the initial clinical 
      examinations (Active Movement Scale P = .213 and Toronto P = .320). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Rapid non-sedated volumetric Cube Proton Density MRI protocol performed at initial 
      clinical presentation can accurately grade severity of brachial plexus birth palsy 
      injury and predict functional performance at 6 months of age.

AB  - European Radiology Experimental reached the first 100 articles published in two 
      years. Rejection rate was 30%, publication rate increased from 3.5/month in the 
      first 12-month period to 4.8/month in the second 12-month period. The journal 
      metrics were: 25 days from submission to first decision, 96 days from submission to 
      acceptance, and 69 days from acceptance to publication. At the end of May 2019, we 
      accumulated a total of 82,367 article accesses, 541 Altmetric score, and 110 
      citations for 92 published articles. Europe accounted for 85% of article origin. One 
      third of corresponding authors were not radiologists/radiology residents, but were 
      rather mainly physicists, engineers, or computer scientists. The distribution among 
      subspecialties/body parts was well balanced; 9% of the topics regarded patient's 
      safety, radioprotection, or contrast media. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
      computed tomography (CT) accounted for 71% of the articles. Twenty-two percent of 
      original articles/technical notes reported on animal models, 15% on phantoms, 3% on 
      in silico, 2% on human cadavers, and 2% on cells. Nine articles regarded artificial 
      intelligence and/or radiomics, and 2 regarded augmented reality. Of 100 articles, 57 
      declared funding sources. A total of 517 independent reviews were performed by 92 
      reviewers. The five articles quoted the most regarded augmented reality, spectral 
      photon-counting CT, artificial intelligence, MRI radiomics, and diffusion tensor 
      imaging of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems. The journal is 
      complying with aims and scope of its "experimental" profile.

TI  - Volumetric MRI Analysis of Plexiform Neurofibromas in Neurofibromatosis Type 1: 
      Comparison of Two Methods.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are complex, histologically benign 
      peripheral nerve sheath tumors that are challenging to measure by simple line 
      measurements. Computer-aided volumetric segmentation of PN has become the 
      recommended method to assess response in clinical trials directed at PN. Different 
      methods for volumetric analysis of PN have been developed. The goal of this study is 
      to test the level of agreement in volume measurements and in interval changes using 
      two separate methods of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis. METHODS: 
      Three independent volume measurements were performed on 15 PN imaged at three 
      time-points using 3DQI software at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and National 
      Cancer Institute (NCI) and MEDx software at NCI. RESULTS: Median volume differences 
      at each time-point comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were -0.5, -4.2, and -19.9 mL; 
      comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were -21.0, -47.0, and -21.0 mL; comparing MGH-3DQI 
      and NCI-MEDx were -10.0, -70.3, and -29.9 mL. Median differences in percentage 
      change over time comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were -1.7, 1.1, and -1.0%; 
      comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were -2.3, 3.3, and -1.1%; comparing MGH-3DQI and 
      NCI-MEDx were -0.4, 2.0, and -1.5%. Volume differences were <20% of the mean of the 
      two measurements in 117 of 135 comparisons (86.7%). Difference in interval change 
      was <20% in 120 of the 135 comparisons (88.9%), while disease status classification 
      was concordant in 115 of 135 comparisons (85.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The volumes, interval 
      changes, and progression status classifications were in good agreement. The 
      comparison of two volumetric analysis methods suggests no systematic differences in 
      tumor assessment. A prospective comparison of the two methods is planned.

AB  - Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking is used for 
      3-dimensional visualization of the nervous system. Peripheral nerves and all cranial 
      nerves, except for the olfactory tract, have previously been visualized. The 
      olfactory tracts are difficult to depict with diffusion-weighted imaging due to the 
      high sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts at the base of the skull. Here we 
      report an optimized single-shot diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence that 
      can visualize the olfactory tracts with fiber tracking. Five healthy individuals 
      were examined, and the olfactory tracts could be fiber tracked with the 
      diffusion-weighted sequence. For comparison and as a negative control, an anosmic 
      patient was examined. No olfactory tracts were visualized on T2-weighted nor 
      diffusion-weighted fiber tracking images. Measuring diffusion in the olfactory 
      tracts promise to facilitate the identification of different hyposmic and anosmic 
      conditions.

TI  - Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study shows progressive pyramidal and 
      callosal damage in Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - 70-8
LID - 10.1002/mds.26436 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord and peripheral nerves are classically known to be damaged 
      in Friedreich's ataxia, but the extent of cerebral involvement in the disease and 
      its progression over time are not yet characterized. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate longitudinally cerebral damage in Friedreich's ataxia. METHODS: We enrolled 
      31 patients and 40 controls, which were evaluated at baseline and after 1 and 2 
      years. To assess gray matter, we employed voxel-based morphometry and cortical 
      thickness measurements. White matter was evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging. 
      Statistical analyses were both cross-sectional and longitudinal (corrected for 
      multiple comparisons). RESULTS: Group comparison between patients and controls 
      revealed widespread macrostructural differences at baseline: gray matter atrophy in 
      the dentate nuclei, brainstem, and precentral gyri; and white matter atrophy in the 
      cerebellum and superior cerebellar peduncles, brainstem, and periventricular areas. 
      We did not identify any longitudinal volumetric change over time. There were 
      extensive microstructural alterations, including superior cerebellar peduncles, 
      corpus callosum, and pyramidal tracts. Longitudinal analyses identified progressive 
      microstructural abnormalities at the corpus callosum, pyramidal tracts, and superior 
      cerebellar peduncles after 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Patients with 
      Friedreich's ataxia present more widespread gray and white matter damage than 
      previously reported, including not only infratentorial areas, but also 
      supratentorial structures. Furthermore, patients with Friedreich's ataxia have 
      progressive microstructural abnormalities amenable to detection in a short-term 
      follow-up.

TI  - Schwannomatosis of the Spinal Accessory Nerve: A Case Report.
PG  - e9-e13
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-1685457 [doi]
AB  - Schwannomatosis is a distinct syndrome characterized by multiple peripheral nerve 
      schwannomas that can be sporadic or familial in nature. Cases affecting the lower 
      cranial nerves are infrequent. Here, the authors present a rare case of 
      schwannomatosis affecting the left spinal accessory nerve. Upon genetic screening, 
      an in-frame insertion at codon p.R177 of the Sox 10 gene was observed. There were no 
      identifiable alterations in NF1, NF2, LZTR1, and SMARCB1. This case demonstrates a 
      rare clinical presentation of schwannomatosis in addition to a genetic aberration 
      that has not been previously reported in this disease context.

TI  - Reduced Field-of-View Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Optic Nerve in Retinitis 
      Pigmentosa at 3T.
PG  - 1510-5
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A4767 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging may reflect pathology of the optic 
      nerve; however, the ability of DTI to evaluate alterations of the optic nerve in 
      retinitis pigmentosa has not yet been assessed, to our knowledge. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the diagnostic potential of reduced FOV-DTI in optic 
      neuropathy of retinitis pigmentosa at 3T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight 
      patients and thirty-five healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Measures of 
      visual field and visual acuity of both eyes in all subjects were performed. A 
      reduced FOV-DTI sequence was used to derive fractional anisotropy, apparent 
      diffusion coefficient, principal eigenvalue, and orthogonal eigenvalue of the 
      individual optic nerves. Mean fractional anisotropy, ADC, and eigenvalue maps were 
      obtained for quantitative analysis. Further analyses were performed to determine the 
      correlation of fractional anisotropy, ADC, principal eigenvalue, and orthogonal 
      eigenvalue with optic nerves in patients with mean deviation of the visual field and 
      visual acuity, respectively. RESULTS: The optic nerves of patients with retinitis 
      pigmentosa compared with control subjects showed significantly higher ADC, principal 
      eigenvalue, and orthogonal eigenvalue and significantly lower fractional anisotropy 
      (P < .01). For patients with retinitis pigmentosa, the mean deviation of the visual 
      field of the optic nerve was significantly correlated with mean fractional 
      anisotropy (r = 0.364, P = .001) and orthogonal eigenvalue (r = -0.254, P = .029), 
      but it was not correlated with mean ADC (P = .154) and principal eigenvalue (P = 
      .337). Moreover, no correlation between any DTI parameter and visual acuity in 
      patients with retinitis pigmentosa was observed (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced 
      FOV-DTI measurement of the optic nerve may serve as a biomarker of axonal and myelin 
      damage in optic neuropathy for patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

TI  - Disease stage-dependent relationship between diffusion tensor imaging and 
      electrophysiology of the visual system in a murine model of multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 1241-1250
LID - 10.1007/s00234-017-1904-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is commonly used to evaluate white matter 
      integrity in multiple sclerosis (MS), but the relationship between DTI measures and 
      functional changes during disease remains ambiguous. Using a mouse model of MS, we 
      tested the hypothesis that DTI measures would correlate to the visual evoked 
      potential (VEPs) dynamically at different disease stages. METHODS: In vivo DTI, 
      gadolinium-enhanced T1WI (Gd-T1WI) and VEPs were performed in 5 control and 25 mice 
      after 2-12 weeks of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). DTI indices, 
      including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivities (AD and RD), 
      and Gd-T1WI enhancement, were measured in the optic nerve and tract (ON and OT), 
      which were compared with measured VEPs. RESULTS: Gd-T1WI showed a 3- to 4-fold 
      enhancement over controls beginning after 2 weeks of EAE. Across the time course, we 
      found progressive reductions in FA and increases in RD with increases in VEP latency 
      and reductions in amplitude. Significant correlations between DTI (FA and RD) and 
      VEP evolved; in control/early asymptomatic EAE mice, both FA and RD were highly 
      correlated with VEP latency (but not amplitude), while in late EAE, both DTI indices 
      were highly correlated with VEP amplitude (but not latency). CONCLUSION: DTI 
      measures FA and RD are associated to VEP latency in early stages of EAE but 
      associated to VEP amplitude in later stages, suggesting that the patterns of DTI 
      related to the functional decline may depend on the stage of disease progression.

AB  - AIM: To assess the diagnostic value of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and 
      fractional anisotropy (FA) of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at several anatomical 
      locations in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) to explore the optimal 
      parameters and measurement location. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was conducted 
      using the PubMed, EBSCO, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases to identify 
      articles relevant to this study published before September 2017. Studies were 
      selected and included according to strict eligibility criteria. Mean differences 
      (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare FA and ADC values 
      between CTS patients and healthy subjects. Potential publication bias was 
      investigated. RESULTS: Eleven studies involving 349 CTS wrists and 278 controls were 
      selected for the meta-analysis. A notable MD: was found for lowered FA at the level 
      of the pisiform bone for CTS versus controls (MD: -0.11, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: -1.14 to -0.07, z=5.83, p<0.001). A higher ADC was found at the pisiform bone 
      and hamate bone levels for CTS versus controls (P: MD: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.20, 
      z=5.98, p<0.001, H: MD: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.21, z=4.67, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The meta-analysis demonstrated a significant FA reduction and ADC increase in CTS 
      patients. This result supports the use of DTI parameters in differentiating CTS 
      patients from health subjects. The anatomical site for FA at the pisiform and ADC at 
      the pisiform and hamate levels were more accessible than other sites for the 
      diagnosis of CTS patients.

TI  - Neurophysiological assessment of trigeminal nerve reflexes in disorders of central 
      and peripheral nervous system.
PG  - 2255-65
AB  - The trigeminal nerve and nuclei (the trigeminal complex) are unique in the human 
      body with regard to their anatomical and physiological characteristics. They are 
      also special regarding the lesions in which they are involved, both at the 
      peripheral level because of the susceptibility of some terminal branches, and at the 
      nuclei because of their large size and the large amount of connections with other 
      centers. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging studies are often not sufficiently 
      informative to demonstrate very tiny lesions that could be responsible for an 
      important damage in the brainstem. Therefore, clinical neurophysiology and 
      specifically, the techniques used in the study of the trigeminal functions, remain 
      as convenient diagnostic and research tools to document clinically evident lesions 
      or uncover subclinical abnormalities. This review is focussed on the clinical 
      applicability of the study of trigeminal reflexes, including methods employed in the 
      documentation of focal lesions of peripheral branches, trigeminal involvement of 
      peripheral neuropathies, specific lesions of the trigeminal ganglia, central nervous 
      dysfunctions causing abnormalities in the excitability of trigeminal neurons, and 
      the possible use of trigeminal nerve reflexes in the study of facial pain syndromes 
      and headache.

AB  - Various neurological problems of the brain are known to occur in patients with end 
      stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) findings in patients with ESRD. Using DTI, we attempted to investigate DTI 
      findings in patients with ESRD who showed no specific lesions on conventional brain 
      MRI. We recruited 10 consecutive patients with ESRD for whom at least 3 years had 
      passed since the start of peritoneal dialysis and who showed no neurological 
      abnormality on neurologic examination. We excluded 6 patients who showed cerebral 
      infarct (4 patients) and diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy (2 patients); 
      finally, 4 patients (39.75 ± 9.84 years) were included in this study. We evaluated 
      hand motor function and cognition. DTI data were acquired using a 1.5-T Philips 
      Gyroscan Intera system and diffusion tensor tractographies (DTTs) for five neural 
      tracts (corticospinal tract, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior 
      longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus) were evaluated. 
      With the exception of 1 patient who revealed a mild abnormality at a higher 
      cognitive function, no abnormalities in motor and cognitive function were observed. 
      Among the 10 DTTs, except for those of the corticospinal tract, all 4 patients had 
      more than one lesion. Patients with ESRD showed abnormalities on DTTs that were 
      associated with cognition; however, they did not show significant cognitive 
      abnormalities.

PG  - 29-32

AB  - MRI may provide treatment outcome measures in neuromuscular conditions. The authors 
      assessed MRI magnetisation transfer ratios (MTRs) in lower-limb musculature as 
      markers of pathology in peripheral neuropathies and compared the findings with 
      associated clinical data. Ten patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A 
      (CMT1A) and nine patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy 
      (CIDP) were compared with 10 healthy subjects. The MTR in the calf muscles was 
      significantly lower than controls in the two patient groups (both p<0.001). The 
      median MTRs (IQR) were 50.5(1.6) percentage units (p.u.) (control), 41.5(10.6) p.u. 
      (CMT1A) and 39.3(8.7) p.u. (CIDP). Moreover, anterior lower leg MTR correlated 
      strongly with strength of ankle dorsiflexion, measured with the Medical Research 
      Council scale, in CIDP (ρ=0.88, p<0.001) and also in CMT1A (ρ=0.50, p<0.05), where 
      MTR also showed an association with disease duration (ρ=-0.86, p<0.001). Short tau 
      inversion recovery MRI of the same muscles showed abnormalities associated with 
      regions of reduced MTR (p<0.001), and MTR was also reduced in other muscles 
      otherwise deemed normal appearing (p<0.001), indicating that MTR may be more 
      sensitive to muscle damaged by denervation than conventional MRI. The significant 
      reductions in muscle MTR in peripheral neuropathies and the associated correlations 
      with clinical measures indicate that MTR has potential as an imaging outcome measure 
      in future therapeutic trials.

TI  - In vivo detection of nerve injury in familial amyloid polyneuropathy by magnetic 
      resonance neurography.
PG  - 549-62
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu344 [doi]
AB  - Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy is a rare, autosomal-dominant 
      inherited multisystem disorder usually manifesting with a rapidly progressive, 
      axonal, distally-symmetric polyneuropathy. The detection of nerve injury by nerve 
      conduction studies is limited, due to preferential involvement of small-fibres in 
      early stages. We investigated whether lower limb nerve-injury can be detected, 
      localized and quantified in vivo by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography. 
      We prospectively included 20 patients (12 male and eight female patients, mean age 
      47.9 years, range 26-66) with confirmed mutation in the transthyretin gene: 13 with 
      symptomatic polyneuropathy and seven asymptomatic gene carriers. A large age- and 
      sex-matched cohort of healthy volunteers served as controls (20 male and 20 female, 
      mean age 48.1 years, range 30-73). All patients received detailed neurological and 
      electrophysiological examinations and were scored using the Neuropathy Impairment 
      Score-Lower Limbs, Neuropathy Deficit and Neuropathy Symptom Score. Magnetic 
      resonance neurography (3 T) was performed with large longitudinal coverage from 
      proximal thigh to ankle-level and separately for each leg (140 axial slices/leg) by 
      using axial T2-weighted (repetition time/echo time = 5970/55 ms) and dual echo 
      (repetition time 5210 ms, echo times 12 and 73 ms) turbo spin echo 2D sequences with 
      spectral fat saturation. A 3D T2-weighted inversion-recovery sequence (repetition 
      time/echo time 3000/202 ms) was acquired for imaging of the spinal nerves and lumbar 
      plexus (50 axial slice reformations). Precise manual segmentation of the 
      spinal/sciatic/tibial/common peroneal nerves was performed on each slice. 
      Histogram-based normalization of nerve-voxel signal intensities was performed using 
      the age- and sex-matched control group as normative reference. Nerve-voxels were 
      subsequently classified as lesion-voxels if a threshold of >1.2 (normalized 
      signal-intensity) was exceeded. At distal thigh level, where a predominant 
      nerve-lesion-voxel burden was observed, signal quantification was performed by 
      calculating proton spin density and T2-relaxation time as microstructural markers of 
      nerve tissue integrity. The total number of nerve-lesion voxels (cumulated from 
      proximal-to-distal) was significantly higher in symptomatic patients (20 405 ± 1586) 
      versus asymptomatic gene carriers (12 294 ± 3199; P = 0.036) and versus controls 
      (6536 ± 467; P < 0.0001). It was also higher in asymptomatic carriers compared to 
      controls (P = 0.043). The number of nerve-lesion voxels was significantly higher at 
      thigh level compared to more distal levels (lower leg/ankle) of the lower 
      extremities (f-value = 279.22, P < 0.0001). Further signal-quantification at this 
      proximal site (thigh level) revealed a significant increase of proton-density (P < 
      0.0001) and T2-relaxation-time (P = 0.0011) in symptomatic patients, whereas 
      asymptomatic gene-carriers presented with a significant increase of proton-density 
      only. Lower limb nerve injury could be detected and quantified in vivo on 
      microstructural level by magnetic resonance neurography in symptomatic familial 
      amyloid polyneuropathy, and also in yet asymptomatic gene carriers, in whom imaging 
      detection precedes clinical and electrophysiological manifestation. Although 
      symptoms start and prevail distally, the focus of predominant nerve injury and 
      injury progression was found proximally at thigh level with strong and unambiguous 
      lesion-contrast. Imaging of proximal nerve lesions, which are difficult to detect by 
      nerve conduction studies, may have future implications also for other 
      distally-symmetric polyneuropathies.

AB  - CONCLUSIONS: The size of cochlear nerve (CN) is atrophic in adult auditory 
      neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) patients compared with non-ANSD sensorineural 
      hearing loss (SNHL) patients and normal hearing subjects, and CN deficiency is one 
      of the lesions for ANSD patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the dimensions of CN in 
      adult ANSD patients on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and confirm the hypothesis 
      that CN deficiency is one of the lesions for ANSD patients. METHODS: Medical records 
      and MRI of 24 adult ANSD patients reviewed retrospectively and 20 non-ANSD SNHL and 
      24 volunteers with normal hearing were recruited as control groups. The long 
      diameter (LD), short diameter (SD), and cross-sectional area (CSA) of CN and facial 
      nerve (FN) were measured. RESULTS: Among the 24 ANSD patients, this study was able 
      to reconstruct and measure the CN of 91.7% (22/24, total 43 ears) of patients and FN 
      of 83.3% (20/24, total 38 ears) of patients. The mean values and standard deviations 
      of LD, SD, and CSA of CN in ANSD patients were 0.65 ± 0.20 mm, 0.44 ± 0.15 mm, and 
      0.30 ± 0.19 mm(2), respectively. They were significantly smaller in ANSD patients 
      than in control groups (p < 0.001).

      peripheral nerve tumors and tumorlike lesions.

LID - 10.3171/2015.6.FOCUS15218 [doi]
AB  - The diagnostic workup and surgical therapy for peripheral nerve tumors and tumorlike 
      lesions are challenging. Magnetic resonance imaging is the standard diagnostic tool 
      in the preoperative workup. However, even with advanced pulse sequences such as 
      diffusion tensor imaging for MR neurography, the ability to differentiate tumor 
      entities based on histological features remains limited. In particular, rare tumor 
      entities different from schwannomas and neurofibromas are difficult to anticipate 
      before surgical exploration and histological confirmation. High-resolution 
      ultrasound (HRU) has become another important tool in the preoperative evaluation of 
      peripheral nerves. Ongoing software and technical developments with transducers of 
      up to 17-18 MHz enable high spatial resolution with tissue-differentiating 
      properties. Unfortunately, high-frequency ultrasound provides low tissue 
      penetration. The authors developed a setting in which intraoperative HRU was used 
      and in which the direct sterile contact between the ultrasound transducer and the 
      surgically exposed nerve pathology was enabled to increase structural resolution and 
      contrast. In a case-guided fashion, the authors report the sonographic 
      characteristics of rare tumor entities shown by intraoperative HRU and 
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the 
      clinical setting as a complementary tool to conventional MRI in the study and 
      assessment of the sciatic nerve and its pathologies. METHODS: 17 patients diagnosed 
      with different types of sciatic neuropathy and 10 healthy controls underwent a 
      conventional MRI and a DTI study in a 3-T MR scanner (Achieva(®) 3-T X-Series; 
      Philips Healthcare, Netherlands). RESULTS: In the control group, we were able to 
      track and visualize the common sciatic nerve and its main branches from hip to foot. 
      In the patient group, the affected sciatic nerves presented statistically 
      significant lower fractional anisotropy values and higher apparent diffusion 
      coefficient values when compared with controls, suggesting nerve damage. In all 
      cases, DTI offered complementary information for diagnosis and/or confirmation of 
      the suspected pathology. When compared with conventional MRI, DTI showed higher 
      sensitivity for nerve damage detection. CONCLUSION: DTI offers a significant 
      improvement and an important complement to visualize the sciatic nerve and its main 
      branches. In patients with sciatic nerve pathology DTI allows to a better detection 
      and characterization of the nerve damage. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: DTI enables in vivo 
      dissection of the sciatic nerve white matter fibres; its use offers a significant 
      improvement and complement to conventional MRI.

      measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) values. Five patients with bilateral 
      lumbar spinal stenosis showing unilateral neurological symptoms were examined using 
      TSE-DTI. In the spinal canal, FA values in the symptomatic side were lower than 
      those in the asymptomatic side. TSE-DTI using multipoint measurements of FA values 
      can differentiate the responsible lumbar nerve root.

TI  - Acute radial nerve entrapment at the spiral groove: detection by DTI-based 
      neurography.
PG  - 1678-83
LID - 10.1007/s00330-014-3562-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the potential of three-tesla diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) and tractography to detect changes of the radial (RN) and median (MN) 
      nerves during transient upper arm compression by a silicon ring tourniquet. METHODS: 
      Axial T2-weighted and DTI sequences (b = 700 s/mm(2), 16 gradient encoding 
      directions) of 13 healthy volunteers were obtained. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the MN and RN were measured at the 
      spiral groove and further visualized in 3D by deterministic tractography 
      (thresholds: FA = .15, angle change = 27°). RESULTS: Local/lesional RN FA values 
      increased (p = 0.001) and ADC values decreased (p = 0.02) during a 20-min upper arm 
      compression, whereas no significant FA (p = 0.49) or ADC (p = 0.73) changes of the 
      MN were detected. There were no T2-w nerve signal changes or alterations of nerve 
      trajectories in 3D. CONCLUSIONS: Acute nerve compression of the RN leads to changes 
      of its three-tesla DTI metrics. Peripheral nerve DTI provides non-invasive insights 
      into the "selective" vulnerability of the RN at the spiral groove. KEY POINTS: • 
      DTI-based neurography detects nerve changes during acute nerve compression. • 
      Compression leads to a transient increase in local radial nerve FA values. • DTI 
      provides insights into radial nerve vulnerability at the spiral groove.

      integrity following decompression surgery associated with improvements in clinical 
      symptoms: A case report.

AB  - The outcomes from spinal nerve decompression surgery are highly variable with a 
      sizable proportion of elderly foraminal stenosis patients not regaining good pain 
      relief. A better understanding of nerve root compression before and following 
      decompression surgery and whether these changes are mirrored by improvements in 
      symptoms may help to improve clinical decision-making processes. This case study 
      used a combination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), clinical questionnaires and 
      motor neurophysiology assessments before and up to 3 months following spinal 
      decompression surgery. In this case report, a 70-year-old women with compression of 
      the left L5 spinal nerve root in the L5-S1 exit foramina was recruited to the study. 
      At 3 months following surgery, DTI revealed marked improvements in left L5 
      microstructural integrity to a similar level to that seen in the intact right L5 
      nerve root. This was accompanied by a gradual improvement in pain-related symptoms, 
      mood and disability score by 3 months. Using this novel multimodal approach, it may 
      be possible to track concurrent improvements in pain-related symptoms, function and 
      microstructural integrity of compressed nerves in elderly foraminal stenosis 
      patients undergoing decompression surgery.

TI  - MRI-based 3D pelvic autonomous innervation: a first step towards image-guided pelvic 
      surgery.
PG  - 1989-97
LID - 10.1007/s00330-014-3211-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse pelvic autonomous innervation with magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) in comparison with anatomical macroscopic dissection on cadavers. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Pelvic MRI was performed in eight adult human cadavers (five men and three 
      women) using a total of four sequences each: T1, T1 fat saturation, T2, diffusion 
      weighed. Images were analysed with segmentation software in order to extract nervous 
      tissue. Key height points of the pelvis autonomous innervation were located in every 
      specimen. Standardised pelvis dissections were then performed. Distances between the 
      same key points and the three anatomical references forming a coordinate system were 
      measured on MRIs and dissections. Concordance (Lin's concordance correlation 
      coefficient) between MRI and dissection was calculated. RESULTS: MRI acquisition 
      allowed an adequate visualization of the autonomous innervation. Comparison between 
      3D MRI images and dissection showed concordant pictures. The statistical analysis 
      showed a mean difference of less than 1 cm between MRI and dissection measures and a 
      correct concordance correlation coefficient on at least two coordinates for each 
      point. CONCLUSION: Our acquisition and post-processing method demonstrated that MRI 
      is suitable for detection of autonomous pelvic innervations and can offer a 
      preoperative nerve cartography. KEY POINTS: • Nerve preservation is a hot topic in 
      pelvic surgery • High resolution MRI can show distal peripheral nerves • 
      Anatomo-radiological comparison shows good correlation between MRI and dissection • 
      3D reconstructions of pelvic innervation were obtained with an original method • 
      This is a first step towards image-guided pelvic surgery.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of the inferior alveolar nerve using 3T MRI: a study for 
      quantitative evaluation and fibre tracking.
PG  - 20160200
LID - 20160200
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can provide structural information and 
      objective values for nerves. The aims of this study were to perform quantitative 
      evaluation and fibre tracking of the normal inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) using DTI 
      on 3.0-T MRI. METHODS: DTI was applied to 92 IANs of 46 healthy volunteers. Circular 
      regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on three different positions at the 
      mandibular foramen, second molar and mental foramen of each nerve on apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and the ADC and FA 
      of each ROI were measured. Differences in the values arising from the nerve 
      positions were evaluated. Furthermore, fibre tracking of the IANs was performed by 
      tractography, and the quality of visualization was evaluated. RESULTS: There were no 
      significant differences in the ADC and FA between the right and left sides 
      regardless of the anteroposterior positions. Regarding differences arising from the 
      anteroposterior measurement positions, the ADC and FA showed no significant 
      differences (p > 0.017), except for the ADCs between the positions at the mandibular 
      foramen and mental foramen in the left side (p = 0.0068). Overall, 70 (76%) of the 
      92 IANs could be visualized fully or partially by tractography. CONCLUSIONS: The ADC 
      and FA of the IAN were successfully obtained from healthy volunteers using DTI and 
      were confirmed to be symmetrical regardless of the measurement positions. DTI is a 
      feasible technique for the quantitative evaluation and visualization of the IAN.

TI  - Novel flexible nerve conduits made of water-based biodegradable polyurethane for 
      peripheral nerve regeneration.
PG  - 1383-1392
LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.36022 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral nerve conduits were fabricated from biodegradable polyurethane (PU) which 
      was synthesized by a waterborne process. The biodegradable PU was based on 
      poly(ε-caprolactone) diol and polyethylene butylene adipate diol (2:3 molar ratio) 
      as the soft segment. Conduits formed by the freeze-drying process had asymmetric 
      microporous structure. The PU nerve conduits were used to bridge a 10-mm gap in rat 
      sciatic nerve. Nerve regeneration was evaluated by walking track analysis, magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI), electrophysiological, and histological analyses. Results 
      demonstrated that after 6 weeks, walking function was recovered by 40%. MR images 
      showed that the transected nerve was reconnected after 3 weeks and the diameter of 
      the regenerated nerve increased from 3 to 6 weeks. The nerve conduction velocity of 
      the regenerated nerve reached 50% of the normal value after 6 weeks. Histological 
      examination revealed that the cross-sectional area of the regenerated nerve at the 
      midconduit was 0.24 mm(2) after 6 weeks. The efficacy of PU nerve conduits based on 
      functional recovery and histology was superior to that of commercial conduits 
      (Neurotube). The PU nerve conduit developed in this study may be a potential 
      candidate for clinical peripheral nerve tissue engineering. © 2017 Wiley

TI  - Real-time cardiovascular magnetic resonance at high temporal resolution: radial 
      FLASH with nonlinear inverse reconstruction.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/1532-429X-12-39 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional assessments of the heart by dynamic cardiovascular magnetic 
      resonance (CMR) commonly rely on (i) electrocardiographic (ECG) gating yielding 
      pseudo real-time cine representations, (ii) balanced gradient-echo sequences 
      referred to as steady-state free precession (SSFP), and (iii) breath holding or 
      respiratory gating. Problems may therefore be due to the need for a robust ECG 
      signal, the occurrence of arrhythmia and beat to beat variations, technical 
      instabilities (e.g., SSFP "banding" artefacts), and limited patient compliance and 
      comfort. Here we describe a new approach providing true real-time CMR with image 
      acquisition times as short as 20 to 30 ms or rates of 30 to 50 frames per second. 
      METHODS: The approach relies on a previously developed real-time MR method, which 
      combines a strongly undersampled radial FLASH CMR sequence with image reconstruction 
      by regularized nonlinear inversion. While iterative reconstructions are currently 
      performed offline due to limited computer speed, online monitoring during scanning 
      is accomplished using gridding reconstructions with a sliding window at the same 
      frame rate but with lower image quality. RESULTS: Scans of healthy young subjects 
      were performed at 3 T without ECG gating and during free breathing. The resulting 
      images yield T1 contrast (depending on flip angle) with an opposed-phase or in-phase 
      condition for water and fat signals (depending on echo time). They completely avoid 
      (i) susceptibility-induced artefacts due to the very short echo times, (ii) 
      radiofrequency power limitations due to excitations with flip angles of 10 degrees 
      or less, and (iii) the risk of peripheral nerve stimulation due to the use of normal 
      gradient switching modes. For a section thickness of 8 mm, real-time images offer a 
      spatial resolution and total acquisition time of 1.5 mm at 30 ms and 2.0 mm at 22 
      ms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Though awaiting thorough clinical evaluation, this 
      work describes a robust and flexible acquisition and reconstruction technique for 
      real-time CMR at the ultimate limit of this technology.

PG  - 408-14
LID - 10.3171/2014.4.JNS13940 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Extraspinal sciatica can present unique challenges in clinical diagnosis and 
      management. In this study, the authors evaluated qualitative and quantitative 
      patterns of sciatica-related pathology at the ischial tuberosity on MR neurography 
      (MRN) studies performed for chronic extraspinal sciatica. METHODS: Lumbosacral MRN 
      studies obtained in 14 patients at the University of California, San Francisco 
      between 2007 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients had been referred 
      by neurosurgeons or neurologists for chronic unilateral sciatica (≥ 3 months), and 
      the MRN reports described asymmetrical increased T2 signal within the sciatic nerve 
      at the level of the ischial tuberosity. MRN studies were also performed 
      prospectively in 6 healthy volunteers. Sciatic nerve T2 signal intensity (SI) and 
      cross-sectional area at the ischial tuberosity were calculated and compared between 
      the 2 sides in all 20 subjects. The same measurements were also performed at the 
      sciatic notch as an internal reference. Adjacent musculoskeletal pathology was 
      compared between the 2 sides in all subjects. RESULTS: Seven of the 9 patients for 
      whom detailed histories were available had a specific history of injury or trauma 
      near the proximal hamstring preceding the onset of sciatica. Eight of the 14 
      patients also demonstrated soft-tissue abnormalities adjacent to the proximal 
      hamstring origin. The remaining 6 had normal muscles, tendons, and marrow in the 
      region of the ischial tuberosity. There was a significant difference in sciatic 
      nerve SI and size between the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides at the level of the 
      ischial tuberosity, with a mean adjusted SI of 1.38 compared with 1.00 (p < 0.001) 
      and a mean cross-sectional nerve area of 0.66 versus 0.54 cm(2) (p = 0.002). The 
      control group demonstrated symmetrical adjusted SI and sciatic nerve size. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that chronic sciatic neuropathy can be seen at the 
      ischial tuberosity in the setting of prior proximal hamstring tendon injury or 
      adjacent soft-tissue abnormalities. Because hamstring tendon injury as a cause of 
      chronic sciatica remains a diagnosis of exclusion, this distinct category of 
      patients has not been described in the radiographic literature and merits special 
      attention from clinicians and radiologists in the management of extraspinal 
      sciatica. Magnetic resonance neurography is useful for evaluating chronic sciatic 
      neuropathy both qualitatively and quantitatively, particularly in patients for whom 
      electromyography and traditional MRI studies are unrevealing.

TI  - The diagnosis of double-crush lesion in the L5 lumbar nerve using diffusion tensor 
      imaging.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A double-crush lesion is a condition in which the lumbar nerve 
      is compressed both medially and laterally in the spinal canal, where diagnosis can 
      be very difficult, and is a factor leading to poor surgical success rates. PURPOSE: 
      Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to determine DTI parameter fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) values and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in both intraspinal 
      column lesions alone and in double-crush lesions. STUDY DESIGN: This study used a 
      prospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Of the 56 cases (mean age: 72.2 years) that 
      underwent laminectomy for lumbar spinal stenosis at our clinic between April 2013 to 
      March, 2015, 10 cases with L5 radiculopathy caused by L4-L5 stenosis (Intraspinal 
      stenosis group (Group I); mean age: 74.7 years), and 5 cases with persistent 
      symptoms caused by L5 foraminal stenosis despite L4-L5 decompression surgery 
      (Double-crush group (Group D); mean age: 77.6 years) were targeted. One patient in 
      Group D was diagnosed through microendoscopic intrapedicular partial pediculotomy 
      and the remaining four cases by nerve root infiltration. Five healthy cases (mean 
      age: 54 years) were studied as controls. OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraspinal zone (Iz), 
      nerve root (N), and extraforaminal zone (Ez) were established as the regions of 
      interest, and the L5 nerve FA and ADC values were determined on the affected side. 
      METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging was performed prospectively by 1.5T magnetic 
      resonance imaging before surgery, and DTI parameters of L5 nerve were evaluated in 
      all patients and healthy volunteers. Student t test was used for group comparisons, 
      and a p<.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy 
      values (Iz, N, Ez) were 0.415, 0.448, and 0.517, respectively, increasing as sites 
      became more distal. Group I values were 0.335, 0.393, and 0.484, and Group D values 
      were 0.296, 0.367, and 0.360. Compared with the healthy volunteers, Group D had 
      significantly lower Iz (p<.05) and Ez (p<.001) values, while Group I had 
      significantly lower Iz (p<.05) values. In Group D, Ez FA values were significantly 
      lower (p<.001) than in Group I. Apparent diffusion coefficient values (Iz, N, Ez) in 
      the healthy control group were 1.270 mm2/s, 1.151 mm2/s, and 0.937 mm2/s with values 
      decreasing as sites grew distal. In Group I, the ADC values were 1.406 mm2/s, 
      1.184 mm2/s, and 1.001 mm2/s, while in Group D they were 1.551 mm2/s, 1.412 mm2/s, 
      and 1.329 mm2/s. Compared with the healthy volunteers, Iz (p<.05) and Ez (p<.05) 
      values were significantly higher in Group D. The N (p<.01) and Ez (p<.001) ADC 
      values were significantly higher in Group D than in Group I. CONCLUSIONS: Depending 
      on where the nerve was compressed, changes in DTI parameters revealed nerve damage 
      (low FA values and increased ADC) in the intraspinal canal in the Intraspinal Group, 
      and over a widespread area in the Double-crush Group spanning the medial to lateral 
      spinal canal. Our research suggests that in cases where double crush is suspected 
      before surgery, failed back surgery syndrome may be prevented by evaluating DTI 
      images.

TI  - Visualization of lumbar nerves using reduced field of view diffusion tensor imaging

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of lumbar 
      nerves with reduced field of view (rFOV) using 3 T MRI. METHODS: DTI measured with 
      rFOV was compared with conventional FOV (cFOV) 3.0 T MRI in 5 healthy volunteers and 
      10 patients with degenerative lumbar disorders. The intracanal, foramina and 
      extraforamina of the L5 nerve were established as the regions of interest and 
      fractional anisotropy (FA) values and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values 
      were measured. Image quality for tractography and FA maps and ADC maps, 
      interindividual and intraindividual reliability of FA and ADC, and 
      signal-to-noise (SNR) were studied. RESULTS: Both of image qualities with 
      tractography, FA map and ADC map showed that lumbar nerves were more clearly imaged 
      with the rFOV. Intraindividual reliability was higher with rFOV compared with the 
      conventional method for ADC values, while interindividual reliability was higher for 
      both FA values and ADC values with the rFOV method over the conventional method (p < 
      0.05). Significantly higher SNR was obtained with rFOV compared with cFOV in the 
      spinal canal (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: rFOV enabled clearer imaging of the lumbar 
      nerve, allowing for more accurate measurement of FA and ADC values. Significantly 
      higher SNR was obtained with rFOV compared with cFOV in the spinal canal. To our 
      knowledge, this research showed for the first time the usefulness of rFOV in 
      patients with degenerative lumbar disorders. High resolution DTI using rFOV may 
      become useful in clinical applications because visualization of nerve entrapments 
      and quantification of DTI parameters may allow more accurate diagnoses of lumbar 
      nerve dysfunction. Advances in knowledge: Compared with traditional methods, rFOV 
      allows for clear imaging of the lumbar nerve and enables accurate measurements of 
      the FA and ADC values. High-resolution DTI with rFOV may be used to visualize nerve 
      entrapments and allow for more accurate diagnosis of DTI parameter quantification 
      with opportunities for clinical applications.

TI  - Peripheral nerve tractography in soft tissue tumors: a preliminary 3-tesla diffusion 
      tensor magnetic resonance imaging study.
PG  - 338-45
LID - 10.1002/mus.24313 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) study aimed to 
      clarify the relationship of peripheral nerves and soft tissue tumors (STTs) in 3D to 
      optimize subsequent treatment. METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive STT patients 
      (histologically malignant, n=10; intermediate, n=3; and benign, n=13) underwent 
      3-Tesla MRI using an echoplanar DTI sequence. Deterministic tractography was 
      performed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured within peritumoral and 
      distant regions of interest. RESULTS: Tractography depicted the 3D course of the 
      sciatic (n=12), femoral (n=2), tibial (n=7), fibular (n=2), median (n=1), 
      musculocutaneous (n=1), and ulnar (n=1) nerves in a regular (n=8 of 18, 44.4%) or 
      thinned (n=7 of 18, 38.9%) fashion. The lowest peritumoral FA values, abrupt 
      thinning, and/or complete discontinuity of trajectories were found in 2 cases with 
      histologically proven tumoral nerve infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: DTI clarifies the 3D 
      topography between major peripheral nerves and STTs and may be helpful in the 
      assessment of peripheral nerve infiltration by malignant tumors.

TI  - Sonography of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve with magnetic resonance 
      imaging and anatomic correlation.
PG  - 1475-83
LID - 10.7863/ultra.33.8.1475 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Abnormalities of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LABCN) are 
      associated with antecubital elbow conditions, such as distal biceps brachii tendon 
      tears and traumatic cephalic vein phlebotomy. These can lead to lateral forearm, 
      elbow, and wrist symptoms that can mimic other disease processes. The purpose of 
      this study was to characterize the sonographic appearance of the LABCN using 
      cadaveric dissection and retrospective analysis of sonographic examinations of 
      symptomatic patients with magnetic resonance imaging correlation. METHODS: For the 
      first part of this study, a cadaveric elbow specimen was examined, and sonography 
      was performed after dissection to identify the LABCN. Subsequently, 26 elbows in 13 
      patients with LABCN abnormalities were identified with sonography and 
      retrospectively evaluated to characterize the appearance of the LABCN in both 
      symptomatic and asymptomatic elbows. RESULTS: The symptomatic LABCNs showed fusiform 
      enlargement, increased echogenicity, and loss of the normal fascicular echo texture. 
      The mean cross-sectional area of the symptomatic nerves was 12.0 mm(2) (range, 
      6.1-17.2 mm(2)), with a maximum thickness of 3.5 mm (range, 2.3-5.9 mm), compared to 
      3.3 mm(2) (range, 1.9-5.2 mm(2)), with a maximum thickness of 1.3 mm (range, 0.9-2.2 
      mm), in the contralateral normal elbows. CONCLUSIONS: The close proximity of the 
      LABCN to the distal biceps tendon and the cephalic vein makes it vulnerable to 
      compression and injury in the setting of distal biceps tendon tears and traumatic 
      phlebotomy, which may cause nerve enlargement and increased echogenicity. Awareness 
      of the location and appearance of the LABCN on sonography is important for 
      determining potential causes of lateral elbow and forearm pain.

AB  - To investigate the microstructural changes in compressed nerves using diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) of herniated disc treated with percutaneous transforaminal 
      endoscopic discectomy.Diffusion tensor imaging has been widely used to visualize 
      peripheral nerves, and the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed 
      using DTI. However, the microstructural changes after surgery are not 
      well-understood in patients with lumbar disc herniation.Thirty-four consecutive 
      patients with foraminal disc herniation affecting unilateral sacral 1 (S1) nerve 
      roots were enrolled in this study. DTI with tractography was performed on S1 nerve 
      roots before and after surgery. The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent 
      diffusion coefficient values were calculated from tractography images.In compressed 
      nerve roots, the FA value before surgery was significantly lower than that after 
      surgery (P = 0.000). A significant difference in FA values was found between the 
      compressed and normal sides before surgery (P = 0.000). However, no significant 
      difference was found between the compressed and normal sides after surgery 
      (P = 0.057). A significant difference in apparent diffusion coefficient values was 
      found before and after surgery at the compressed side (P = 0.023). However, no 
      significant difference was found between the compressed and normal sides after 
      surgery (P = 0.203).We show that the diffusion parameters of compressed nerve roots 
      were not significantly different before and after percutaneous transforaminal 
      endoscopic discectomy, indicating that the microstructure of the nerve root 
      recovered after surgery.

      restricted cortical damage.

AB  - SPG11 mutations are the major cause of autosomal recessive Hereditary Spastic 
      Paraplegia. The disease has a wide phenotypic variability indicating many regions of 
      the nervous system besides the corticospinal tract are affected. Despite this, 
      anatomical and phenotypic characterization is restricted. In the present study, we 
      investigate the anatomical abnormalities related to SPG11 mutations and how they 
      relate to clinical and cognitive measures. Moreover, we aim to depict how the 
      disease course influences the regions affected, unraveling different susceptibility 
      of specific neuronal populations. We performed clinical and paraclinical studies 
      encompassing neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological tools in a 
      cohort of twenty-five patients and age matched controls. We assessed cortical 
      thickness (FreeSurfer software), deep grey matter volumes (T1-MultiAtlas tool), 
      white matter microstructural damage (DTI-MultiAtlas) and spinal cord morphometry 
      (Spineseg software) on a 3 T MRI scan. Mean age and disease duration were 29 and 
      13.2 years respectively. Sixty-four percent of the patients were wheelchair bound 
      while 84% were demented. We were able to unfold a diffuse pattern of white matter 
      integrity loss as well as basal ganglia and spinal cord atrophy. Such findings 
      contrasted with a restricted pattern of cortical thinning (motor, limbic and 
      parietal cortices). Electromyography revealed motor neuronopathy affecting 96% of 
      the probands. Correlations with disease duration pointed towards a progressive 
      degeneration of multiple grey matter structures and spinal cord, but not of the 
      white matter. SPG11-related hereditary spastic paraplegia is characterized by 
      selective neuronal vulnerability, in which a precocious and widespread white matter 
      involvement is later followed by a restricted but clearly progressive grey matter 
      degeneration.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used in the study of the central nervous 
      system. DTI represents a potential diagnostic tool for the peripheral nerve. 
      However, more detailed information is needed for application of DTI in the clinical 
      setting. In this study, peripheral degeneration and regeneration were evaluated 
      using DTI-based analyses in a rabbit model. The changes in DTI parameters were 
      compared to histological and functional changes after nerve injury. We used a high 
      magnetic field (7.04T) MRI system. Japanese white male rabbits were used as the 
      model of sciatic nerve crush injury. MR images were obtained before injury and at 2, 
      4, 6 and 8 weeks post-injury. The DTI parameters of fractional anisotropy (FA), 
      axial diffusivity (λ||), and radial diffusivity (λ⊥) were calculated. Our results 
      showed decreased FA and increased λ⊥ during the degenerative phase after sciatic 
      nerve injury. In contrast, increased FA and decreased λ⊥ were observed during the 
      regenerative phase. FA changes were correlated with axon number and with motor 
      function recovery, assessed with the toe-spreading index. This study clearly 
      demonstrates the validity of applying DTI parameters to the in vivo evaluation of 
      peripheral nerve regeneration. Furthermore, results suggest that DTI can be a potent 
      tool for predicting the extent of functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury.

TI  - Injury of Corticospinal tract and Corticoreticular pathway caused by high-voltage 
      electrical shock: a case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We imaged the corticospinal tract (CST) and corticoreticular pathway 
      (CRP) using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) to evaluate the cause of muscle 
      weakness in a patient who was exposed to high-voltage electricity. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old man presented with quadriparesis after high-voltage 
      electrical shock from power lines while working about 5.8 years ago. The electrical 
      current entered through the left hand and exited through the occipital area of the 
      head. The degree of weakness on bilateral upper and lower extremities was 3-4 on the 
      Medical Research Council strength scale. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was 
      performed 5.8 years after onset. The CST and CRP were depicted by placing two 
      regions of interest for each neural tract on the two-dimensional fractional 
      anisotropy color map. DTT of the DTI scan showed that the bilateral CST and CRP were 
      thinned compared to those of the healthy control subject. On the nerve conduction 
      test, abnormal findings suggesting peripheral nerve lesion were not observed. 
      Therefore, injury of bilateral CST and CRP seems to have contributed to our 
      patient's weakness after the electrical shock. CONCLUSION: Depiction of neural 
      tracts in the brain using DTT can assist in the accurate and detailed evaluation of 
      the cause of neural deficit after electrical injury.

TI  - Size of the intracranial optic nerve and optic tract in neonates at term-equivalent 
      age at magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 527-33
LID - 10.1007/s00247-015-3495-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The expected MRI-based dimensions of the intracranial optic nerve and 
      optic tract in neonates are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sizes of the 
      intracranial optic nerve and optic tract in neonates at term-equivalent age using 
      MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed brain MRI examinations in 62 
      infants (28 boys) without intracranial abnormalities. The images were obtained in 
      infants at term-equivalent age with a 1.5-tesla MRI scanner. We measured the widths 
      and heights of the intracranial optic nerve and optic tract and calculated the 
      cross-sectional areas using the formula for an ellipse. RESULTS: The means ± 
      standard deviation of the width, height and cross-sectional area of the intracranial 
      optic nerve were 2.7 ± 0.2 mm, 1.7 ± 0.2 mm and 3.5 ± 0.5 mm(2), respectively. The 
      width, height and cross-sectional area of the optic tract were 1.5 ± 0.1 mm, 
      1.6 ± 0.1 mm and 2.0 ± 0.2 mm(2), respectively. Using univariate and multivariate 
      analyses, we found that postmenstrual age showed independent intermediate positive 
      correlations with the width (r = 0.48, P < 0.01) and cross-sectional area (r = 0.40, 
      P < 0.01) of the intracranial optic nerve. The lower bounds of the 95% prediction 
      intervals for the width and cross-sectional area of the intracranial optic nerve 
      were 0.07 × (postmenstrual age in weeks) - 0.46 mm, and 0.17 × (postmenstrual age in 
      weeks) - 4.0 mm(2), respectively. CONCLUSION: We identified the sizes of the 
      intracranial optic nerve and optic tract in neonates at term-equivalent age. The 
      postmenstrual age at MRI independently positively correlated with the sizes.

TI  - Immediate Enhancement of Nerve Function Using a Novel Axonal Fusion Device After 
      Neurotmesis.
PG  - 590-599
LID - 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001242 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of peripheral nerve injuries remains a large challenge 
      for plastic surgeons. With the inability to fuse axonal endings, results after 
      microsurgical nerve repair have been inconsistent. Our current nerve repair 
      strategies rely upon the slow and lengthy process of axonal regeneration (~1 mm/d). 
      Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been investigated as a potential axonal fusion agent; 
      however, the percentage of axonal fusion has been inconsistent. The purpose of this 
      study was to identify a PEG delivery device to standardize outcomes after attempted 
      axonal fusion with PEG. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a rat sciatic nerve injury 
      model in which we completely transected and repaired the left sciatic nerve to 
      evaluate the efficacy of PEG fusion over a span of 12 weeks. In addition, we 
      evaluated the effectiveness of a delivery device's ability to optimize results after 
      PEG fusion. RESULTS: We found that PEG rapidly (within minutes) restores axonal 
      continuity as assessed by electrophysiology, fluorescent retrograde tracer, and 
      diffusion tensor imaging. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that motor axon counts 
      are significantly increased at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks postoperatively in 
      PEG-treated animals. Furthermore, PEG restored behavioral functions up to 50% 
      compared with animals that received the criterion standard epineurial repair 
      (control animals). CONCLUSIONS: The ability of PEG to rapidly restore nerve function 
      after neurotmesis could have vast implications on the clinical management of 
      traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging can be used to detect lesions in peripheral nerves in 
      patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy treated with 
      subcutaneous immunoglobulin.
PG  - 745-52
LID - 10.1007/s00234-016-1692-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      has shown that fractional anisotropy (FA) is lower in peripheral nerves in chronic 
      inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We examined whether DTI correlates 
      to muscle strength or impairment. METHODS: MRI of sciatic and tibial nerves was 
      performed on 3-T MR scanner by obtaining T2- and DTI-weighted sequences with fat 
      saturation. On each slice of T2-weighted (T2w) and DTI, the tibial and sciatic 
      nerves were segmented and served for calculation of signal intensity. On DTI images, 
      pixel-by-pixel calculation of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was done. 
      Muscle strength at knee and ankle was determined by isokinetic dynamometry and 
      severity of CIDP by neuropathy impairment score (NIS). RESULTS: Fourteen CIDP 
      patients treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin were compared to gender- and 
      age-matched controls. T2w values expressed as a nerve/muscle ratio (nT2w) were 
      unchanged in CIDP versus controls 0.93 ± 0.21 versus 1.02 ± 0.21 (P = 0.10). FA 
      values were lower in CIDP compared to controls 0.38 ± 0.07 versus 0.45 ± 0.05 
      (P < 0.0001), and ADC values were higher in CIDP versus controls 1735 ± 232 versus 
      1593 ± 116 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s (P = 0.005). In CIDP, FA values correlated to clinical 
      impairment (NIS) (r = -0.57, P = 0.03), but not to muscle strength. FA value in the 
      sciatic nerve distinguishes CIDP from controls with a sensitivity and a specificity 
      of 92.9 %. CONCLUSION: CIDP patients have unchanged nT2w values, lower FA values, 
      and higher ADC values of sciatic and tibial nerves compared to controls. FA values 
      correlated to NIS but were unrelated to muscle strength. DTI of sciatic nerves seems 
      promising to differentiate CIDP from controls.

TI  - Sonographic evaluation of sciatic nerves in patients with unilateral sciatica.
PG  - 1598-602
LID - 10.1016/j.apmr.2012.03.013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sciatic nerves of patients with unilateral sciatica by 
      using an ultrasound, and to determine whether ultrasonographic findings were related 
      to clinical and electrophysiologic parameters. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. 
      SETTING: Physical medicine and rehabilitation departments of a university hospital 
      and a rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (N=30; 10 men, 20 
      women) with complaints of low back pain and unilateral sciatica of more than 1 month 
      of duration were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All 
      patients underwent a substantial clinical assessment, and they were also evaluated 
      by electromyogram and magnetic resonance imaging. Pain was evaluated by a visual 
      analog scale and the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) 
      Scale. A linear array probe (7.5-12MHz) was used to scan sciatic nerves bilaterally 
      in the prone position. Sciatic nerve diameters-thickness (short axis) and width 
      (long axis)-and cross-sectional areas were measured bilaterally at the same levels, 
      proximal to the bifurcation and midthigh. The values pertaining to the unaffected 
      limbs were taken as controls. RESULTS: When compared with the unaffected sides, mean 
      values for sciatic nerve measurements-long axis at bifurcation level (P=.017) and 
      cross-sectional area at midthigh level (P=.005)-were significantly larger on the 
      affected sides. Swelling ratios negatively correlated with symptom duration 
      (r=-.394, P=.038) and LANSS scores (r=-.451, P=.016) at only midthigh level. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Sciatic nerves seem to be enlarged on the side of sciatica in patients 
      with low back pain. Our preliminary results may provide insight into better 
      understanding the lower limb radiating pain in this group of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with cervical compression myelopathy (CCM) generally present 
      bilateral neurological symptoms in their extremities. However, a substantial portion 
      of patients with CCM exhibit laterality of neurological symptoms. The aim of this 
      study was to assess the correlation between intrinsic structural damage and 
      laterality of symptoms using spinal cord diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the 
      corticospinal tract. METHODS: We enrolled 10 healthy volunteers and 40 patients with 
      CCM in this study. We evaluated motor function using the American Spinal Injury 
      Association (ASIA) motor score for left and right extremities. For DTI acquisitions, 
      a 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging system with diffusion-weighted spin-echo sequence 
      was used. Regions-of-interest in the lateral column tracts were determined. We 
      determined the correlations between fractional anisotropy (FA) and ASIA motor 
      scores. An FA asymmetry index was calculated using left and right 
      regions-of-interest. RESULTS: Four patients exhibited laterality of symptoms in 
      their extremities, for which left and right ASIA scores correlated moderately with 
      FA in the left and right lateral columns, respectively (left: ρ = 0.64, P < 0.001; 
      right: ρ = 0.67, P < 0.001). The area under the receiver-operator characteristic 
      curve showed that the FA asymmetry index indicated laterality of symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using tract-specific DTI, we demonstrated that microstructural damages 
      in the left and right corticospinal tracts correlated with corresponding 
      neurological symptoms in the ipsilateral side and the FA asymmetry index could 
      indicate laterality in neurological symptoms of patients with CCM.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of surgery on the optic pathway of patients with 
      intra- or parasellar mass lesions, as evidenced by readout-segmented DTI. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with intra- or parasellar mass lesions were 
      included in the study. Readout-segmented DTI and T2WI were obtained before and after 
      surgery. The ROIs were set on the optic chiasm as well as the anterior and posterior 
      optic tracts. For each ROI, axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), 
      fractional anisotropy (FA), and ADC values were calculated. DTI parameters in 
      preoperative studies of all patients were compared and related to the presence of 
      tumor compression. In patients who underwent surgery, pre- and postoperative DTI 
      parameters were compared. The correlation between DTI parameters and visual function 
      was determined. RESULTS: In the preoperative studies, the optic chiasm of patients 
      with tumor compression showed significant lower AD and RD values. The optic chiasm 
      of patients with visual field disorder showed significantly lower AD and RD values 
      compared to patients without the disorder. There was a negative correlation with a 
      trend toward significance between FA values and visual field disorder scores. The 
      comparative analysis of patients in pre- and postoperative studies showed that the 
      optic chiasm of patients with tumor compression presented a significant lower FA 
      (0.41 versus 0.30, p=0.0068) and higher RD values after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: DTI is 
      a useful tool to assess the impact of surgery on the optic chiasm and nerve.

TI  - Primary somatosensory/motor cortical thickness distinguishes paresthesia-dominant 
      from pain-dominant carpal tunnel syndrome.
PG  - 1085-1093
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000486 [doi]
AB  - Paresthesia-dominant and pain-dominant subgroups have been noted in carpal tunnel 
      syndrome (CTS), a peripheral neuropathic disorder characterized by altered primary 
      somatosensory/motor (S1/M1) physiology. We aimed to investigate whether brain 
      morphometry dissociates these subgroups. Subjects with CTS were evaluated with nerve 
      conduction studies, whereas symptom severity ratings were used to allocate subjects 
      into paresthesia-dominant (CTS-paresthesia), pain-dominant (CTS-pain), and 
      pain/paresthesia nondominant (not included in further analysis) subgroups. 
      Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at 3T using a 
      multiecho MPRAGE T1-weighted pulse sequence, and gray matter cortical thickness was 
      calculated across the entire brain using validated, automated methods. 
      CTS-paresthesia subjects demonstrated reduced median sensory nerve conduction 
      velocity (P = 0.05) compared with CTS-pain subjects. In addition, cortical thickness 
      in precentral and postcentral gyri (S1/M1 hand area) contralateral to the more 
      affected hand was significantly reduced in CTS-paresthesia subgroup compared with 
      CTS-pain subgroup. Moreover, in CTS-paresthesia subjects, precentral cortical 
      thickness was negatively correlated with paresthesia severity (r(34) = -0.40, P = 
      0.016) and positively correlated with median nerve sensory velocity (r(36) = 0.51, P 
      = 0.001), but not with pain severity. Conversely, in CTS-pain subjects, 
      contralesional S1 (r(9) = 0.62, P = 0.042) and M1 (r(9) = 0.61, P = 0.046) cortical 
      thickness were correlated with pain severity, but not median nerve velocity or 
      paresthesia severity. This double dissociation in somatotopically specific S1/M1 
      areas suggests a neuroanatomical substrate for symptom-based CTS subgroups. Such 
      fine-grained subgrouping of CTS may lead to improved personalized therapeutic 
      approaches, based on superior characterization of the linkage between peripheral and 
      central neuroplasticity.

AB  - Successful management of peripheral nerve trauma relies on accurate localization of 
      the injury and grading of the severity of nerve injury to determine whether surgical 
      intervention is required. Existing techniques, such as electrodiagnostic studies and 
      conventional imaging modalities, provide important information, but are limited by 
      being unable to distinguish severe nerve lesions in continuity that will recover 
      from those that will not. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of 
      peripheral nerves provide a novel technique to localize and grade nerve injury, by 
      assessing the integrity of the nerve fibers across the site of nerve injury. 
      Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography also hold promise as markers of early 
      nerve regeneration, prior to clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of recovery. In 
      the present review, the techniques of peripheral nerve DTI and tractography are 
      discussed with respect to peripheral nerve trauma, with illustrative cases 
      demonstrating potential roles of these novel approaches.

TI  - Image Possibilities of the Peripheral Nerve Tumor Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging - 
      Case Report.
PG  - 9-13
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and 
      morphological analysis of peripheral nerve tumours (PNTs). In recent years, a number 
      of novel MRI sequences such as MR neurography (MRN), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      or MR tractography (MRT) have emerged extending the range of conventional MRI 
      techniques. These advanced sequences are able to provide detailed information 
      concerning PNTs structure, including the course and function of individual neural 
      fascicles. This data can then be utilized in tailoring a suitable surgical 
      procedure, reducing the risks of postoperative neurological deficit. The following 
      case report of a median nerve tumour demonstrates the range and practicality of 
      current MRI techniques. With continuing advancement and perfection of these MRI 
      techniques, we can expect their integration into standard diagnostic protocols of 
      PNTs.

TI  - In vivo three-dimensional reconstruction of human median nerves by diffusion tensor 
      imaging.
PG  - 479-82
AB  - The in vivo assessment of axonal projections of the peripheral nervous system has 
      been severely limited by the lack of noninvasive techniques. We examined whether MR 
      diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking of the human median nerve is feasible. 
      The median nerve was examined with a 3-T MRI scanner in wrists of three healthy 
      volunteers and the wrist of a patient after median nerve repair. In vivo 
      three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of axonal projections of the median nerve 
      could be achieved in healthy volunteers with intact median nerves and a patient with 
      a transected median nerve using diffusion tensor imaging combined with fiber 
      tracking. The median nerve could be visualized and correlated well to the expected 
      location on T1-weighted images in the patient and all volunteers. The transected 
      median nerve in the patient could be detected up to the site of repair one month 
      postoperatively, whereas the nerve could not be detected more distally immediately 
      after repair. Two months postoperatively, it could clearly be tracked more distally, 
      indicating nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging can detect the median nerve 
      in healthy individuals as well as up to the lesion site in a patient with a complete 
      transection of the median nerve.

TI  - Phase Difference-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging (PADRE) Technique for the 
      Detection of Age-Related Microstructural Changes in Optic Radiation: Comparison with 
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI).
PG  - 5495-5503
AB  - BACKGROUND The optic radiation (OR) is a white-matter bundle connecting the lateral 
      geniculate body and the visual cortex. Phase difference-enhanced imaging (PADRE) is 
      a new MRI technique that is able to achieve precise delineation of the OR. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate the effect of age on the volume and signal 
      intensity of the OR using PADRE, and to establish a volumetric reference of the OR 
      from a healthy population, compared with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS Thirty-nine healthy volunteers underwent MR imaging with PADRE and DTI 
      sequences on a 3.0-T scanner. For the volumetric analysis with PADRE, the OR 
      corresponding to the external sagittal stratum was manually traced, while an 
      automated thresholding method was used for the DTI-based volumetric analysis of the 
      OR. RESULTS The mean right and left OR volumes measured from the PADRE images were 
      1469.0±242.4 mm³ and 1372.6±310.2 mm³, respectively. Although OR volume showed no 
      significant correlation with age, the normalized OR signal intensity showed a linear 
      correlation with increasing age (r²=0.50-0.53; P<0.01). The OR signal intensity on 
      PADRE and DTI-related quantitative parameters for the OR showed significant 
      correlations (r²=0.46-0.49; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS The PADRE technique revealed 
      exceptional preservation of OR volume, even in later life. Moreover, PADRE was able 
      to detect age-related changes in signal intensity of the OR and may contribute to 
      future analyses of pathological neurodegeneration in patients with glaucoma and 
      multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging detects axonal injury and demyelination in the spinal cord 
      and cranial nerves of a murine model of globoid cell leukodystrophy.
PG  - 1100-6
LID - 10.1002/nbm.1420 [doi]
AB  - Globoid cell leukodystrophy is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase. In both human patients and 
      the authentic murine Twitcher model, pathological findings include demyelination as 
      well as axonal damage in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) has emerged as a powerful noninvasive technique that is 
      sensitive to these white matter disease processes. Increases in radial diffusivity 
      (lambda perpendicular) and decreases in axial diffusivity (lambda parallel) 
      correlate with histopathological evidence of demyelination and axonal damage, 
      respectively. Compared to age-matched, normal littermates, DTI of optic nerve and 
      trigeminal nerve in end-stage Twitcher mice displayed a statistically significant 
      increase in lambda perpendicular and decrease in lambda parallel, consistent with 
      previously characterized demyelination and axonal damage in these regions. In the 
      Twitcher spinal cord, a statistically significant decrease in lambda parallel was 
      identified in both the dorsal and ventrolateral white matter, relative to normal 
      controls. These results were consistent with immunofluorescence evidence of axonal 
      damage in these areas as detected by staining for nonphosphorylated neurofilaments 
      (SMI32). Increase in lambda perpendicular in Twitcher spinal cord white matter 
      relative to normal controls reached statistical significance in the dorsal columns 
      and approached statistical significance in the ventrolateral region. Correlative 
      reduced levels of myelin basic protein were detected by immunofluorescent staining 
      in both these white matter regions in the Twitcher spinal cord. Fractional 
      anisotropy, a nonspecific but sensitive indicator of white matter disease, was 
      significantly reduced in the optic nerve, trigeminal nerve, and throughout the 
      spinal cord white matter of Twitcher mice, relative to normal controls. This first 
      reported application of spinal cord DTI in the setting of GLD holds potential as a 
      noninvasive, quantitative assay of therapeutic efficacy in future treatment studies.

TI  - Quantitative Evaluation of the Compressed L5 and S1 Nerve Roots in Unilateral Lumbar 
      Disc Herniation by Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
PG  - 529-537
LID - 10.1007/s00062-017-0621-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nerve root compression by lumbar disc herniation (LDH) 
      induces a series of clinical symptoms, seriously affecting the patient's life and 
      work. The purpose of this study is to investigate microstructural changes and fiber 
      bundle abnormalities of the compressed L5 and S1 nerve roots in young patients with 
      unilateral LDH by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Forty young 
      patients with unilateral LDH and 17 healthy volunteers participated in the study, 
      and 33 patients received follow-up DTI examination after one month of conservative 
      treatment. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and 
      trace weight (TraceW) values of the L5 and S1 nerve roots were measured on FA maps. 
      RESULTS: The mean FA, ADC and TraceW values of the affected nerve roots were 0.259 ± 
      0.047, 1.79 ± 0.252 and 0.076 ± 0.025, respectively. Compared to the contralateral 
      side and volunteers, the affected nerve roots showed a decreased FA (P < 0.01), an 
      increased ADC (P < 0.01) and TraceW (P < 0.05). The compression severity had 
      a moderately negative correlation with FA (r = -0.646, P < 0.01) and positive 
      correlation with ADC (r = 0.408, P < 0.01) but not with TraceW (r = 0.298, P = 
      0.06). For 33 patients with follow-up study after conservative treatment, FA 
      (0.286 ± 0.06) and ADC (1.630 ± 0.046) in the affected nerve roots showed an 
      increasing and a decreasing trend, respectively. Moreover, FA values (14 cases; 
      0.246 ± 0.015, P = 0.213) in the severe compression group had no significant changes 
      between initial and follow-up data. CONCLUSIONS: DTI is able to assess 
      microstructural abnormalities of the compressed nerve roots and has potentially 
      practical value for prognostic evaluation after treatment in patients with LDH.

AB  - PURPOSE: To quantitatively analyze the optic nerve alterations in chronic Leber's 
      hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) using reduced field-of-view diffusion tensor 
      imaging (rFOV-DTI) and evaluate the correlation of diffusion parameters with visual 
      functional and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. METHODS: 
      Twenty-five patients (50 affected optic nerves) with chronic LHON and 28 healthy 
      controls (56 normal optic nerves) were enrolled. The rFOV-DTI was performed in the 
      bilateral optic nerves for all the subjects. The fractional anisotropy (FA), mean 
      diffusivity (MD), principal eigenvalue (λ//), and orthogonal eigenvalue (λ⊥) were 
      calculated for quantitative analysis. Visual field (VF) and visual acuity (VA) were 
      measured in all subjects. The peripapillary RNFL thickness was assessed using 
      optical coherence tomography (OCT). The correlation of DTI diffusion parameters with 
      visual function and peripapillary RNFL thickness was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared 
      with optic nerves in the control group, the mean FA was significant decreased 
      (P<0.005), and the mean MD, λ//and λ⊥ significant increased (P<0.005). The average 
      and temporal peripapillary RNFL thickness were significantly thinned in LHON 
      patients. There was a significant correlation between optic nerve FA and VA, mean 
      deviation of visual field (MD(VF)) (P<0.005). Also, optic nerve FA correlated 
      significantly with average RNFL thickness (P<0.05) but not with MD, λ//and λ⊥ 
      (P>0.05). However, none of the DTI parameters correlated with age and disease 
      duration (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated that rFOV-DTI could 
      provide information of optic nerve damage in chronic LHON, and can serve as

TI  - Predictability of the effects of epidural injection in lumbar spinal stenosis by 
      assessment of lumbar MRI scans.
PG  - 613-621
LID - 10.3233/BMR-181249 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous classification systems have been proposed to interpret lumbar 
      MRI scans. The clinical impact of the measured parameters remains unclear. To 
      evaluate the clinical significance of imaging results in patients with 
      multisegmental degenerative pathologies, treating specialists can perform 
      image-guided local injections to target defined areas such as the epidural space. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the correlation 
      between lumbar spinal stenosis measurements obtained by MRI and improvement obtained 
      through local epidural injection. METHODS: In this retrospective study various 
      measurement and classification systems for lumbar spinal stenosis were applied to 
      MRI scans of 100 patients with this pathological condition. The reported effect of 
      epidural bupivacaine/triamcinolone injections at the site was recorded in these 
      patients and a comparative analysis performed. RESULTS: MRI features assessed in 
      this study did not show any relevant correlation with reported pain relief after 
      epidural injection in patients with chronic lumbar stenosis, with the exception of 
      posterior disc height with a weak Kendall's tau of -0.187 (p= 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although MRI is crucial for evaluating lumbar spinal stenosis, it cannot replace but 
      is rather complementary to a good patient history and clinical examination or the 
      results of local diagnostic injections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We compared different surgical techniques for nerve regeneration in a 
      rabbit sciatic nerve gap model using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI), electrophysiology, limb function, and histology. METHODS: A total of 24 male 
      New Zealand white rabbits were randomized into three groups: autograft (n = 8), 
      hollow conduit (n = 8), and collagen-filled conduit (n = 8). A 10-mm segment of the 
      rabbit proximal sciatic nerve was cut, and autograft or collagen conduit was used to 
      bridge the gap. DTI on a 3-T system was performed preoperatively and 13 weeks after 
      surgery using the contralateral, nonoperated nerve as a control. RESULTS: Overall, 
      autograft performed better compared with both conduit groups. Differences in axonal 
      diameter were significant (autograft > hollow conduit > collagen-filled conduit) at 
      13 weeks (autograft vs. hollow conduit, p = 0.001, and hollow conduit vs. 
      collagen-filled conduit, p < 0.001). Significant group differences were found for 
      axial diffusivity but not for any of the other DTI metrics (autograft > hollow 
      conduit > collagen-filled conduit) (autograft vs. hollow conduit, p = 0.001 and 
      hollow conduit vs. collagen-filled conduit, p = 0.021). As compared with hollow 
      conduit (autograft > collagen-filled conduit > hollow conduit), collagen-filled 
      conduit animals demonstrated a nonsignificant increased maximum tetanic force. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Autograft-treated rabbits demonstrated improved sciatic nerve 
      regeneration compared with collagen-filled and hollow conduits as assessed by 
      histologic, functional, and DTI parameters at 13 weeks.

      safety, feasibility, and clinical outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVECurrently, there is no treatment that slows or halts the progression of 
      Parkinson's disease. Delivery of various neurotrophic factors to restore 
      dopaminergic function has become a focus of study in an effort to fill this unmet 
      need for patients with Parkinson's disease. Schwann cells provide a readily 
      available source of such factors. This study presents a 12-month evaluation of 
      safety and feasibility, as well as the clinical response, of implanting autologous 
      peripheral nerve grafts into the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's 
      disease at the time of deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.METHODSStandard DBS 
      surgery targeting the subthalamic nucleus was performed in 8 study participants. 
      After DBS lead implantation, a section of the sural nerve containing Schwann cells 
      was harvested and unilaterally grafted to the substantia nigra. Adverse events were 
      continually monitored. Baseline clinical data were obtained during standard 
      preoperative evaluations. Clinical outcome data were obtained with postoperative 
      clinical evaluations, neuropsychological testing, and MRI at 1 year after 
      surgery.RESULTSAll 8 participants were implanted with DBS systems and grafts. 
      Adverse event profiles were comparable to those of standard DBS surgery with the 
      exception of 1 superficial infection at the sural nerve harvest site. Three 
      participants also reported numbness in the distribution of the sural nerve distal to 
      the harvest site. Motor scores on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 
      part III while the participant was off therapy at 12 months improved from baseline 
      (mean ± SD 25.1 ± 15.9 points at 12 months vs 32.5 ± 9.7 points at baseline). An 
      analysis of the lateralized UPDRS scores also showed a greater overall reduction in 
      scores on the side contralateral to the graft.CONCLUSIONSPeripheral nerve graft 
      delivery to the substantia nigra at the time of DBS surgery is feasible and safe 
      based on the results of this initial pilot study. Clinical outcome data from this 
      phase I trial suggests that grafting may have some clinical benefit and certainly 
      warrants further study to determine if this is an efficacious and neurorestorative 
      therapy.Clinical trial registration no.: NCT01833364 (clinicaltrials.gov).

TI  - Peripheral nerve repair: monitoring by using gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging with 
      chitosan nerve conduits with cultured mesenchymal stem cells in rat model of 
      neurotmesis.
PG  - 161-71
LID - 10.1148/radiol.11110911 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To observe the longitudinal changes of nerve repair in rats after 
      tissue-engineered construct implantation at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to 
      determine whether the enhanced nerve regeneration with use of tissue-engineered 
      constructs could be monitored with gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging or nerve T2 
      relaxation time measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All experimental protocols were 
      approved by the institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Tissue-engineered 
      constructs were prepared by seeding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chitosan 
      nerve tubes. Thirty-six rats with sciatic nerve transection injury underwent nerve 
      tube implantation with (n = 18) or without (n = 18) MSC seeding. Sequential T2 
      measurement, gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging, and sciatic function index 
      measurement were performed over an 8-week follow-up period, with histologic 
      assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and signal intensity 
      at gadofluorine M-enhanced T1-weighted imaging were measured and were compared by 
      using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by the Student-Neuman-Keuls 
      post-hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: Nerve T2 relaxation times 
      and gadofluorine M enhancement, as well as functional changes, showed a similar time 
      course. Nerves implanted with MSC-seeded tubes achieved slightly better functional 
      recovery and enhanced nerve regeneration while showing a slower return to baseline 
      T2 relaxation time and a more rapid decline in gadofluorine M enhancement compared 
      with nerves implanted with chitosan tubes alone. T2 values of the distal portion of 
      transected nerves showed a more rapid return to baseline level than did gadofluorine 
      M enhancement. CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve repair with use of tissue-engineered 
      constructs can be monitored by using gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and T2 
      relaxation time measurements. T2 relaxation time seems more sensitive than 
      gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging for detecting nerve regeneration.

TI  - Diffusion tensor-based imaging reveals occult abnormalities in 
      adrenomyeloneuropathy.
PG  - 758-66
AB  - "Pure" adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is the noninflammatory myeloneuropathic variant 
      of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, where the disease process appears to be restricted 
      to spinal cord tracts and peripheral nerves. The absence of obvious brain 
      involvement makes it distinct from the inflammatory cerebral phenotypes of X-linked 
      adrenoleukodystrophy. However, some pure AMN patients later experience development 
      of cerebral demyelination, but little is known about the extent of brain involvement 
      in pure AMN patients who have normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. We used 
      diffusion tensor imaging to investigate possible occult cerebral abnormalities in 
      such pure AMN patients. Fractional anisotropy and trace were studied in 
      three-dimensional reconstructions of white matter tracts commonly involved in 
      cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Results demonstrated reduced 
      fractional anisotropy and increased trace in bilateral corticospinal tracts and genu 
      of corpus callosum (p < 0.05). Diffusion tensor imaging-based three-dimensional 
      fiber tracking showed occult tract-specific cerebral microstructural abnormalities 
      in pure AMN patients who had a normal conventional brain magnetic resonance image. 
      Corticospinal tract abnormalities could reflect a centripetal extension of spinal 
      cord long-tract distal axonopathy. Accompanying abnormalities in genu of corpus 
      callosum indicate that the disease pathology in pure AMN may not be limited to 
      spinal cord long tracts alone, although the involvement of the latter is most 
      prominent and severe.

TI  - Age is a predictive factor in the femoral nerve positioning: an anatomical 
      ultrasound study.
PG  - 777-780
LID - 10.1007/s00540-018-2544-2 [doi]
AB  - Precise identification of the femoral nerve (FN) is essential for an 
      ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block. We hypothesized that the distance between the 
      FN and the femoral artery (FA) is correlated with patient age. In this prospective 
      observational study, we evaluated the FN-FA (from the lateral edge of the FA to the 
      medial edge of the FN) distance [0.42 ± 0.42 (mean ± standard deviation) cm] in 102 
      patients using ultrasound. In addition, we calculated the cross-sectional area of 
      the iliopsoas muscle using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. 
      Multiple regression analyses revealed that age was significantly and positively 
      correlated with the FN-FA distance (R(2) = 0.72, p < 0.001) and that this 
      correlation was greater than that between height, weight, or gender and the FN-FA 
      distance. Further, the cross-sectional area of the iliopsoas muscle per weight was 
      significantly correlated with age (R(2) = 0.54, p < 0.001) and the FN-FA distance 
      (R(2) = 0.50, p < 0.001). These findings may help refine the ultrasound techniques 
      used for the femoral nerve block.

TI  - Microstructural changes are coincident with the improvement of clinical symptoms in 
      surgically treated compressed nerve roots.
PG  - 44678

LID - 44678
AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely used to visualize peripheral nerves, 
      but the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed using DTI. However, 
      there are no data regarding the association among microstructural changes evaluated 
      using DTI, the symptoms assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the 
      duration of symptoms after surgery in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). 
      Thirty patients with unilateral radiculopathy were investigated using DTI. The 
      changes in the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) values as well as the correlation between these changes and the 
      severity and duration of the clinical symptoms were investigated before and at least 
      one month after surgery. The FA values were significantly increased after surgical 
      treatment (p < 0.0001). Both the ADC and ODI values were noticeably decreased 
      (p < 0.0001). A strong positive correlation between the preoperative and 
      postoperative DTI parameters (p < 0.0001) as well as between the preoperative ODI 
      and postoperative ODI/ODI changes (p < 0.0001) were found. In addition, there was a 
      significant positive correlation between the changes in the DTI parameters and 
      changes in the ODI (p < 0.0001). This preliminary study suggests it may be possible 
      to use DTI to diagnose, quantitatively evaluate and follow-up patients with LDH.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of the median nerve at 3.0 T using different MR scanners: 
      agreement of FA and ADC measurements.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the agreement of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median nerve on 3.0 T MR scanners from 
      different vendors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IRB approved study including 16 healthy 
      volunteers (9 women; mean age 30.6 ± 5.3 years). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 
      the dominant wrist was performed on three 3.0 T MR scanners (GE, Siemens, Philips) 
      using similar imaging protocols and vendor-proprietary hard- and software. Intra-, 
      inter-reader and inter-vendor agreements were assessed. RESULTS: ICCs for 
      intra-/inter-reader agreements ranged from 0.843-0.970/0.846-0.956 for FA, and 
      0.840-0.940/0.726-0.929 for ADC, respectively. ANOVA analysis identified significant 
      differences for FA/ADC measurements among vendors (p < 0.001/p < 0.01, 
      respectively). Overall mean values for FA were 0.63 (SD ± 0.1) and 0.999 × 
      10(-3)mm(2)/s (SD ± 0.134 × 10(-3)) for ADC. A significant negative measurement bias 
      was found for FA values from the GE scanner (-0.05 and -0.07) and for ADC values 
      from the Siemens scanner (-0.053 and -0.063 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) as compared to the 
      remainder vendors CONCLUSION: FA and ADC values of the median nerve obtained on 
      different 3.0 T MR scanners differ significantly, but are in comparison to the 
      standard deviation of absolute values small enough to not have an impact on larger 
      group studies or when substantial diffusion changes can be expected. However, 
      caution is warranted in an individual patient when interpreting diffusion values 
      from different scanner acquisitions.

TI  - Relationships between the integrity and function of lumbar nerve roots as assessed 
      by diffusion tensor imaging and neurophysiology.
PG  - 893-903
LID - 10.1007/s00234-017-1869-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in the measurement of 
      peripheral nerve integrity, although the optimal way to apply the technique for the 
      study of lumbar spinal nerves is unclear. The aims of this study are to use an 
      improved DTI acquisition to investigate lumbar nerve root integrity and correlate 
      this with functional measures using neurophysiology. METHODS: Twenty healthy 
      volunteers underwent 3 T DTI of the L5/S1 area. Regions of interest were applied to 
      L5 and S1 nerve roots, and DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and 
      radial diffusivity) were derived. Neurophysiological measures were obtained from 
      muscles innervated by L5/S1 nerves; these included the slope of motor-evoked 
      potential input-output curves, F-wave latency, maximal motor response, and central 
      and peripheral motor conduction times. RESULTS: DTI metrics were similar between the 
      left and right sides and between vertebral levels. Conversely, significant 
      differences in DTI measures were seen along the course of the nerves. Regression 
      analyses revealed that DTI metrics of the L5 nerve correlated with 
      neurophysiological measures from the muscle innervated by it. CONCLUSION: The 
      current findings suggest that DTI has the potential to be used for assessing lumbar 
      spinal nerve integrity and that parameters derived from DTI provide quantitative 
      information which reflects their function.

TI  - Accelerated magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging of the median nerve using 
      simultaneous multi-slice echo planar imaging with blipped CAIPIRINHA.
PG  - 1921-8
LID - 10.1007/s00330-015-3985-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the 
      median nerve using simultaneous multi-slice echo planar imaging (EPI) with blipped 
      CAIPIRINHA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After federal ethics board approval, MR imaging 
      of the median nerves of eight healthy volunteers (mean age, 29.4 years; range, 
      25-32) was performed at 3 T using a 16-channel hand/wrist coil. An EPI sequence 
      (b-value, 1,000 s/mm(2); 20 gradient directions) was acquired without acceleration 
      as well as with twofold and threefold slice acceleration. Fractional anisotropy 
      (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and quality of nerve tractography (number of tracks, 
      average track length, track homogeneity, anatomical accuracy) were compared between 
      the acquisitions using multivariate ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: 
      Acquisition time was 6:08 min for standard DTI, 3:38 min for twofold and 2:31 min 
      for threefold acceleration. No differences were found regarding FA (standard DTI: 
      0.620 ± 0.058; twofold acceleration: 0.642 ± 0.058; threefold acceleration: 
      0.644 ± 0.061; p ≥ 0.217) and MD (standard DTI: 1.076 ± 0.080 mm(2)/s; twofold 
      acceleration: 1.016 ± 0.123 mm(2)/s; threefold acceleration: 0.979 ± 0.153 mm(2)/s; 
      p ≥ 0.074). Twofold acceleration yielded similar tractography quality compared to 
      standard DTI (p > 0.05). With threefold acceleration, however, average track length 
      and track homogeneity decreased (p = 0.004-0.021). CONCLUSION: Accelerated DTI of 
      the median nerve is feasible. Twofold acceleration yields similar results to 
      standard DTI. KEY POINTS: • Standard DTI of the median nerve is limited by its long 
      acquisition time. • Simultaneous multi-slice acquisition is a new technique for 
      accelerated DTI. • Accelerated DTI of the median nerve yields similar results to 
      standard DTI.

TI  - Deterministic Tractography of the Descending Tract of the Spinal Trigeminal Nerve 
      Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
PG  - 539-544
LID - 10.1111/jon.12425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pain information from the face enters the pons via the 
      trigeminal nerve before creating an anatomical "elbow" that turns caudally into the 
      spinal trigeminal tract (SpTV). Visualization of the descending tract of the 
      trigeminal nerve as it begins its descent from the nerve root entry zone (NREZ) in 
      the pons would improve the accuracy of current procedures aimed at altering or 
      lesioning the trigeminal nerve within the brainstem. The focus of this study was to 
      develop a standardized protocol using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 
      deterministic tractography methods to image the SpTV. There are currently no 
      standard techniques used to visualize the trigeminal nerve using DTI. METHODS: DTI 
      and tractography were performed on 20 patients: 17 with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), 1 
      with hemifacial spasm, 1 with a facial nerve tumor, and 1 with an arteriovenous 
      malformation. A standardized protocol was developed using regions of interest (ROIs) 
      located at the SpTV, as determined by a brainstem atlas, and the NREZ. RESULTS: 
      Using our standardized protocol, the descending tract of the trigeminal nerve was 
      successfully visualized in all 20 patients. Trigeminal fibers entered the pons at 
      the NREZ and descended through the SpTV. The accuracy of the visualized tract was 
      confirmed through coregistration with a stereotactic atlas and anatomical scan. 
      CONCLUSION: A successful, robust DTI imaging and postprocessing protocol of the SpTV 
      contributes to our understanding of its anatomical distribution within the brainstem 
      and is a potentially new neurosurgical planning tool.

TI  - Evidence for a novel subcortical mechanism for posterior cingulate cortex atrophy in 
      HIV peripheral neuropathy.
PG  - 530-543
LID - 10.1007/s13365-020-00850-3 [doi]
AB  - We previously reported that neuropathic pain was associated with smaller posterior 
      cingulate cortical (PCC) volumes, suggesting that a smaller/dysfunctional PCC may 
      contribute to development of pain via impaired mind wandering. A gap in our previous 
      report was lack of evidence for a mechanism for the genesis of PCC atrophy in HIV 
      peripheral neuropathy. Here we investigate if volumetric differences in the 
      subcortex for those with neuropathic paresthesia may contribute to smaller PCC 
      volumes, potentially through deafferentation of ascending white matter tracts 
      resulting from peripheral nerve damage in HIV neuropathy. Since neuropathic pain and 
      paresthesia are highly correlated, statistical decomposition was used to separate 
      pain and paresthesia symptoms to determine which regions of brain atrophy are 
      associated with both pain and paresthesia and which are associated separately with 
      pain or paresthesia. HIV+ individuals (N = 233) with and without paresthesia in a 
      multisite study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based 
      morphometry and a segmentation/registration tool were used to investigate regional 
      brain volume changes associated with paresthesia. Analysis of decomposed variables 
      found that smaller midbrain and thalamus volumes were associated with paresthesia 
      rather than pain. However, atrophy in the PCC was related to both pain and 
      paresthesia. Peak thalamic atrophy (p = 0.004; MNI x = - 14, y = - 24, z = - 2) for 
      more severe paresthesia was in a region with reciprocal connections with the PCC. 
      This provides initial evidence that smaller PCC volumes in HIV peripheral neuropathy 
      are related to ascending white matter deafferentation caused by small fiber damage 
      observed in HIV peripheral neuropathy.

TI  - Architectural configuration and microstructural properties of the sacral plexus: a 
      diffusion tensor MRI and fiber tractography study.
PG  - 1792-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.06.001 [doi]
AB  - The ability to investigate microstructural properties of the central nervous system 
      with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown in many studies. More recently, 
      DTI is being applied outside the brain showing promising results, for instance, for 
      investigating muscle tissue. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography to study the nerves of the 
      sacral plexus in humans in vivo and to assess the architectural configuration and 
      microstructural properties of these peripheral nerves. For this research goal we 
      optimized the acquisition parameters of a DTI sequence and acquired data from 10 
      healthy adults and one 12-year patient having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder 
      dysfunction. For the healthy volunteers, we estimated the fractional anisotropy (FA) 
      and mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial diffusivities (RD) of the sacral plexus nerves 
      which may serve as a baseline for future studies. We demonstrated that tractography 
      of the sacral plexus on a 3 Tesla MR scanner is feasible, giving 3D insight in the 
      general anatomy and organization of the nerves L4 to S3. In addition, branches to 
      the pudendal nerve were also found in 4 volunteers. There were no significant 
      differences in any of the estimated diffusion measures between the right and left 
      sided nerves or between the nerves L4 to S3 on an intra-subject basis. Furthermore, 
      clinical feasibility of DTI and tractography in a child having spina bifida and 
      neurogenic bladder dysfunction is demonstrated. The architectural configuration of 
      the child's sacral plexus was comparable with the healthy volunteers and no 
      significant disrupted nerve fibers were observed. However, there are strong 
      indications that abnormal diffusion characteristics are present at the level of the 
      neural tube defect due to incomplete segments of the nerves that are close to the 
      vertebrae. These findings are encouraging for using DTI as a means to investigate 
      changes in microstructural properties of the nerves of the sacral plexus. Moreover, 
      this new methodology may provide a new avenue to a better analysis and diagnosis of 
      neurogenic bladder dysfunctions.

TI  - DTI Study of Cerebral Normal-Appearing White Matter in Hereditary Neuropathy With

AB  - The majority of previous studies on hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure 
      palsies (HNPP) were focused on peripheral nerves, whereas cerebral alterations in 
      HNPP have been less attended to. In this work, Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was 
      used to detect the changes in WM, especially in the normal-appearing white matter 
      (NAWM) in HNPP patients for its sensitivity in probing the microstructure of WM, the 
      sensitive metric was searched for probing cerebral alterations and the regional 
      distribution of cerebral abnormalities was identified. Twelve HNPP patients and 12 
      age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent the conventional MRI, DTI scan, 
      and electrophysiological examination. The conventional MRI images were first 
      analyzed to identify abnormal intense regions and the NAWM regions. NAWM refers to 
      the white matter regions that do not include the lesions on conventional MRI. The 
      apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the NAWM 
      were then measured and compared between patient and control groups. The sensitivity 
      and specificity of 3 methods and the cerebral regional distribution of MR signal 
      abnormalities were further analyzed. Hyperintense foci were observed on T2 weighted 
      image and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images in 6 patients. Compared to the 
      controls, FA values of the patients were significantly lower in bilateral frontal, 
      orbitofrontal, and temporal NAWMs; whereas the electrophysiological examination 
      results of patients and controls exhibited no statistically significant difference. 
      The sensitivity of FA value was higher than that of electrophysiological examination 
      and conventional MRI. The majority of abnormal signals on conventional MRI images 
      and abnormal FA values were located in the frontal and temporal lobes. The results 
      of our study show cerebral WM changes in HNPP patients. FA value in DTI has been 
      shown to be sensitive to the cerebral microstructural changes in HNPP. The frontal 
      lobe is the predilection site that is most involved in HNPP.

      trigeminal neuralgia.

AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic neuropathic facial pain disorder that 
      commonly responds to surgery. A proportion of patients, however, do not benefit and 
      suffer ongoing pain. There are currently no imaging tools that permit the prediction 
      of treatment response. To address this paucity, we used diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) to determine whether pre-surgical trigeminal nerve microstructural 
      diffusivities can prognosticate response to TN treatment. In 31 TN patients and 16 
      healthy controls, multi-tensor tractography was used to extract DTI-derived 
      metrics-axial (AD), radial (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy 
      (FA)-from the cisternal segment, root entry zone and pontine segment of trigeminal 
      nerves for false discovery rate-corrected Student's t-tests. Ipsilateral 
      diffusivities were bootstrap resampled to visualize group-level diffusivity 
      thresholds of long-term response. To obtain an individual-level statistical 
      classifier of surgical response, we conducted discriminant function analysis (DFA) 
      with the type of surgery chosen alongside ipsilateral measurements and 
      ipsilateral/contralateral ratios of AD and RD from all regions of interest as 
      prediction variables. Abnormal diffusivity in the trigeminal pontine fibers, 
      demonstrated by increased AD, highlighted non-responders (n = 14) compared to 
      controls. Bootstrap resampling revealed three ipsilateral diffusivity thresholds of 
      response-pontine AD, MD, cisternal FA-separating 85% of non-responders from 
      responders. DFA produced an 83.9% (71.0% using leave-one-out-cross-validation) 
      accurate prognosticator of response that successfully identified 12/14 
      non-responders. Our study demonstrates that pre-surgical DTI metrics can serve as a 
      highly predictive, individualized tool to prognosticate surgical response. We 
      further highlight abnormal pontine segment diffusivities as key features of 
      treatment non-response and confirm the axiom that central pain does not commonly 
      benefit from peripheral treatments.

TI  - Morphology of subcortical brain nuclei is associated with autonomic function in 
      healthy humans.
PG  - 381-392
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23850 [doi]
AB  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a brain body interface which serves to 
      maintain homeostasis by influencing a plethora of physiological processes, including 
      metabolism, cardiorespiratory regulation and nociception. Accumulating evidence 
      suggests that ANS function is disturbed in numerous prevalent clinical disorders, 
      including irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. While the brain is a central 
      hub for regulating autonomic function, the association between resting autonomic 
      activity and subcortical morphology has not been comprehensively studied and thus 
      was our aim. In 27 healthy subjects [14 male and 13 female; mean age 30 years (range 
      22-53 years)], we quantified resting ANS function using validated indices of cardiac 
      sympathetic index (CSI) and parasympathetic cardiac vagal tone (CVT). High 
      resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired, and 
      differences in subcortical nuclei shape, that is, 'deformation', contingent on 
      resting ANS activity were investigated. CSI positively correlated with outward 
      deformation of the brainstem, right nucleus accumbens, right amygdala and bilateral 
      pallidum (all thresholded to corrected P < 0.05). In contrast, parasympathetic CVT 
      negatively correlated with inward deformation of the right amygdala and pallidum 
      (all thresholded to corrected P < 0.05). Left and right putamen volume positively 
      correlated with CVT (r = 0.62, P = 0.0047 and r = 0.59, P = 0.008, respectively), as 
      did the brainstem (r = 0.46, P = 0.049). These data provide novel evidence that 
      resting autonomic state is associated with differences in the shape and volume of 
      subcortical nuclei. Thus, subcortical morphological brain differences in various 
      disorders may partly be attributable to perturbation in autonomic function. Further 
      work is warranted to investigate these findings in clinical populations. Hum Brain

TI  - Orientation entropy analysis of diffusion tensor in healthy and myelopathic spinal 
      cord.
PG  - 1028-33
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.072 [doi]
AB  - The majority of nerve fibers in the spinal cord run longitudinally, playing an 
      important role in connecting the brain to the peripheral nerves. There is a growing 
      interest in applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to the evaluation of spinal cord 
      microarchitecture. The current study sought to compare the organization of 
      longitudinal nerve fibers between healthy and myelopathic spinal cords using 
      entropy-based analysis of principal eigenvector mapping. A total of 22 subjects were 
      recruited, including 14 healthy subjects, seven cervical myelopathy (CM) patients 
      with single-level compression, and one patient suffering from multi-level 
      compression. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (MR) images of the cervical spinal 
      cord were obtained using a pulsed gradient, spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) 
      sequence with a 3T MR system. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually to 
      cover the spinal cord, and Shannon entropy was calculated in principal eigenvector 
      maps. The results revealed no significant differences in orientation entropy values 
      along the whole length of cervical spinal cord in healthy subjects (C2-3: 0.73±0.05; 
      C3-4: 0.71±0.07; C4-5: 0.72±0.048; C5-6: 0.71±0.07; C6-7: 0.72±0.07). In contrast, 
      orientation entropy values in myelopathic cord were significantly higher at the 
      compression site (0.91±0.03), and the adjacent levels (above: 0.85±0.03; below: 
      0.83±0.05). This study provides a novel approach to analyze the orientation 
      information in diffusion MR images of healthy and diseased spinal cord. These 
      results indicate that orientation entropy can be applied to determine the 
      contribution of each compression level to the overall disorganization of principal 
      nerve tracts of myelopathic spinal cord in cases with multi-level compression.

AB  - PURPOSE: Redundant nerve roots (RNRs) are a negative prognostic factor in patients 
      with central lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Forty percent of candidates for surgical 
      decompression show RNRs (RNR+) on preoperative conventional magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI). We investigated the prevalence of RNRs in three functional postures 
      (standing, neutral sitting and flexed sitting) with an upright MRI (upMRI). METHODS: 
      A retrospective observational study with a repeated measures design. Thirty surgical 
      candidates underwent upMRI. Sagittal and axial T2-weighted images of the three 
      functional postures were evaluated. The segmental length of the lumbar spine (sLLS), 
      the lordotic angle (LA) and the dural cross-sectional area (DCSA) were measured in 
      each body position. Generalized linear mixed models were carried out. The 0.05 level 
      of probability was set as the criterion for statistical significance. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of RNRs decreased from 80% during standing to 16.7% during flexed sitting 
      (p < 0.001). The sLLS increased significantly from standing to neutral sitting in 
      both RNR groups (p < 0.001). The increase from neutral sitting to flexed sitting was 
      only significant (p < 0.001) for the group without RNRs (RNR-). The LA decreased 
      significantly for both RNR groups from standing to flexed sitting (p < 0.001). The 
      DSCA increased significantly in the RNR- group (p < 0.001) but not in the RNR+ group 
      (p = 0.9). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of RNRs is body position dependent. Increases 
      in DCSA play a determinant role in resolving RNRs.

AB  - A 24-year-old woman was hit by a bus and suffered an isolated complete oculomotor 
      nerve palsy. Computed tomography scan did not show a skull base fracture. 
      T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed petechial cerebral hemorrhages 
      sparing the brainstem. T2 constructive interference in steady state suggested a 
      partial sectioning of the left oculomotor nerve just before entering the superior 
      orbital fissure. Diffusion tensor imaging fiber tractography confirmed a sharp 
      arrest of the left oculomotor nerve. This recent imaging technique could be of 
      interest to assess white fiber damage and help make a diagnosis or prognosis.

TI  - MR neurographic orthopantomogram: Ultrashort echo-time imaging of mandibular bone 
      and teeth complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR 
      neurography.
PG  - 393-400
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25178 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Panoramical radiographs or cone-beam computed tomography (CT) are the 
      standard-of-care in dental imaging to assess teeth, mandible, and mandibular canal 
      pathologies, but do not allow assessment of the inferior alveolar nerve itself nor 
      of its branches. We propose a new technique for "MR neurographic orthopantomograms" 
      exploiting ultrashort echo-time (UTE) imaging of bone and teeth complemented with 
      high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      The Institutional Review Board approved the study in 10 healthy volunteers. Imaging 
      of the subjects mandibles at 3.0T (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens-Healthcare) using a 
      64-channel head coil with isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar 
      reformatting, was performed. Bone images were acquired using a 3D PETRA sequence 
      (TE, 0.07 msec). Morphological nerve imaging was performed using a dedicated 3D PSIF 
      and 3D SPACE STIR sequence. Functional MR neurography was accomplished using a new 
      accelerated diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) prototype sequence (2D SMS-accelerated 
      RESOLVE). Qualitative and quantitative image analysis was performed and descriptive 
      statistics are provided. RESULTS: Image acquisition and subsequent postprocessing 
      into the MR neurographic orthopantomogram by overlay of morphological and functional 
      images were feasible in all 10 volunteers without artifacts. All mandibular bones 
      and mandibular nerves were assessable and considered normal. Fiber tractography with 
      quantitative evaluation of physiological diffusion properties of mandibular nerves 
      yielded the following mean ± SD values: fractional anisotropy, 0.43 ± 0.07; mean 
      diffusivity (mm(2) /s), 0.0014 ± 0.0002; axial diffusivity, 0.0020 ± 0.0002, and 
      radial diffusivity, 0.0011 ± 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The proposed technique of MR 
      neurographic orthopantomogram exploiting UTE imaging complemented with 
      high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography was feasible and allowed 
      comprehensive assessment of osseous texture and neural microarchitecture in a single 
      examination. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;44:393-400.

TI  - Evaluation of radiation-induced peripheral nerve injury in rabbits with MR 
      neurography using diffusion tensor imaging and T2 measurements: Correlation with 
      histological and functional changes.
PG  - 1492-9
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25114 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 
      measurements in the evaluation of radiation-induced peripheral nerve injury (RIPNI). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: RIPNI was produced in a randomly selected side of sciatic 
      nerve in each of 21 rabbits while the contralateral side served as the control. The 
      limb function and MR parameters were evaluated over a 4-month period. Fractional 
      anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (λ∥ ), radial diffusivity (λ⊥ ) and T2 values 
      were obtained using 3T MR for quantitative analysis. Two animals were randomly 
      killed for histological evaluation at each timepoint. RESULTS: The T2 value of 
      irradiated nerve increased at 1 day (63.95 ± 15.60, P = 0.012) and was restored at 1 
      month (52.34 ± 5.38, P = 0.105). It increased progressively at 2 to 4 months (60.39 
      ± 10.60, 66.96 ± 6.08, 75.51 ± 7.39, all P < 0.01). λ⊥ significantly increased at 1 
      day (0.82 ± 0.44, P = 0.046) and slightly decreased at 1 month (0.61 ± 0.17, P < 
      0.001). It increased gradually from 2 to 3 months (0.84 ± 0.29, 1.13 ± 0.33, both P 
      < 0.001) followed by a decline at 4 months (0.83 ± 0.17, P < 0.001). FA was 
      statistically lower than the contralateral sides at 1 to 4 months (0.72 ± 0.08, 0.60 
      ± 0.12, 0.51 ± 0.11, 0.62 ± 0.06, all P < 0.01). Changes in FA and λ⊥ correlated 
      well with the functional and pathological changes in irradiated nerve. CONCLUSION: 
      DTI may be a more sensitive and accurate method to evaluate RIPNI compared with T2 
      measurements. FA and λ⊥ are promising quantitative indices in monitoring RIPNI. J. 
      Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;43:1492-1499.

TI  - White matter microstructure of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and its 
      relation to inhibitory control.
PG  - 1731-1740
LID - 10.1007/s11682-016-9641-3 [doi]
AB  - Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is commonly associated with deficits in executive 
      functions such as working memory and inhibitory control. A valid biomarker to 
      describe the pathological basis of these deficits in NF1 is not available. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate whether any abnormalities in white matter integrity 
      of the executive function related anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), cingulate 
      bundle (CB), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) may be regarded as a 
      pathological basis for inhibitory control deficits in adolescents with NF1. Sixteen 
      NF1 patients and 32 healthy controls underwent 3 T DTI MRI scanning. Whole brain-, 
      ATR-, CB-, and SLF-white matter integrity were studied using fractional anisotropy, 
      mean (MD), radial, and axial (DA) diffusivity. Correlation analyses between white 
      matter metrics and inhibitory control (as measured with a computerized task) were 
      performed. Also, verbal and performance abilities (IQ-estimates) were assessed and 
      correlated with white matter metrics. Patients showed significant whole brain- and 
      local microstructural pathology when compared to healthy controls in all measures. 
      In NF1-patients, whole-brain (MD: r = .646 and DA: r = .673) and ATR- (r-range: 
      -.405-.771), but not the CB- (r-range: -.307-.472) and SLF- (r-range: -.187-.406) 
      white matter integrity, were correlated with inhibitory control. Verbal and 
      performance abilities were not associated with white matter pathology. In NF1, white 
      matter abnormalities are observed throughout the brain, but damage to the ATR seems 
      specifically, or at least most strongly related to inhibitory control. Future 
      studies should examine whether reduced white matter integrity in other brain regions 
      or tracts is (more strongly) associated with different aspects of the 
      cognitive-behavioral phenotype associated with NF1.

AB  - Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe and yet most poorly understood 
      complications of diabetes mellitus. In vivo imaging of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a 
      key structure for the understanding of DPN, has been restricted to animal studies. 
      These have shown a correlation of decreased DRG volume with neuropathic symptom 
      severity. Our objective was to investigate correlations of DRG morphology and signal 
      characteristics at 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) with clinical 
      and serological data in diabetic patients with and without DPN. In this 
      cross-sectional study, participants underwent 3T MRN of both L5 DRG using an 
      isotropic 3D T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence with subsequent segmentation of 
      DRG volume and analysis of normalized signal properties. Overall, 55 diabetes 
      patients (66 ± 9 years; 32 men; 30 with DPN) took part in this study. DRG volume was 
      smaller in patients with severe DPN when compared to patients with mild or moderate 
      DPN (134.7 ± 21.86 vs 170.1 ± 49.22; p = 0.040). In DPN patients, DRG volume was 
      negatively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r = -0.43; 95%CI = -0.66 
      to -0.14; p = 0.02), a measure of neuropathy severity. DRG volume showed negative 
      correlations with triglycerides (r = -0.40; 95%CI = -0.57 to -0.19; p = 0.006), and 
      LDL cholesterol (r = -0.33; 95%CI = -0.51 to -0.11; p = 0.04). There was a strong 
      positive correlation of normalized MR signal intensity (SI) with the neuropathy 
      symptom score in the subgroup of patients with painful DPN (r = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.46 
      to 0.93; p = 0.005). DRG SI was positively correlated with HbA1c levels (r = 0.30; 
      95%CI = 0.09 to 0.50; p = 0.03) and the triglyceride/HDL ratio (r = 0.40; 95%CI = 
      0.19 to 0.57; p = 0.007). In this first in vivo study, we found DRG morphological 
      degeneration and signal increase in correlation with neuropathy severity. This 
      elucidates the potential importance of MR-based DRG assessments in studying 
      structural and functional changes in DPN.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To achieve 3-dimensional (3D) display of peripheral nerves in the wrist 
      region by using maximum intensity projection (MIP) post-processing methods to 
      reconstruct raw images acquired by a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan, and to 
      explore its clinical applications. METHODS: We performed DTI scans in 6 (DTI6) and 
      25 (DTI25) diffusion directions on 20 wrists of 10 healthy young volunteers, 6 
      wrists of 5 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, 6 wrists of 6 patients with nerve 
      lacerations, and one patient with neurofibroma. The MIP post-processing methods 
      employed 2 types of DTI raw images: (1) single-direction and (2) T2-weighted trace. 
      The fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of 
      the median and ulnar nerves were measured at multiple testing sites. Two 
      radiologists used custom evaluation scales to assess the 3D nerve imaging quality 
      independently. RESULTS: In both DTI6 and DTI25, nerves in the wrist region could be 
      displayed clearly by the 2 MIP post-processing methods. The FA and ADC values were 
      not significantly different between DTI6 and DTI25, except for the FA values of the 
      ulnar nerves at the level of pisiform bone (p=0.03). As to the imaging quality of 
      each MIP post-processing method, there were no significant differences between DTI6 
      and DTI25 (p>0.05). The imaging quality of single-direction MIP post-processing was 
      better than that from T2-weighted traces (p<0.05) because of the higher nerve signal 
      intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional displays of peripheral nerves in the wrist 
      region can be achieved by MIP post-processing for single-direction images and 
      T2-weighted trace images for both DTI6 and DTI25. The FA and ADC values of the 
      median nerves can be accurately measured by using DTI6 data. Adopting 6-direction 
      DTI scan and MIP post-processing is an efficient method for evaluating peripheral 
      nerves.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preserving the facial nerve (FN) during surgery for large vestibular 
      schwannomas (VSs) is challenging because of the unpredictable locations and 
      morphologic changes in the FN. Diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking 
      (DTI-FT) has been proposed to preoperatively visualize the FN. This study was 
      performed to evaluate the efficacy of DTI-FT for predicting FN location and shape in 
      patients with large VSs. METHODS: In this prospective study, imaging data from 30 
      consecutive patients with large VSs were obtained using 3-T magnetic resonance 
      imaging. The DTI-FT results included the location of the reconstructed FN relative 
      to the tumor, and maximal fractional anisotropy (MFA) threshold values for FN 
      tracking were determined with iPlan software. Intraoperative findings including the 
      location of FN relative to the tumor and shape were determined by microscopic 
      observations and electrophysiologic monitoring. A correlation analysis was performed 
      between the DTI-FT results and intraoperative findings. RESULTS: Preoperative 
      visualization of the FN using DTI-FT was successful in all 30 patients. The location 
      of the cisternal segment of the FN in relation to the tumors predicted by DTI-FT was 
      consistent with the intraoperative findings in 29 (96.7%) of the 30 patients. The 
      area under the curve of MFA for differentiation between the compact and flat FN was 
      0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.98) (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: DTI-FT with 
      modified tracking settings was useful to preoperatively predict the location of FN 
      in patients with large VSs. The MFA of FN demonstrated moderate diagnostic 
      performance for distinguishing compact from flat FNs.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging of neurofibromatosis bright objects in children with

PG  - 616-26
LID - 10.15274/NRJ-2014-10055 [doi]
AB  - Neurofibromatosis bright objects (NBOs) are poorly understood. This article aimed to 
      investigate: 1) differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) between NBOs based in gray 
      matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and 2) the relationship between NBOs and the 
      affected white matter tracts. Fourteen NF1 patients were included in this study. 
      Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, radial diffusivity (RD) and eigenvalues 
      were used to compare NBOs and matching contralateral normal-appearing sites (NAS). 
      Diffusion tensor imaging scalars were also compared with age-matched healthy 
      controls. Fiber tractography was performed to assess NBO-induced changes in WM 
      trajectories. ADC values were higher for GM and WM NBOs than for NAS and controls. 
      FA values were lower in GM and WM NBOs compared with controls. In all regions, 
      eigenvalues were higher in NBOs than in NAS and controls. Only three out of 18 NOBs 
      appeared to disrupt WM tracts. ADC, λ2 and RD values of WM NBOs were higher in 
      symptomatic compared to asymptomatic patients. Increased ADC, RD and eigenvalues and 
      decreased FA values in NBOs can be explained by myelin and axonal damage. Increased 
      ADC values and RD in WM NBOs correlated with the presence of symptoms. Tract 
      integrity predominated in our study.

TI  - Simultaneous multislice readout-segmented echo planar imaging for accelerated 
      diffusion tensor imaging of the mandibular nerve: A feasibility study.
PG  - 663-677
LID - 10.1002/jmri.25603 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using 
      simultaneous multislice (SMS) acquisition with blipped controlled aliasing in 
      parallel imaging (CAIPI) for accelerated readout-segmented echo planar imaging 
      (rs-EPI) of the mandibular nerves. DTI of the mandibular nerves using EPI is 
      challenging due to susceptibility artifacts. Rs-EPI is less prone to artifacts but 
      associated with longer scan durations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight asymptomatic 
      volunteers were imaged at 3T using a 64-channel head/neck coil. Conventional, 2-fold 
      (2xSMS) and 3-fold (3xSMS) slice-accelerated rs-EPI sequences were acquired. 
      Tractography of the mandibular nerves was performed. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 
      fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and number of tracts were 
      calculated. Artifacts were evaluated qualitatively on Likert scales. Parameters were 
      compared statistically. Clinical feasibility of 2xSMS rs-EPI was tested in four 
      patients. RESULTS: SNR was similar for conventional (mean ± SD; 8.55 ± 3.90) and 
      2xSMS rs-EPI (7.83 ± 3.15) but lower for 3xSMS rs-EPI (5.42 ± 2.93; analysis of 
      variance, P = 0.004). FA was similar for all sequences (rs-EPI, 0.42 ± 0.08; 2xSMS 
      rs-EPI, 0.43 ± 0.08; 3xSMS rs-EPI, 0.44 ± 0.06), while 3xSMS rs-EPI showed lower MD 
      (rs-EPI, 0.0015 ± 0.0003; 2xSMS rs-EPI, 0.0014 ± 0.0001; 3xSMS rs-EPI, 
      0.0013 ± 0.0003) and lower number of tracts (rs-EPI, 66.56 ± 51.31; 2xSMS rs-EPI, 
      65.75 ± 55.40; 3xSMS rs-EPI, 37.93 ± 52.42) compared to rs-EPI and 2xSMS rs-EPI. 
      Additionally, 2xSMS rs-EPI was feasible in four clinical patients and provided 
      robust imaging results. CONCLUSION: 2xSMS rs-EPI yielded similar SNR, FA, and MD 
      values compared to conventional rs-EPI at reduced scan time and is feasible in 
      clinical patients. These findings suggest the potential clinical applicability of 
      rs-EPI for DTI of the mandibular nerve. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical Efficacy:

TI  - Effect of bleeding on nerve regeneration and epineural scar formation in rat sciatic 
      nerves: an experimental study.
PG  - 234-41
LID - 10.3944/AOTT.2015.15.0090 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epineural scar formation is one of the most significant negative factors 
      affecting surgical repair after peripheral nerve injury. The scar tissue 
      mechanically hinders axonal regeneration and causes adhesions between nerves and 
      surrounding tissues. A hemostatic agent Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS; İmmun Gıda İlaç 
      Kozmetik San. ve Tic. Ltd. Şti., Istanbul, Turkey) has not been previously used. 
      Decreasing the postoperative bleeding and adhesions between nerve and surrounding 
      tissues will prevent the formation of scar tissue, as well as corresponding 
      compressive neuropathy and/or deceleration of axonal regeneration. The purpose of 
      this experimental study was to investigate the effects of bleeding on nerve healing 
      and scar tissue after repair of peripheral nerve injuries. METHODS: The right 
      sciatic nerve of 30 Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 260-330 g) was cut 1.5 cm 
      proximal to the trifurcation and repaired primarily with 8/0 sutures using epineural 
      technique. The rats were then divided into 3 groups. Saline was applied in Group 1 
      (n=10), ABS in Group 2 (n=10), and heparin in Group 3 (n=10) for 5 minutes to the 
      repair site and surrounding tissues. In each group, electrophysiological 
      measurements were performed with electromyography (EMG) at postoperative week 12. 
      Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used at week 12. Macroscopical and 
      histopathological evaluations were conducted after sacrificing the rats at week 24 
      with total excision of the repaired sciatic nerves and surrounding tissues. RESULTS: 
      The ABS and saline groups showed better healing than the heparin group. The ABS and 
      saline groups were better in the histopathologic evaluations, but there was no 
      statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Statistically 
      significant differences were not found between the 3 groups. Significant results may 
      be obtained with larger studies.

TI  - MR imaging in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic foot drop.
PG  - 1283-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prolonged T2 relaxation time of denervated muscle has been 
      described in several clinical and experimental studies. The purpose of this study 
      was to evaluate the utility of MR imaging in the diagnosis of neurogenic muscle 
      disorders compared with that of clinical and electrophysiologic examination. 
      METHODS: In a prospective study, 40 consecutive patients clinically presenting with 
      a foot drop were included. MR imaging of the lower leg included axial T1-weighted 
      and axial turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM) sequences. Two readers blinded 
      to clinical data evaluated T1-weighted images for anatomic localization of affected 
      muscles and TIRM images for patterns of signal intensity increase. After MR imaging, 
      a detailed neurophysiologic examination was performed. Cause of foot drop was 
      independently determined on the basis of MR and electrophysiologic data. RESULTS: 
      Clinical examination and electromyography (EMG) disclosed 20 peroneal nerve lesions, 
      nine cases of L5 radiculopathy, and 11 nerve lesions extending beyond neural 
      structures. MR imaging revealed three distinct patterns of signal intensity increase 
      on TIRM images: peroneal nerve pattern, L5 pattern, and unspecific pattern. MR 
      imaging and EMG findings were in agreement in 37 (92%) of 40 patients. In three 
      patients, MR imaging revealed a more widespread involvement than did EMG. In one of 
      these patients, denervation in the corresponding muscle was validated by follow-up 
      EMG. No false-negative diagnoses were made by use of MR imaging as compared with use 
      of EMG. CONCLUSION: MR imaging improves accuracy in the differential diagnosis of 
      peripheral nerve lesions compared with that of EMG and can supplement EMG in the 
      diagnosis of denervated muscles.

TI  - Comparison of the detectability of UBOs in Neurofibromatosis Type I patients with 
      proton density-weighted and FLAIR sequences in 3T MRI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In NF 1 patients, significant numbers of so-called unidentified bright 
      objects (UBOs) can be found. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the 
      detectability of UBOs increases at 3T by comparing Proton density-weighted images 
      (PDw) with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: A total of 14 NF1 patients (7 male, 7 female, between 8 and 26 years old, 
      mean age 15.4 years) were examined by a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. The presence 
      of UBOs was evaluated on PD-w and FLAIR images by 4 evaluators. Detectability was 
      rated by a three-point scoring system: lesions which were "well defined/detectable", 
      "suspicious" or "detected after a second look". The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was 
      used for comparisons between the raters. The level of significance was P < 0.05. 
      RESULTS: Significantly more lesions were marked as "well defined/detectable" in the 
      PD-w Sequence compared to FLAIR at 3T (P < 0.001 for all four evaluators together, 
      as well as for each evaluator separately). In particular, PD-w proved to be superior 
      for detecting UBOs located in the medulla oblongata, dentate nucleus and hippocampal 
      region, regardless of the level of the raters' experience. CONCLUSION: This is the 
      first study which compares FLAIR and PD-w at 3T for the diagnosis of UBOs in NF1. At 
      this field strength significantly more UBOs were detected in the PD-w compared to 
      FLAIR sequences, especially for the infratentorial regions. As UBOs occur at very 
      early stages of the disease in patients with suspected NF1, PD-w might aid in the 
      early diagnosis when using 3T scanners.

TI  - Lumbar plexus in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
      polyradiculoneuropathy: evaluation with simultaneous T(2) mapping and neurography 
      method with SHINKEI.
PG  - 20180501

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of simultaneous T(2) mapping and neurography 
      with nerve-sheath signal increased with inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of 
      relaxation enhancement imaging (SHINKEI) in the lumbar plexus to distinguish 
      patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) from healthy 
      controls. METHODS: Our institutional review boards approved this retrospective 
      study, and written informed consent was waived. 10 patients with CIDP from 2015 to 
      2017 were studied along with 5 healthy controls on a 3 T scanner. The T(2) 
      relaxation time and the size of the dorsal root ganglia and nerves of the lumbar 
      plexus at L3-S1 were measured. Statistical analyses were performed with the 
      Mann-Whitney U test and a receiver operating characteristics analysis. RESULTS: The 
      T(2) relaxation times of the dorsal root ganglia and the nerves of the lumbar plexus 
      were longer in the CIDP patients (133.34  ±  41.36 and 130.40 ± 47.78 ms) compared 
      to the healthy controls (114.69 ± 24.90 and 83.72 ± 17.51 ms, p = 0.0265 and p < 
      0.0001, respectively). The sizes of the nerves were larger in the CIDP patients 
      (6.19  ±  2.28 mm) compared to the controls (4.54  ±  0.86 mm, p < 0.0001). However, 
      there was no significant difference between the sizes of the ganglia in the CIDP 
      patients and the controls. The receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed 
      that the T(2) relaxation time of the nerves was best at distinguishing the CIDP 
      patients from the controls (Az  =  0.848). CONCLUSION: Patients with CIDP could be

TI  - Is a single-level measurement of paraspinal muscle fat infiltration and 
      cross-sectional area representative of the entire lumbar spine?
PG  - 939-945
LID - 10.1007/s00256-018-2902-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Lumbar paraspinal muscle morphology has recently been evaluated in several 
      studies with conflicting results. Several studies have performed single-slice 
      evaluations of paraspinal muscle morphology, whereas other studies have done a 
      multi-level assessment; this methodological difference might explain the observed 
      different results. Our study evaluated if a single-slice axial measurement is 
      representative of the entire lumbar musculature. METHODS: We included 80 adult 
      patients who were consecutively evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for 
      spinal symptoms. Using T2-weighted axial images, we measured the fat signal 
      fractions (FSF) and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the erector spinae and multifidus 
      at the five levels of the lumbar spine (from L1-L2 to L5-S1). We used the ANOVA test 
      for repeated measurements (with Bonferroni correction) to compare the FSF and CSA 
      among the levels. RESULTS: Erector spinae showed an increasing FSF from L1-L2 to 
      L5-S1; all erector spinae FSF comparisons among the different levels were 
      significantly different. Multifidus FSF also increased caudally below L2-L3, 
      although significant differences were observed only with two or more levels of 
      distance. The CSA of the erector spinae showed a caudal decrease (L4-L5 and L5-S1 
      being significantly smaller than all the levels above). The CSA of the multifidus 
      showed that all levels exhibited a significantly different area compared to their 
      adjacent level (except L5-S1 compared to L4-L5). CONCLUSIONS: No single-level FSF or 
      CSA is representative of the whole lumbar spine. A standardized multi-level 
      evaluation of the paraspinal musculature should be used in future research.

TI  - Comparison of probabilistic and deterministic fiber tracking of cranial nerves.
PG  - 613-621
LID - 10.3171/2016.8.JNS16363 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE The depiction of cranial nerves (CNs) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      is of great interest in skull base tumor surgery and DTI used with deterministic 
      tracking methods has been reported previously. However, there are still no good 
      methods usable for the elimination of noise from the resulting depictions. The 
      authors have hypothesized that probabilistic tracking could lead to more accurate 
      results, because it more efficiently extracts information from the underlying data. 
      Moreover, the authors have adapted a previously described technique for noise 
      elimination using gradual threshold increases to probabilistic tracking. To evaluate 
      the utility of this new approach, a comparison is provided with this work between 
      the gradual threshold increase method in probabilistic and deterministic tracking of 
      CNs. METHODS Both tracking methods were used to depict CNs II, III, V, and the 
      VII+VIII bundle. Depiction of 240 CNs was attempted with each of the above methods 
      in 30 healthy subjects, which were obtained from 2 public databases: the Kirby 
      repository (KR) and Human Connectome Project (HCP). Elimination of erroneous fibers 
      was attempted by gradually increasing the respective thresholds (fractional 
      anisotropy [FA] and probabilistic index of connectivity [PICo]). The results were 
      compared with predefined ground truth images based on corresponding anatomical 
      scans. Two label overlap measures (false-positive error and Dice similarity 
      coefficient) were used to evaluate the success of both methods in depicting the CN. 
      Moreover, the differences between these parameters obtained from the KR and HCP 
      (with higher angular resolution) databases were evaluated. Additionally, 
      visualization of 10 CNs in 5 clinical cases was attempted with both methods and 
      evaluated by comparing the depictions with intraoperative findings. RESULTS Maximum 
      Dice similarity coefficients were significantly higher with probabilistic tracking 
      (p < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The false-positive error of the last 
      obtained depiction was also significantly lower in probabilistic than in 
      deterministic tracking (p < 0.001). The HCP data yielded significantly better 
      results in terms of the Dice coefficient in probabilistic tracking (p < 0.001, 
      Mann-Whitney U-test) and in deterministic tracking (p = 0.02). The false-positive 
      errors were smaller in HCP data in deterministic tracking (p < 0.001) and showed a 
      strong trend toward significance in probabilistic tracking (p = 0.06). In the 
      clinical cases, the probabilistic method visualized 7 of 10 attempted CNs 
      accurately, compared with 3 correct depictions with deterministic tracking. 
      CONCLUSIONS High angular resolution DTI scans are preferable for the DTI-based 
      depiction of the cranial nerves. Probabilistic tracking with a gradual PICo 
      threshold increase is more effective for this task than the previously described 
      deterministic tracking with a gradual FA threshold increase and might represent a 
      method that is useful for depicting cranial nerves with DTI since it eliminates the 
      erroneous fibers without manual intervention.

AB  - SPG11 mutations lead to heterogeneous neurological phenotypes, but metabolic 
      abnormalities have not yet been explored in this disease. In this study, we 
      investigate whether SPG11 pathogenic variants might affect metabolic regulation, 
      leading to weight changes and if this could relate to hypothalamic damage. In this 
      cross-sectional case-control study, we selected a group of individuals with 
      confirmed SPG11 mutations (n = 20), paired with healthy controls - both groups 
      underwent brain MRI, from which we performed manual hypothalamic segmentation - and 
      patients with Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA), having collected weight and height data for 
      BMI-comparison. In the SPG11 group, we found significantly higher BMI compared to 
      FRDA (p = .034), as well as hypothalamic atrophy compared to controls (p = .030). 
      Volumetric changes were not associated with BMI, age, disease duration or SPRS 
      amongst subjects with SPG11. Therefore, this study presents a new feature in SPG11 
      by characterizing a higher obesity rate in these patients, that could be associated 
      with the hypothalamic atrophy found in this population.

TI  - Incorporating dixon multi-echo fat water separation for novel quantitative 
      magnetization transfer of the human optic nerve in vivo.
PG  - 707-716
LID - 10.1002/mrm.26164 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The optic nerve (ON) represents the sole pathway between the eyes and 
      brain; consequently, diseases of the ON can have dramatic effects on vision. 
      However, quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) applications in the ON have been 
      limited to ex vivo studies, in part because of the fatty connective tissue that 
      surrounds the ON, confounding the magnetization transfer (MT) experiment. Therefore, 
      the aim of this study was to implement a multi-echo Dixon fat-water separation 
      approach to remove the fat component from MT images. METHODS: MT measurements were 
      taken in a single slice of the ON and frontal lobe using a three-echo Dixon readout, 
      and the water and out-of-phase images were applied to a two-pool model in ON tissue 
      and brain white matter to evaluate the effectiveness of using Dixon fat-water 
      separation to remove fatty tissue from MT images. RESULTS: White matter data showed 
      no significant differences between image types; however, there was a significant 
      increase (p < 0.05) in variation in the out-of-phase images in the ON relative to 
      the water images. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that Dixon 
      fat-water separation can be robustly used for accurate MT quantification of 
      anatomies susceptible to partial volume effects resulting from fat. Magn Reson Med

TI  - Histopathology, electrodiagnostic testing, and magnetic resonance imaging show 
      significant peripheral and central nervous system myelin abnormalities in the cat 
      model of alpha-mannosidosis.
PG  - 817-28
AB  - Alpha-mannosidosis is a disease caused by the deficient activity of 
      alpha-mannosidase, a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the degradation of 
      glycoproteins. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of mannose-rich 
      oligosaccharides within lysosomes. The purpose of this study was to characterize the 
      peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) myelin 
      abnormalities in cats from a breeding colony with a uniform mutation in the gene 
      encoding alpha-mannosidase. Three affected cats and 3 normal cats from 2 litters 
      were examined weekly from 4 to 18 wk of age. Progressively worsening neurological 
      signs developed in affected cats that included tremors, loss of balance, and 
      nystagmus. In the PNS, affected cats showed slow motor nerve conduction velocity and 
      increased F-wave latency. Single nerve fiber teasing revealed significant 
      demyelination/remyelination in affected cats. Mean G-ratios of nerves showed a 
      significant increase in affected cats compared to normal cats. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging of the CNS revealed diffuse white matter signal abnormalities throughout the 
      brain of affected cats. Quantitative magnetization transfer imaging showed a 8%-16% 
      decrease in the magnetization transfer ratio in brain white matter of affected cats 
      compared to normal cats, consistent with myelin abnormalities. Histology confirmed 
      myelin loss throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. Thus, histology, 
      electrodiagnostic testing, and magnetic resonance imaging identified significant 
      myelination abnormalities in both the PNS and CNS that have not been described 
      previously in alpha-mannosidosis.

TI  - Gender differences in carpal tunnel relative cross-sectional area: a possible 
      causative factor in idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome.
PG  - 638-42
LID - 10.1177/1753193415625404 [doi]
AB  - Previous research has not established a consistent difference in hand size or carpal 
      tunnel cross-sectional area between patients with and without carpal tunnel 
      syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that there would be no difference in relative 
      carpal tunnel sizes between men and women. We defined relative carpal tunnel size as 
      the cross-sectional areas at the inlet (level of the pisiform) and outlet (level of 
      the hook of the hamate) of the carpal tunnel divided by the length of the capitate 
      (as a measure of hand size). We made the measurements on the magnetic resonance 
      imaging scans of 50 men and 50 women taken for symptoms unrelated to carpal tunnel 
      syndrome. The mean relative cross-sectional area was appreciably smaller in women 
      than men (p < 0.05). This suggests that the carpal tunnel cross-sectional area 
      relative to the size of the hand is constitutionally smaller in women than in men. 
      This could in theory be a significant factor in patients developing carpal tunnel 
      syndrome. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.

TI  - Validation of MRC Centre MRI calf muscle fat fraction protocol as an outcome measure 
      in CMT1A.
PG  - e1125-e1129
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000006214 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To translate the quantitative MRC Centre MRI protocol in 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) to a second site; validate its 
      responsiveness in an independent cohort; and test the benefit of participant 
      stratification to increase outcome measure responsiveness. METHODS: Three healthy 
      volunteers were scanned for intersite standardization. For the longitudinal patient 
      study, 11 patients with CMT1A were recruited with 10 patients rescanned at a 
      12-month interval. Three-point Dixon MRI of leg muscles was performed to generate 
      fat fraction (FF) maps, transferred to a central site for quality control and 
      analysis. Clinical data collected included CMT Neuropathy Score. RESULTS: 
      Test-retest reliability of FF within individual healthy calf muscles at the remote 
      site was excellent: intraclass correlation coefficient 0.79, limits of agreement 
      -0.67 to +0.85 %FF. In patients, mean calf muscle FF was 21.0% and correlated 
      strongly with disease severity and age. Calf muscle FF significantly increased over 
      12 months (+1.8 ± 1.7 %FF, p = 0.009). Patients with baseline FF >10% showed a 
      12-month FF increase of 2.9% ± 1.3% (standardized response mean = 2.19). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We have validated calf muscle FF as an outcome measure in an 
      independent cohort of patients with CMT1A. Responsiveness is significantly improved 
      by enrolling a stratified patient cohort with baseline calf FF >10%.

TI  - Microneurography of human median nerve.
PG  - 826-30
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the possibility of performing high-resolution MRI 
      (microneurography) on peripheral nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A specific radio 
      frequency (RF) coil was developed to probe the human median nerve at a magnetic 
      field strength of 9.4 T and tested on three excised samples by acquiring 
      microneurograms. RESULTS: The microneurograms revealed neuronal tissue constituents 
      at subfascicular level. The contrast features on proton-density and T1- and 
      T2-weighted images were described and compared. The microscopic water movement was 
      quantified using diffusion weighting parallel and orthogonal to the neuronal fiber 
      orientation. The characteristics of anisotropic diffusion in the median nerve were 
      comparable to those reported from other biological tissues (white matter and 
      kidney). CONCLUSION: The results overall suggest that microneurography might provide 
      new noninvasive insights into microscopic gross anatomy of the peripheral nerve, 
      injury evaluation, and efficacy of repair, although the feasibility at current 
      clinically relevant field strengths is yet to be determined.

TI  - Greater occipital nerve infiltration under MR guidance: Feasibility study and 
      preliminary results.
PG  - 886-893
LID - 10.1007/s00330-017-4952-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of greater occipital nerve (GON) intermediate 
      site infiltration with MRI guidance. METHODS: Eleven consecutive patients suffering 
      from chronic refractory cranio-facial pain who underwent 16 GON infiltrations were 
      included in this prospective study. All of the procedures were performed on an 
      outpatient basis in the research facility of our institution, with a 1.5 T scanner. 
      The fatty space between inferior obliquus and semispinalis muscles at C1-C2 level 
      was defined as the target. Technical success was defined as the ability to 
      accurately inject the products at the target, assessed by post-procedure axial and 
      sagittal proton density-weighted sequences. Clinical success was defined as a 50% 
      pain decrease at 1 month. RESULTS: Technical success was 100%. GON was depicted in 
      6/11 cases on planning MRI sequences. Mean duration of procedure was 22.5 min (range 
      16-41). Clinical success was obtained in 7/11 included patients (63.6%) with a mean 
      self-reported improvement of 78%. CONCLUSION: Interventional MR-guidance for GON 
      infiltration is a feasible technique offering similar results to an already 
      established effective procedure. It may appear as a useful tool in specific 
      populations, such as young patients and repeat infiltrations, and should be 
      considered in these settings. KEY POINTS: • MR guidance for GON infiltration is a 
      feasible technique. • Preliminary results are in agreement with other guidance 
      modalities. • MR guidance may be seen as a useful tool in specific populations. •

TI  - Usefulness of muscle denervation as an MRI sign of peripheral nerve pathology.
PG  - 516-26
AB  - Peripheral nerve disorders may be classified into compressive or entrapment 
      neuropathies and non-compressive neuropathies. Muscle denervation recognized on MRI 
      may be a useful sign in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve disorders. Acute or 
      subacute denervation results in prolonged T2 relaxation time, producing increased 
      signal in skeletal muscle on short tau inversion-recovery and fat-suppressed 
      T2-weighted images. Chronic denervation produces fatty atrophy of skeletal muscles, 
      resulting in increased muscle signal on T1-weighted images. This review will outline 
      and illustrate the various ways that muscle denervation as seen on MRI may assist in 
      the diagnosis and localization of peripheral nerve disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are 
      widely used in the evaluation of the central nervous system and recently have been 
      reported as a potential tool for diagnosis of the peripheral nerve or the lumbar 
      nerve entrapment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate consecutive changes in 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of normal 
      lumbar nerve roots from the junction of the dura mater. METHODS: The lumbar spinal 
      nerves were examined in 6 male healthy volunteers (mean age, 35 years) with no 
      experiences of sciatica, with a 3.0-T MR unit using a five-element phased-array 
      surface coil. DTI was performed with the following imaging parameters: 
      11084.6/73.7 ms for TR/TE; b-value, 800 s/mm2; MPG, 33 directions; slice thickness, 
      1.5 mm; and total scan time, 7 min 35 s. ADC and FA values at all consecutive points 
      along the L4, L5 and S1 nerves were quantified on every 1.5 mm slice from the 
      junction of the dura mater using short fiber tracking. RESULTS: ADC values of all 
      L4, 5, and S1 nerve roots decreased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction and 
      was constant distally afterward. ADC values in the proximal portion demonstrated 
      S1 > L5 > L4 (p < 0.05). On the other hand, FA values increased linearly up to 15 mm 
      from the dura junction, and was constant distally afterward. FA values in the 
      proximal portion showed L4 > L5 > S1 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated 
      that ADC and FA values of each L4, 5, and S1 at the proximal portion from the 
      junction of the dura matter changed linearly. It would be useful to know the normal 
      profile of DTI values by location of each nerve root so that we can detect subtle 
      abnormalities in each nerve root.

TI  - A knowledge-based approach for carpal tunnel segmentation from magnetic resonance 
      images.
PG  - 510-20
LID - 10.1007/s10278-012-9530-2 [doi]
AB  - Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) has been reported as one of the most common peripheral 
      neuropathies. Carpal tunnel segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images is 
      important for the evaluation of CTS. To date, manual segmentation, which is 
      time-consuming and operator dependent, remains the most common approach for the 
      analysis of the carpal tunnel structure. Therefore, we propose a new knowledge-based 
      method for automatic segmentation of the carpal tunnel from MR images. The proposed 
      method first requires the segmentation of the carpal tunnel from the most proximally 
      cross-sectional image. Three anatomical features of the carpal tunnel are detected 
      by watershed and polygonal curve fitting algorithms to automatically initialize a 
      deformable model as close to the carpal tunnel in the given image as possible. The 
      model subsequently deforms toward the tunnel boundary based on image intensity 
      information, shape bending degree, and the geometry constraints of the carpal 
      tunnel. After the deformation process, the carpal tunnel in the most proximal image 
      is segmented and subsequently applied to a contour propagation step to extract the 
      tunnel contours sequentially from the remaining cross-sectional images. MR volumes 
      from 15 subjects were included in the validation experiments. Compared with the 
      ground truth of two experts, our method showed good agreement on tunnel 
      segmentations by an average margin of error within 1 mm and dice similarity 
      coefficient above 0.9.

TI  - High-Resolution Axonal Bundle (Fascicle) Assessment and Triple-Echo Steady-State T2 
      Mapping of the Median Nerve at 7 T: Preliminary Experience.
PG  - 529-35
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000265 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this preliminary study were to determine the number of 
      axonal bundles (fascicles) in the median nerve, using a high-resolution, proton 
      density (PD)-turbo spin echo (TSE) fat suppression sequence, and to determine 
      normative T2 values, measured by triple-echo steady state, of the median nerve in 
      healthy volunteers and in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), at 
      7 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the local ethics 
      committee and conducted between March 2014 and January 2015. All study participants 
      gave written informed consent. Six healthy volunteers (30 ± 12 years) and 5 patients 
      with CTS (44 ± 16 years) were included. Measurements were performed on both wrists 
      in all volunteers and on the affected wrist in patients (3 right, 2 left). Based on 
      5-point scales, 2 readers assessed image quality (1, very poor; 5, very good) and 
      the presence of artifacts that might have a possible influence on fascicle 
      determination (1, severe artifacts; 5, no artifacts) and counted the number of 
      fascicles independently on the PD-TSE sequences. Furthermore, T2 values by region of 
      interest analysis were assessed. Student t tests, a hierarchic linear model, and 
      intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used for statistical analysis. 
      RESULTS: Proton density-TSE image quality and artifacts revealed a median of 5 in 
      healthy volunteers and 4 in patients with CTS for both readers. Fascicle count of 
      the median nerve ranged from 13 to 23 in all subjects, with an ICC of 0.87 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.95). T2 values were significantly higher (P = 
      0.023) in patients (24.27 ± 0.97 milliseconds [95% CI, 22.19-26.38]) compared with 
      healthy volunteers (21.01 ± 0.65 milliseconds [95% CI, 19.61-22.41]). The ICC for 
      all T2 values was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the 
      possibility of fascicle determination of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and 
      patients with CTS (although probably less accurately) with high-resolution 7 T 
      magnetic resonance imaging, as well as significantly higher T2 values in patients 
      with CTS, which seems to be associated with pathophysiological nerve changes.

TI  - Bridging the Gap: Engineered Porcine-derived Urinary Bladder Matrix Conduits as a 
      Novel Scaffold for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration.
PG  - S328-S334
LID - 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001042 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to compare engineered nerve conduits constructed from 
      porcine-derived urinary bladder matrix (UBM) with the criterion-standard nerve 
      autografts, for segmental loss peripheral nerve repairs. METHODS: Forty-eight 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups. All underwent a 10-mm sciatic nerve 
      gap injury. This was repaired using either (1) reverse autograft-the 10-mm cut 
      segment was oriented 180 degrees and used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps or 
      (2) UBM conduit-the 10-mm nerve gap was bridged with UBM conduit. Behavior 
      assessments such as sciatic function index and foot fault asymmetry scores were 
      performed weekly. At 3- or 6-week time endpoints, the repaired nerves and bilateral 
      gastrocnemius/soleus muscles were harvested from each animal. Nerves were evaluated 
      using immunohistochemistry for motor and sensory axon staining and with diffusion 
      tensor imaging. The net wet muscle weights were calculated to assess the degree of 
      muscle atrophy. RESULTS: The UBM group demonstrated significantly improved foot 
      fault asymmetry scores at 2 and 4 weeks, whereas there was no difference in sciatic 
      function index. The net muscle weights were similar between both groups. Motor axon 
      counts proximal/inside/distal to the conduit/graft were similar between UBM conduits 
      and reverse autografts, whereas sensory axon counts within and distal to the conduit 
      were significantly higher than those of the autograft at 6 weeks. Sensory axonal 
      regeneration seemed to be adherent to the inner surface of the UBM conduit, whereas 
      it had a scattered appearance in autografts. Diffusion tensor imaging parameters 
      between groups were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary bladder matrix conduits prove to 
      be at least similar to nerve autografts for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries 
      with a short gap. The matrix perhaps serves as a scaffold to augment sensory nerve 
      growth. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In a clinical setting, UBM may eliminate the donor site 
      morbidity and increased operative time associated with nerve autografting.

TI  - Virtual reality-based simulator for training in regional anaesthesia.
PG  - 594-600
LID - 10.1093/bja/aep224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The safe performance of regional anaesthesia (RA) requires theoretical 
      knowledge and good manual skills. Virtual reality (VR)-based simulators may offer 
      trainees a safe environment to learn and practice different techniques. However, 
      currently available VR simulators do not consider individual anatomy, which limits 
      their use for realistic training. We have developed a VR-based simulator that can be 
      used for individual anatomy and for different anatomical regions. METHODS: 
      Individual data were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic 
      resonance angiography (MRA) without contrast agent to represent morphology and the 
      vascular system, respectively. For data handling, registration, and segmentation, an 
      application based on the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit was developed. Suitable 
      segmentation algorithms such as the fuzzy c-means clustering approach were 
      integrated, and a hierarchical tree data structure was created to model the flexible 
      anatomical structures of peripheral nerve cords. The simulator was implemented in 
      the VR toolkit ViSTA using modules for collision detection, virtual humanoids, 
      interaction, and visualization. A novel algorithm for electric impulse transmission 
      is the core of the simulation. RESULTS: In a feasibility study, MRI morphology and 
      MRA were acquired from five subjects for the inguinal region. From these sources, 
      three-dimensional anatomical data sets were created and nerves modelled. The 
      resolution obtained from both MRI and MRA was sufficient for realistic simulations. 
      Our high-fidelity simulator application allows trainees to perform virtual 
      peripheral nerve blocks based on these data sets and models. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Subject-specific training of RA is supported in a virtual environment. We have 
      adapted segmentation algorithms and developed a VR-based simulator for the inguinal 
      region for use in training for different peripheral nerve blocks. In contrast to 
      available VR-based simulators, our simulation offers anatomical variety.

TI  - Directional axonal regrowth induced by an aligned fibrin nanofiber hydrogel 
      contributes to improved motor function recovery in canine L2 spinal cord injury.
PG  - 40
LID - 10.1007/s10856-020-06375-9 [doi]
AB  - Spinal cord injuries (SCI) normally disrupt the long axonal tracts of the spinal 
      cord and cause permanent neurological deficits, for which there is currently a lack 
      of effective therapeutic methods. Biomaterial-based regenerative medicine is a 
      pivotal strategy to induce axonal regeneration through delivery of biophysical 
      and/or biochemical regulatory cues by biomaterials. We previously fabricated a 
      hierarchically aligned fibrin hydrogel (AFG) that could promote neurogenic 
      differentiation of stem cells in vitro and has been successfully applied for 
      peripheral nerve and spinal cord regeneration in rats. In this study, AFG was used 
      to repair a canine lumbar segment 2 hemisection spinal cord injury, and the 
      consistency of histological, imageological and behavioral results was compared. AFG 
      was used to construct an aligned fiber bridge that supported cell adhesion in vitro 
      and rapidly facilitated tissue invasion along the long axis of fibers in vivo, 
      Moreover, in vivo results demonstrated regrowth of axons in an oriented pattern 
      connecting the rostral and caudal stumps. Consistent results were confirmed by 
      diffusion tensor imaging, which allowed successful tracing of reconnected nerve 
      fibers across the defect. As a result, directional axonal regrowth contributed to 
      significantly improved recovery of motor functional behavior of SCI canines with AFG 
      implantation. Our results suggest that AFG has great promise for rapidly directing 
      axonal regrowth for nerve regeneration.

TI  - Initial findings in traumatic peripheral nerve injury and repair with diffusion 
      tensor imaging.
PG  - 332-347
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51270 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Management of peripheral nerve injuries requires physicians to rely on 
      qualitative measures from patient history, electromyography, and physical exam. 
      Determining a successful nerve repair can take months to years for proximal 
      injuries, and the resulting delays in clinical decision-making can lead to a 
      negative impact on patient outcomes. Early identification of a failed nerve repair 
      could prevent permanent muscle atrophy and loss of function. This study aims to test 
      the feasibility of performing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate injury and 
      recovery following repair of wrist trauma. We hypothesize that DTI provides a 
      noninvasive and reliable assessment of regeneration, which may improve clinical 
      decision-making and alter the clinical course of surgical interventions. METHODS: 
      Clinical and MRI measurements from subjects with traumatic peripheral nerve injury, 
      carpal tunnel syndrome, and healthy control subjects were compared to evaluate the 
      relationship between DTI metrics and injury severity. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy 
      from DTI was sensitive to differences between damaged and healthy nerves, damaged 
      and compressed nerves, and injured and healthy contralateral nerves. Longitudinal 
      measurements in two injury subjects also related to clinical outcomes. Implications 
      of other diffusion measures are also discussed. INTERPRETATION: DTI is a sensitive 
      tool for wrist nerve injuries and can be utilized for monitoring nerve recovery. 
      Across three subjects with nerve injuries, this study has shown how DTI can detect 
      abnormalities between injured and healthy nerves, measure recovery, and determine if 
      re-operation was successful. Additional comparisons to carpal tunnel syndrome and 
      healthy nerves show that DTI is sensitive to the degree of impairment.

TI  - The plasticity of the corticospinal tract in children with obstetric brachial plexus

AB  - Botulinum neurotoxin A (BTX-A) intervention has long-term benefits for children with 
      obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP). Although cortical plasticity has been widely 
      studied, plasticity in white matter has not received as much attention. Here, six 
      children with OBPP underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before and 6 months after BTX-A treatment. Surface 
      electromyography (EMG) was recorded. The aim was to investigate changes in the 
      corticospinal tract (CST) as an example longitudinal observation of white matter 
      plasticity. Deterministic fiber tracking with a Fiber Assignment by Continuous 
      Tracking algorithm was used to reconstruct the CST. Fiber tracts passing through a 
      region of interest (ROI) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and a target 
      ROI in the upper-limb representation of M1 (defined by task-related fMRI) were 
      selected as the CST. Motor performances were improved while EMG showed no 
      significant difference 6 months after the treatment. We observed a significant 
      increase in mean fractional anisotropy and a significant decrease in fiber number 
      after treatment. We analyzed the correlations between DTI metrics and clinical motor 
      assessments. Although the correlation results were not statistically significant, 
      they support the notion that BTX-A treatment causes white matter plasticity and has 
      a positive long-term outcome. Peripheral deafferentation may lead to altered 
      information flow, resulting in the positive adaptation of white matter. This study 
      provides novel insight into cerebral plasticity following peripheral nerve 
      regeneration and indicates that a combination of relatively non-invasive therapies 
      can accelerate plasticity of sensorimotor circuits and promote functional recovery 
      in OBPP.

TI  - Supratentorial and pontine MRI abnormalities characterize recessive spastic ataxia 
      of Charlevoix-Saguenay. A comprehensive study of an Italian series.
PG  - 138-46
LID - 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2012.03815.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of 
      Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      mutations in the SACS gene. The disease, first described in Canadian families from 
      Québec, is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract involvement and 
      peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: Analysis of SACS gene allowed the identification of 
      14 patients with ARSACS from 13 unrelated Italian families. Clinical phenotype, gene 
      mutations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were analysed. RESULTS: We 
      found 16 novel SACS gene mutations, including a large in-frame deletion. The age at 
      onset was in infancy, but one patient presented the first symptoms at age 32. 
      Progression of the disease was variable, and increased muscle tone was mostly 
      recognized in later stages. Structural MRI showed atrophy of the superior cerebellar 
      vermis, a bulky pons exhibiting T2-hypointense stripes, identified as the 
      corticospinal tract (CST), thinning of the corpus callosum and a rim of 
      T2-hyperintensity around the thalami in 100% of cases. The presence of iron or other 
      paramagnetic substances was excluded. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed 
      grossly over-represented transverse pontine fibres (TPF), which prevented 
      reconstruction of the CST at this level (100% of cases). In all patients, 
      significant microstructural alterations were found in the supratentorial white 
      matter of forceps, cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings further enlarge the genetic spectrum of SACS mutations and widen the study 
      of clinical phenotype. MRI characteristics indicate that pontine changes and 
      supratentorial abnormalities are diagnostic. The over-representation of TPF on DTI 
      suggests a developmental component in the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  - Combination of Mn(2+)-enhanced and diffusion tensor MR imaging gives complementary 
      information about injury and regeneration in the adult rat optic nerve.
PG  - 39-51
LID - 10.1002/jmri.21606 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate manganese (Mn(2+))-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) and diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) as tools for detection of axonal injury and regeneration after 
      intravitreal peripheral nerve graft (PNG) implantation in the rat optic nerve (ON). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In adult Fischer rats, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival 
      was evaluated in Flurogold (FG) back-filled retinal whole mounts after ON crush 
      (ONC), intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl(2) injection (150 nmol) at 0 and 20 
      days post lesion (dpl). MEMRI and echo-planar DTI (DTI-EPI) was obtained of 
      noninjured ON one day after intravitreal MnCl(2) injection, and at 1 and 21 dpl 
      after ONC, intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl(2) injections given at 0 and 20 
      dpl. GAP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed after the last MRI. RESULTS: ONC 
      reduced RGC density in retina by 94% at 21 dpl compared to noninjured ON without 
      MnCl(2) injections. Both intravitreal PNG and intravitreal MnCl(2) injections 
      improved RGC survival in retina, which was reduced by 90% (ONC+MnCl(2)), 82% 
      (ONC+PNG), and 74% (ONC+PNG+MnCl(2)) compared to noninjured ON. DTI-derived 
      parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity lambda( 
      parallel), and radial diffusivity lambda( perpendicular)) were unaffected by the 
      presence of Mn(2+) in the ON. At 1 dpl, CNR(MEMRI) and lambda( parallel) were 
      reduced at the injury site, while at 21 dpl they were increased at the injury site 
      compared to values measured at 1 dpl. GAP-43 immunoreactive axons were present in 
      the ON distal to the ONC injury site. CONCLUSION: MEMRI and DTI enabled detection of 
      functional and structural degradation after rat ON injury, and there was correlation 
      between the MRI-derived and immunohistochemical measures of axon regeneration.

TI  - A longitudinal DTI and histological study of the spinal cord reveals early 
      pathological alterations in G93A-SOD1 mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
      selective motor neuron degeneration in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. 
      It is generally accepted that ALS is caused by death of motor neurons, however the 
      exact temporal cascade of degenerative processes is not yet completely known. To 
      identify the early pathological changes in spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 ALS mice we 
      performed a comprehensive longitudinal analysis employing diffusion-tensor magnetic 
      resonance imaging alongside histology and electron microscopy, in parallel with 
      peripheral nerve histology. We showed the gradient of degeneration appearance in 
      spinal cord white and gray matter, starting earliest in the ventral white matter, 
      due to a cascade of pathological events including axon dysfunction and mitochondrial 
      changes. Notably, we found that even the main sensory regions are affected by the 
      neurodegenerative process at symptomatic disease phase. Overall our results attest 
      the applicability of DTI in determining disease progression in ALS mice. These 
      findings suggest that DTI could be potentially adapted in humans to aid the 
      assessment of ALS progression and eventually the evaluation of treatment efficacy.

TI  - Assessment of cochlear nerve deficiency and its effect on normal maturation of 
      auditory tract by diffusion kurtosis imaging and diffusion tensor imaging: A 
      correlational approach.
PG  - 1305-1313
LID - S0730-725X(16)30089-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.mri.2016.07.010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) was evaluated in assessing cochlear nerve deficiency (CND) and its effect on 
      normal maturation of auditory tract. METHODS: 25 CND patients and 25 controls (age 
      matched: 2months to 17years, gender matched) were evaluated by mean kurtosis (MK), 
      axial kurtosis, and radial kurtosis and compared against fractional anisotropy (FA), 
      axial and radial diffusivities in internal auditory canal (IAC), lateral lemniscus 
      (LL) and inferior colliculus (IC). The age related changes of auditory tract were 
      studied through Pearson correlation between estimated indices and age of both CND 
      and control populations. RESULTS: Significant loss of MK (IAC: 10.71%, IC: 10.87%, 
      LL: 15.63%) was observed in CND cases as against moderate reduction in FA (IAC: 
      8.57%, IC: 10%, LL: 7.69%) in all three anatomical locations. Similarly, substantial 
      decline is observed in radial kurtosis (IAC: 27.03%, IC: 33.33%, LL: 31.43%) in 
      comparison to moderate increase in radial diffusivity (IAC: 13.46%, IC: 24.39%, LL: 
      24%) in CND cases. No statistically significant change was seen in both axial 
      kurtosis and diffusivities. In control populations, MK (r=0.473, p=0.011) and radial 
      kurtosis (r=0.418, p=0.016) correlate positively with age and had no correlation in 
      case of CND cases. FA (r=0.356, p=0.019) minimally correlated with age in control 
      population but showed no statistically significant correlation in CND cases 
      (r=0.198, p=0.036). CONCLUSION: DKI metrics performed better than DTI in assessing 
      microstructural changes of CND. In particular, MK and radial kurtosis are found to 
      be more sensitive enough to differentiate the normal maturation of cochlear nerve 
      from CND cases.

PG  - 142-53
LID - 10.1016/j.clinph.2011.05.028 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation during 
      somatosensory electrical stimulation of the median nerve in acute stroke patients 
      and to determine its correlation with ischemic damage and clinical recovery over 
      time. METHODS: Fourteen acute stroke patients underwent functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) during contralesional median-nerve electrical stimulation 
      12-48 h after stroke. Findings were then validated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      and motor evoked potential by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). RESULTS: Poor 
      clinical recovery at three months was noted in four patients with no activation in 
      the early days after stroke, whereas good clinical recovery was observed in eight 
      patients with a normal activation pattern in the primary sensory motor area in the 
      acute phase. In two patients BOLD activation correlated weakly with clinical 
      recovery. Findings from TMS and DTI partially correlated with clinical recovery and 
      functional scores. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant insights into the "functional 
      reserve" of stroke patients gained with peripheral nerve stimulation during fMRI may 
      carry prognostic value already in the acute period of a cerebrovascular accident. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: BOLD activation maps could provide insights into the functional 
      organization of the residual systems and could contribute to medical decision making 
      in neurological and rehabilitative treatment.

TI  - Diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy of transient cerebral 
      white matter lesions in X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
PG  - 178-80
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.01.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a common inherited axonal 
      or mixed axonal-demyelinating neuropathy. The disease is caused by mutations in the 
      GJB1 gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin32, which is expressed in both 
      Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central 
      nervous system. Several reports have described CMTX patients presenting with 
      transient and recurrent central nervous system (CNS) symptoms with transient white 
      matter lesions in the brain. PATIENTS: We describe a man with CMTX who presented 
      with transient CNS symptoms and abnormal cerebral white matter lesions in MRI. He 
      was subjected to a detailed MRI examination using two specialized techniques, 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). RESULTS: 
      In the early stage of his CNS symptoms, MRS studies revealed reduced 
      N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) levels in deep white matter, and DTI revealed reduced 
      fractional anisotropy within lesions. Interestingly, these reductions began to 
      recover from day 19 after admission, and follow-up DTI and MRS studies on day 101 
      revealed a reversal of the abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The findings of reversible 
      reductions in fractional anisotropy and NAA levels in our patient suggest reversible 
      axonal damage associated with deficient oligodendrocyte gap junctions.

TI  - Spinal-cord involvement in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
PG  - 35-6
AB  - The pathogenesis of diabetic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP) is poorly 
      understood but there is some evidence that the disease process might extend beyond 
      peripheral nerves. We used magnetic-resonance imaging to measure spinal-cord 
      cross-sectional area in diabetic patients with and without DSP and in healthy 
      controls. There were significant differences in cord area between the groups at C4/5 
      and T3/4 (p=0.004 and p=0.033, respectively), with a smaller cord area in those with 
      DSP compared with controls (p=0.001 and p=0.016 for C4/5 and T3/4, respectively). 
      These results indicate that DSP is not simply a disease of the peripheral nerve and 
      that there is substantial involvement of the spinal cord.

TI  - Nondermatomal somatosensory deficits in chronic pain are associated with cerebral 
      grey matter changes.
PG  - 227-238
LID - 10.3109/15622975.2015.1073356 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Widespread sensory deficits occur in 20-40% of chronic pain patients on 
      the side of pain, independent of pain aetiology, and are known as nondermatomal 
      sensory deficits (NDSDs). NDSDs can occur in absence of central or peripheral 
      nervous system lesions. We hypothesised that NDSDs were associated with cerebral 
      grey matter changes in the sensory system and in pain processing regions, detectable 
      with voxel-based morphometry. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with NDSDs, 23 patients 
      without NDSDs ("pain-only"), and 29 healthy controls were studied with high 
      resolution structural MRI of the brain. A comprehensive clinical and psychiatric 
      evaluation based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual was performed in all patients. 
      RESULTS: Patients with NDSDs and "pain-only" did not differ concerning demographic 
      data and psychiatric diagnoses, although anxiety scores (HADS-A) were higher in 
      patients with NDSDs. In patients with NDSDs, grey matter increases were found in the 
      right primary sensory cortex, thalamus, and bilaterally in lateral temporal regions 
      and the hippocampus/fusiform gyrus. "Pain-only" patients showed a bilateral grey 
      matter increase in the posterior insula and less pronounced changes in sensorimotor 
      cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunctional sensory processing in patients with NDSDs is 
      associated with complex changes in grey matter volume, involving the somatosensory 
      system and temporal regions.

TI  - Structural brain abnormalities are related to retinal nerve fiber layer thinning and 
      disease duration in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.
PG  - 1189-97
LID - 10.1177/1352458513519838 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is widely expressed in the human brain 
      cortex, lesions are rare in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorders (NMOSD). 
      Recently, however, several studies have demonstrated occult structural brain atrophy 
      in NMO. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      patterns of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) abnormalities in patients with 
      NMOSD and to assess the visual pathway integrity during disease duration correlation 
      of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and pericalcarine cortex thickness. METHODS: 
      Twenty-one patients with NMOSD and 34 matched healthy controls underwent both 
      high-field MRI (3T) high-resolution T1-weighted and diffusion-tensor MRI. 
      Voxel-based morphometry, cortical analyses (Freesurfer) and diffusion-tensor imaging 
      (DTI) analyses (TBSS-FSL) were used to investigate brain abnormalities. In addition, 
      RNFL measurement by optic-coherence tomography (OCT) was performed. RESULTS: We 
      demonstrate that NMOSD is associated with GM and WM atrophy, encompassing more 
      frequently the motor, sensory and visual pathways, and that the extent of GM atrophy 
      correlates with disease duration. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time a 
      correlation between RNFL and pericalcarine cortical thickness, with cortical atrophy 
      evolving over the course of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a role for 
      retrograde and anterograde neurodegeneration in GM atrophy in NMOSD. However, the 
      presence atrophy encompassing almost all lobes suggests that additional 
      pathomechanisms might also be involved.

TI  - Reliability and reproducibility of sciatic nerve magnetization transfer imaging and 
      T2 relaxometry.
LID - 10.1007/s00330-021-08072-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the interreader and test-retest reliability of magnetization 
      transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry in sciatic nerve MR neurography (MRN). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 21 healthy volunteers were 
      examined three times on separate days by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 Tesla, 
      consisting of an MTI sequence, a multi-echo T2 relaxometry sequence, and a 
      high-resolution T2-weighted sequence. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), T2 
      relaxation time, and proton spin density (PSD) of the sciatic nerve were assessed by 
      two independent observers, and both interreader and test-retest reliability for all 
      readout parameters were reported by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and 
      standard error of measurement (SEM). RESULTS: For the sciatic nerve, overall mean ± 
      standard deviation MTR was 26.75 ± 3.5%, T2 was 64.54 ± 8.2 ms, and PSD was 340.93 ± 
      78.8. ICCs ranged between 0.81 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for interreader reliability and 
      between 0.75 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for test-retest reliability. SEM for interreader 
      reliability was 1.7% for MTR, 2.67 ms for T2, and 21.3 for PSD. SEM for test-retest 
      reliability was 1.7% for MTR, 2.66 ms for T2, and 20.1 for PSD. CONCLUSIONS: MTI and 
      T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve are reliable and reproducible. The values of 
      measurement imprecision reported here may serve as a guide for correct 
      interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies. KEY POINTS: • 
      Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve are 
      reliable and reproducible. • The imprecision that is unavoidably associated with 
      different scans or different readers can be estimated by the here presented SEM 
      values for the biomarkers T2, PSD, and MTR. • These values may serve as a guide for 
      correct interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies and possible 
      clinical applications.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that combining nerve conduits with neural stem cells 
      or growth factors can repair peripheral nerve injury in rodents. However, nerve 
      damage does occur with longer gaps in human than in rodents, thus findings from 
      rodent studies are difficult to translate to clinical practice. Minipigs have a 
      longer gap that is more closely applicable to the challenge of human nerve grafting 
      in extensive traumatic nerve damage. In this study, human amniotic fluid stem cells 
      (AFSCs) and polylactate nerve conduits were used to repair sciatic nerve injury in 
      minipigs. The AFSCs exhibited the properties of mesenchymal stem cells with a 
      propensity toward neural stem cells. Measurements of compound muscle action 
      potential implied that administration of conduits with AFSCs was beneficial in 
      function recovery in the minipig model compared with conduits alone. The results of 
      diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) based fiber tractography assay in 
      the minipig model suggest that combining AFSCs with conduits could expedite the 
      repair of sciatic nerve injury. Further, MR-based DTI provides an effective and 
      non-invasive method to visualize the sciatic nerve and to monitor the regeneration 
      progress of injured nerve in a longitudinal study.

TI  - DTI metrics can be used as biomarkers to determine the therapeutic effect of stem

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics as 
      biomarkers for the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in acute 
      peripheral nerve injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four adult rats received 
      subepineurial microinjection of MSCs (n = 22) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 
      n = 22) 1 week after the sciatic nerve trunk crush injury. Sequential fat-suppressed 
      T2-weighted imaging, T2 measurement, DTI and sciatic nerve functional assessment 
      were performed at a 3.0 Tesla MR unit over an 8-week follow-up, with histological 
      assessments performed at regular intervals. The sciatic nerve function index, T2 
      value, and DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, 
      radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity values of the distal stumps of crushed 
      nerves were measured and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Nerves treated 
      with MSCs showed better functional recovery and exhibited more pronounced nerve 
      regeneration compared with nerves treated with PBS. T2 values in nerves treated with 
      MSCs or PBS showed a similar change pattern (P = 0.174), while FA and RD values in 
      nerves treated with MSCs showed more rapid return (one week earlier) to baseline 
      level than nerves treated with PBS (P = 0.045; 0.035). Nerves treated with MSCs had 
      higher FA and lower RD values than nerves treated with PBS during the period from 2 
      to 3 weeks after surgery (P ≤ 0.0001, 0.004; P = 0.004, 0.006). CONCLUSION: FA and 
      RD values derived from DTI might be used as sensitive biomarkers for detecting the 
      therapeutic effect of stem cells in acute peripheral nerve crush injuries. LEVEL OF

TI  - Radiographic analysis of cochlear nerve vascular compression.
PG  - 356-61
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We analyzed whether radiographically demonstrated anterior inferior 
      cerebellar artery (AICA) vascular compression of the cochleovestibular nerve in 
      asymmetric hearing loss could be correlated to either the symptomatic ear or to 
      cochlear nerve diameter. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case-control study in 
      which patients were enrolled into a database if audiometry demonstrated asymmetry of 
      20 dB at one frequency, asymmetry of 10 dB at two frequencies, or a difference of 
      20% on word recognition scores. If AICA vascular contact was demonstrated on 
      subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the cerebellopontine angle, patients were 
      included in the study. Patients with vestibular schwannoma or Meniere's disease were 
      excluded. The AICA contact was graded by a blinded neuroradiologist according to 
      criteria proposed by McDermott et al. The cross-sectional area of the cochlear nerve 
      was measured. RESULTS: Symptomatic ears could be correlated to a decreased cochlear 
      nerve diameter, but not to the degree of AICA penetration into the internal auditory 
      canal. CONCLUSIONS: AICA vascular compression of the cochleovestibular nerve does 
      not appear to correlate to hearing loss or to cochlear nerve diameter. The finding 
      of decreased cochlear nerve diameter in symptomatic ears implies an alternative 
      mechanism for asymmetric hearing loss.

TI  - Assessment of tibial and common peroneal nerves in diabetic peripheral neuropathy by 
      diffusion tensor imaging: a case control study.
PG  - 3523-3531
LID - 10.1007/s00330-016-4698-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and interobserver performance of 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and detect 
      correlations with electrophysiology. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers (controls) 
      and ten DPN patients were enrolled to undergo MR examinations. Fractional anisotropy 
      (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of tibial nerve (TN) and common 
      peroneal nerve (CPN) were measured. Unpaired t test and Levene tests were performed 
      to assess differences between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic 
      (ROC) analysis was performed for FA and ADC values. Pearson correlation coefficient 
      was used to assess the correlation between DTI and electrophysiology parameters in 
      the patient group. RESULTS: The FA values of TN and CPN in the DPN group were 
      significantly lower and ADC were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). 
      Interobserver agreement was excellent. FA positively correlated and ADC negatively 
      correlated with motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) (p < 0.05). There were no 
      significant differences between motor nerve conduction amplitude and DTI parameters 
      (p > 0.05). Moderate diagnostic accuracy of DTI was seen in the diagnosis of DPN. 
      CONCLUSIONS: DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy and excellent 
      interobserver performance in the detection of DPN involving the TN and CPN. There is 
      moderate correlation with MCV. KEY POINTS: • FA values of TN and CPN are 
      significantly lower in DPN. • ADC values of TN and CPN are significantly higher in 
      DPN. • DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy in detection of DPN. • There is 
      excellent interobserver performance in DTI measurements. • Moderate correlation is 
      seen between DTI parameters and MCV.

TI  - Imaging signatures of altered brain responses in small-fiber neuropathy: reduced 
      functional connectivity of the limbic system after peripheral nerve degeneration.
PG  - 904-916
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000128 [doi]
AB  - Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is hallmarked by degeneration of small unmyelinated 
      peripheral nerve fibers in the skin. Traditionally, it has been considered as a pure 
      disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, previous work found that 
      dysfunction of skin nerves led to abnormal recruitment of pain-related regions, 
      suggesting that the brain may be affected in SFN. This report combined structural 
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify structural and functional 
      changes in the brain of 19 patients with SFN compared with 17 healthy controls. We 
      applied tensor-based morphometry to detect brain structural alterations in SFN. 
      Greater volume reduction in pain-processing regions, particularly the bilateral 
      anterior cingulate cortices (ACCs), was associated with greater depletion of 
      intraepidermal nerve fibers, a pathological biomarker of skin nerve degeneration. 
      Based on the hypothesis that structural alterations in the pain-processing regions 
      might impair their functional connectivity, we further applied psychophysiological 
      interaction analysis to assess functional connectivity of the ACCs during noxious 
      heat stimulation. There was significant reduction in functional connectivity from 
      the ACCs to the limbic areas (the parahippocampal gyrus and the posterior cingulate 
      cortex), pain-processing area (the insula), and visuospatial areas (the cuneus). 
      Moreover, the degree of reduction in functional connectivity for the ACC to the 
      amygdala and the precuneus was linearly correlated with the severity of 
      intraepidermal nerve fiber depletion. Our findings suggest that SFN is not a pure 
      peripheral nervous system disorder. The pain-related brain networks tend to break 
      into functionally independent components, with severity linked to the degree of skin 
      nerve degeneration.

AB  - AIM: To visualize cranial nerves (CNs) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with 
      special parameters. This study also involved the evaluation of preoperative 
      estimates and intraoperative confirmation of the relationship between nerves and 
      tumor by verifying the accuracy of visualization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 3T magnetic 
      resonance imaging scans including 3D-FSPGR, FIESTA, and DTI were used to collect 
      information from 18 patients with skull base tumor. DTI data were integrated into 
      the 3D slicer for fiber tracking and overlapped anatomic images to determine course 
      of nerves. 3D reconstruction of tumors was achieved to perform neighboring, 
      encasing, and invading relationship between lesion and nerves. RESULTS: Optic 
      pathway including the optic chiasm could be traced in cases of tuberculum sellae 
      meningioma and hypophysoma (pituitary tumor). The oculomotor nerve, from the 
      interpeduncular fossa out of the brain stem to supraorbital fissure, was clearly 
      visible in parasellar meningioma cases. Meanwhile, cisternal parts of trigeminal 
      nerve and abducens nerve, facial nerve were also imaged well in vestibular 
      schwannomas and petroclival meningioma cases. The 3D-spatial relationship between 
      CNs and skull base tumor estimated preoperatively by tumor modeling and tractography 
      corresponded to the results determined during surgery. CONCLUSION: Supported by DTI 
      and 3D slicer, preoperative 3D reconstruction of most CNs related to skull base 
      tumor is feasible in pathological circumstances. We consider DTI Technology to be a 
      useful tool for predicting the course and location of most CNs, and syntopy between 
      them and skull base tumor.

TI  - Stereoscopic Display of the Peripheral Nerves at the Elbow Region Based on MR 
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging with Multiple Post-Processing Methods.
PG  - e22144

LID - e22144
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerves at the elbow region are prone to entrapment 
      neuropathies and injuries. To make accurate assessment, clinicians need stereoscopic 
      display of the nerves to observe them at all angles. OBJECTIVES: To obtain a 
      stereoscopic display of the peripheral nerves at the elbow region based on magnetic 
      resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using three post-processing 
      methods of volume rendering (VR), maximum intensity projection (MIP), and fiber 
      tractography, and to evaluate the difference and correlation between them. SUBJECTS 
      AND METHODS: Twenty-four elbows of 12 healthy young volunteers were assessed by 20 
      encoding diffusion direction MR DTI scans. Images belonging to a single direction 
      (anterior-posterior direction, perpendicular to the nerve) were subjected to VR and 
      MIP reconstruction. All raw DTI data were transferred to the Siemens MR workstation 
      for fiber tractography post-processing. Imaging qualities of fiber tractography and 
      VR/MIP were evaluated by two observers independently based on a custom evaluation 
      scale. RESULTS: Stereoscopic displays of the nerves were obtained in all 24 elbows 
      by VR, MIP, and fiber tractography post-processing methods. The VR/MIP 
      post-processing methods were easier to perform compared to fiber tractography. There 
      was no significant difference among the scores of fiber tracking and VR/MIP 
      reconstruction for single direction. The imaging quality scores of fiber 
      tractography and VR/MIP were significantly correlated based on intraclass 
      correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis (ICC ranged 0.709 - 0.901), which suggested 
      that the scores based on fiber tractography and VR/MIP for the same sample were 
      consistent. Inter- and intraobserver agreements were good to excellent. CONCLUSION: 
      Stereoscopic displays of the peripheral nerves at the elbow region can be achieved 
      by using VR, MIP, and fiber tracking post-processing methods based on raw DTI 
      images. VR and MIP reconstruction could be used as preview tools before fiber 
      tracking to determine whether the raw images are satisfactory.

TI  - Piriformis muscle syndrome with assessment of sciatic nerve using diffusion tensor 
      imaging and tractography: a case report.
PG  - 1399-1404
LID - 10.1007/s00256-017-2690-x [doi]
AB  - Piriformis muscle syndrome (PMS) is difficult to diagnose by objective evaluation of 
      sciatic nerve injury. Here we report a case of PMS diagnosed by diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) and tractography of the sciatic nerve, which can assess and visualize 
      the extent of nerve injury. The patient was a 53-year-old man with a 2-year history 
      of continuous pain and numbness in the left leg. His symptoms worsened when sitting. 
      Physical examination, including sensorimotor neurologic tests, the deep tendon 
      reflex test, and the straight leg raise test, revealed no specific findings. The hip 
      flexion adduction and internal rotation test and resisted contraction maneuvers for 
      the piriformis muscle were positive. There were no abnormal findings on magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine. The transverse diameter of piriformis 
      muscle was slightly thicker in affected side on MRI of the pelvis. A single DTI 
      sequence was performed during MRI of the pelvis. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the 
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the sciatic nerve were quantified at three 
      levels using the fiber-tracking method. FA values were significantly lower and ADC 
      values were significantly higher distal to the piriformis muscle. We performed 
      endoscopic-assisted resection of the piriformis tendon. Intraoperatively, the 
      motor-evoked potentials in the left gastrocnemius were improved by resection of the 
      piriformis tendon. The patient's symptoms improved immediately after surgery. There 
      was no significant difference in FA or ADC at any level between the affected side 
      and the unaffected side 3 months postoperatively. MRI-DTI may aid the diagnosis of 
      PMS.

TI  - The Diagnostic Value of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Posttraumatic Trigeminal 
      Neuropathic Pain.
PG  - 35-40
LID - 10.11607/ofph.2732 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the diagnostic value of non-nerve-selective MRI sequences in 
      posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain (PTNP). METHODS: This study 
      retrospectively analyzed all MRI protocols performed between February 2, 2012 and 
      June 20, 2018 commissioned by the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, 
      University Hospitals Leuven. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic data were 
      extracted from the records of patients with an MRI in the context of PTNP. A 
      contingency table was constructed based on the opinions of the treating physician 
      and the radiologist who initially evaluated the MRI. Sensitivity, specificity, 
      positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated. RESULTS: 
      The sample consisted of 27 women (65.9%) and 14 men (34.1%). The sensitivity and 
      negative predictive value of MRI in PTNP were 0.18 and 0.77, respectively. Artifacts 
      interfered with visualization of a possible cause of the trigeminal pain in 24.4% of 
      MRIs. Almost all artifacts (90%) were caused by metal debris originating from the 
      causal procedure or posttraumatic surgeries. MRI resulted in changed management for 
      PTNP patients only once. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic value of non-nerve-selective MRI 
      sequences for PTNP is low and has little impact on clinical management. Therefore, 
      there is a need for dedicated sequences with high resolution and low artifact 
      susceptibility for visualizing the posttraumatic injuries of the trigeminal 
      branches.

LID - S0720-048X(13)00208-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejrad.2013.04.012 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the significance of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and 
      whole body MRI (WB-MRI) in the diagnosis, prognosis and assessment of therapy for 
      patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple 
      myeloma (MM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study includes 219 patients 
      providing 463 WB-MRI and DCE-MRI investigations for the subgroups MGUS (n=70), MM 
      active disease (n=126; this includes 70 patients with new diagnosis of MM, according 
      to the International Staging System (ISS): 41.4% ISS stage I, 20.0% ISS stage II, 
      7.1% ISS stage III, 31.4% insufficient for staging; and 56 patients with 
      '(re-)active disease': 16.07% relapse, 32.14% progressive disease and 51.79% stable 
      disease) and MM remission (n=23; 60.87% complete remission, 17.39% very good partial 
      remission and 21.74% partial remission). Investigations of patients with hereditary 
      multiple exostoses (n=5), neurofibromatosis (n=7) and healthy persons (n=9) were 
      added as control subjects (n=21). WB-MRI evaluation was done by evaluating thirteen 
      skeletal regions, providing a 'skeletal score'. DCE-MRI images of the spine, were 
      analyzed with regions-of-interest and time-intensity-curves (TIC). RESULTS: All TIC 
      parameters can significantly differentiate between the predefined subgroups 
      (p<0.001). One hundred days after autologous stem cell transplantation a 75% 
      decrease of the slope wash-in value (p<0.001) can be seen. A cubic regression trend 
      between 'skeletal score' and slope wash-in (adj.R(2)=0.412) could demonstrate a 
      significant increase bone marrow perfusion if MM affects more than 10 skeletal 
      regions (p<0.001), associated with a poorer prognosis (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: DCE-MRI 
      evaluation of the spine is useful for diagnosis of MM, follow-up after stem cell 
      transplantation and evaluation of disease activity. A combined evaluation with 
      WB-MRI and DCE-MRI provides additional micro-vascular information on the morphologic 
      lesions and could help categorize patients with MM in two different groups to offer 
      useful therapeutic and prognostic advise.

AB  - In MR images, the median nerve of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients frequently 
      appears flatter than in healthy subjects. The purpose of this work was to develop a 
      metric to quantify localized median nerve deformation rather than global nerve 
      flattening, the hypothesis being that localized median nerve deformation would be 
      elevated in CTS patients. Twelve patients with CTS and 12 matched normals underwent 
      MRI scanning in eight isometrically loaded hand conditions. 2D cross sections of the 
      proximal and distal tunnel were analyzed for nerve cross sectional area, flattening 
      ratio, and a position shift to the dorsal side of the tunnel. Additionally, new 
      metrics based on the angulation of the nerve perimeter in 0.5-mm lengths around the 
      boundary were calculated. The localized deformation metrics were able to detect 
      differences between CTS patients and healthy subjects that could not be appreciated 
      from the flattening ratio. During most hand activities, normal subjects had a higher 
      average percentage of locally deformed nerve boundary than did CTS patients, despite 
      having a rounder overall shape. Less local nerve deformation in the CTS patient 
      group resulting from its interaction with flexor tendons suggests that the nerve may 
      be less compliant in CTS patients.

TI  - Flexor carpi radialis brevis muscle: A case report and its prevalence in patients 
      with carpal tunnel syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the surgery for a distal radius fracture, we encountered a large 
      anomalous muscle lying across the distal radius. The muscle was identified as a 
      flexor carpi radialis brevis muscle (FCRB), based on its location, function, and 
      innervation. This experience led us to clarify its prevalence in living subjects and 
      alert surgeons of its presence. METHODS: We reviewed wrist MRI scans of 515 hands of 
      379 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The prevalence of the FCRB was 
      calculated. The cross sectional area (CSA) of the FCRB was compared with that of the 
      hypothenar muscles. Signal intensity and fat infiltration of the FCRB were assessed 
      using semiquantitative methods. The anterior compartment ratio (CSA of the anterior 
      compartment of the forearm was divided by CSA of the forearm. CSA of the FCRB was 
      excluded for measurement) was compared between patients with and without FCRB. 
      RESULTS: We found seven hands of six patients (1.6%) with a FCRB. All of these 
      tendons were inserted into the second metacarpal base. CSA of FCRB was smaller than 
      that of the hypothenar muscles. Semiquantitative assessment revealed normal signal 
      intensities of the FCRB compared with those of other muscles. The anterior 
      compartment ratio was smaller in patients with FCRB than without FCRB. None of the 
      FCRB in our series demonstrated any sign of tendinitis on MRI. Furthermore, the 
      postoperative clinical course for those patients was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Prevalence of FCRB in patients with CTS was 1.6%. FCRB should function as a wrist 
      flexor. Its strength varied according to the individuals but was not greater than 
      that of the hypothenar muscles. It is still unclear if the FCRB could cause the 
      development of CTS. However, it was found that the FCRB could be a mass which 
      occupies and narrows the anterior compartment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using three-dimensional (3D) printing to create individualized patient 
      models of the skull base, the optic chiasm and facial nerve can be previsualized to 
      help identify and protect these structures during tumor removal surgery. METHODS: 
      Preoperative imaging data for 2 cases of sellar tumor and 1 case of acoustic neuroma 
      were obtained. Based on these data, the cranial nerves were visualized using 3D 
      T1-weighted turbo field echo sequence and diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber 
      tracking. Mimics software was used to create 3D reconstructions of the skull base 
      regions surrounding the tumors, and 3D solid models were printed for use in 
      simulation of the basic surgical steps. RESULTS: The 3D printed personalized skull 
      base tumor solid models contained information regarding the skull, brain tissue, 
      blood vessels, cranial nerves, tumors, and other associated structures. The sphenoid 
      sinus anatomy, saddle area, and cerebellopontine angle region could be visually 
      displayed, and the spatial relationship between the tumor and the cranial nerves and 
      important blood vessels was clearly defined. The models allowed for simulation of 
      the operation, prediction of operative details, and verification of accuracy of 
      cranial nerve reconstruction during the operation. Questionnaire assessment showed 
      that neurosurgeons highly valued the accuracy and usefulness of these skull base 
      tumor models. CONCLUSIONS: 3D printed models of skull base tumors and nearby cranial 
      nerves, by allowing for the surgical procedure to be simulated beforehand, 
      facilitate preoperative planning and help prevent cranial nerve injury.

AB  - PURPOSE: To define the optimal acquisition parameters for diffusion tensor imaging 
      of the median nerve at the wrist and to measure the diffusion values. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: The wrists of 14 healthy volunteers were explored using 3T MRI with a 
      dedicated wrist coil. Each examination consisted of six sequences, varying the 
      number of directions (15-20-30) and the b values (500-800-1000-2000s/mm(2)). The 
      tractography images were evaluated by two radiologists using a qualitative scale 
      with six levels. The diffusion and anisotropy coefficients (ADC and FA) were 
      measured and the values compared with the data in the literature. RESULTS: Median 
      nerve tractography was successfully achieved in all sequences. The 20 direction 
      sequence with b=1000s/mm(2) seemed to provide the best results for a reasonable 
      acquisition time (5'38″). The diffusion values showed large interindividual 
      variations. CONCLUSION: Optimisation of acquisitions parameters is important in 
      peripheral nerve tractography, and may facilitate a routine use of the technique. 
      The images obtained are easy to analyse but the diffusivity and anisotropy 
      coefficients are too variable, however, to be used in practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate different brain regions for grey (GM) and white matter 
      (WM) damage in a well-defined cohort of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder 
      (NMOSD) patients and compare advanced MRI techniques (VBM, Subcortical and cortical

      METHODS: We analyzed 21 NMOSD patients and 21 age and gender matched control 
      subjects. VBM (GW/WM) and DTI whole brain (TBSS) analyses were performed at 
      different statistical thresholds to reflect different statistical approaches in 
      previous studies. In an automated atlas-based approach, Freesurfer and DTI results 
      were compared between NMOSD and controls. RESULTS: DTI TBSS and DTI atlas based 
      analysis demonstrated microstructural impairment only within the optic radiation or 
      in regions associated with the optic radiation (posterior thalamic radiation 
      p < 0.001, 6.9 % reduction of fractional anisotropy). VBM demonstrated widespread 
      brain GM and WM reduction, but only at exploratory statistical thresholds, with no 
      differences remaining after correction for multiple comparisons. Freesurfer analysis 
      demonstrated no group differences. CONCLUSION: NMOSD specific parenchymal brain 
      damage is predominantly located in the optic radiation, likely due to a secondary 
      degeneration caused by ON. In comparison, DTI appears to be the most reliable and 
      sensitive technique for brain damage detection in NMOSD. KEY POINTS: • The 
      hypothesis of a widespread brain damage in NMOSD is challenged. • The optic 
      radiation (OR) is the most severely affected region. • OR-affection is likely due to 
      secondary degeneration following optic neuritis. • DTI is currently the most 
      sensitive technique for NMOSD-related brain-damage detection. • DTI is currently the 
      most reliable technique for NMOSD-related brain-damage detection.

TI  - Diagnosis of Conversion Disorder Using Diffusion Tensor Tractography and 
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in a Patient with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.

AB  - We report on a patient with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) who was diagnosed with 
      conversion disorder for severe weakness of an arm, which was demonstrated using 
      diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A 
      23-year-old right-handed female suffered from head trauma resulting from a 
      pedestrian car accident. She underwent rehabilitative management for memory 
      impairment and central pain. At 14 months after onset, she complained of severe 
      weakness of her right arm, which was detected in the morning after sleeping (right 
      shoulder abductor: 3/5, elbow flexor: 3/5, wrist extensor: 1/5, finger flexor: 1/5, 
      and finger extensor: 1/5). Electromyography study for peripheral neuropathy 
      performed at 2 weeks after onset of weakness showed no abnormality. On a 14-month 
      DTT configuration, the integrities of the left corticospinal tract (CST), 
      supplementary motor area-corticofugal tract (SMA-CFT), and dorsal premotor cortex 
      (dPMC)-CFT were well-preserved. Significant differences were not observed for the 
      fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and tract volume (TV) values of 
      the CST, SMA-CFT, and dPMC-CFT in both hemispheres between the patient and ten 
      right-handed age- and sex-matched normal subjects (p > 0.05). On a 14-month TMS 
      study, MEPs obtained at the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle showed no 
      abnormality. Using DTT and TMS, conversion disorder was demonstrated in a patient 
      with mild TBI, who showed severe weakness of an arm. Our results suggest the 
      usefulness of an evaluation of the CST and CFTs from the secondary motor areas using 
      DTT, and the CST using TMS for patients who complain of motor weakness due to 
      conversion disorder.

PG  - 1009-12
LID - 10.1007/s00247-008-0899-5 [doi]
AB  - Perineuroma, rare in children, presents as a painless mononeuropathy of a major 
      nerve trunk. Resection of the lesion with end-to-end sural nerve grafting appears to 
      be the treatment of choice. This technique is not recommended if the unhealthy 
      segment of nerve is too long or if spinal roots are involved. However, in children, 
      reports of direct MR evaluation of nerve trunks and of the exiting nerve roots are 
      limited. We report a 7-year-old girl with an intramural sciatic nerve perineuroma in 
      whom the diagnosis was made by MRI and confirmed by biopsy. The MR protocol 
      combining 3-D T2-W STIR SPACE, fat-saturated gadolinium-enhanced T1-W images, and 
      diffusion tensor imaging with tractography was a valuable tool for depicting 
      peripheral nerve and roots in order to plan surgical treatment.

TI  - Dynamic effects on the lumbar spinal canal: axially loaded CT-myelography and MRI in 
      patients with sciatica and/or neurogenic claudication.
PG  - 2968-76
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: In patients with sciatica or neurogenic claudication, the structures 
      in and adjacent to the lumbar spinal canal were observed by computed tomographic 
      myelography or magnetic resonance imaging in psoas-relaxed position and during axial 
      compression in slight extension of the lumbar spine. OBJECTIVES: To determine the 
      mechanical effects on the lumbar spinal canal in a simulated upright position. 
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: For years, functional myelographic investigation 
      techniques were shown to be of value in the evaluation of suspected encroachment of 
      the spinal canal. Since the advent of computed tomography and magnetic resonance 
      imaging, there have been few clinical and experimental attempts that have imitated 
      these techniques. The data indicate that the space within the canal is posture 
      dependent. METHODS: Portable devices for axial loading of the lumbar spine in 
      computed tomographic and magnetic resonance examinations were developed. Fifty 
      patients (94 sites) were studied with computed tomographic myelography, and 34 
      patients (80 sites) with magnetic resonance in psoas-relaxed position followed by 
      axial compression in slight extension. The dural sac cross-sectional area at L2 to 
      S1, the deformation of the dural sac and the nerve roots, and the changes of the 
      tissues surrounding the canal were observed. RESULTS: In 66 of the investigated 84 
      patients, there was a statistically significant reduction of the dural sac 
      cross-sectional area in at least one site during axial compression in slight 
      extension. Of the investigated patients, 29 passed the borderlines for relative (100 
      mm2) or absolute stenosis (75 mm2) in 40 sites. In 30 patients, there was 
      deformation of the dural sac in 46 sites. In 11 of the patients investigated with 
      magnetic resonance imaging, there was a narrowing of the lateral recess in 13 sites, 
      during axial compression in slight extension. CONCLUSIONS: Axial loading of the 
      lumbar spine in computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging is 
      recommended in patients with sciatica or neurogenic claudication when the dural sac 
      cross-sectional area at any disc location is below 130 mm2 in conventional 
      psoas-relaxed position and when there is a suspected narrowing of the dural sac or 
      the nerve roots, especially in the ventrolateral part of the spinal canal in 
      psoas-relaxed position. The diagnostic specificity of the spinal stenosis will 
      increase considerably when the patient is subjected to an axial load.

TI  - Nanofibrous nerve guidance conduits decorated with decellularized matrix hydrogel 
      facilitate peripheral nerve injury repair.
PG  - 2917-2931
LID - 10.7150/thno.50825 [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a great challenge for regenerative 
      medicine. Nerve autograft is the gold standard for clinical PNI repair. Due to its 
      significant drawbacks, artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) have drawn much 
      attention as replacement therapies. We developed a combinatorial NGC consisting of 
      longitudinally aligned electrospun nanofibers and porcine decellularized nerve 
      matrix hydrogel (pDNM gel). The in vivo capacity for facilitating nerve tissue 
      regeneration and functional recovery was evaluated in a rat sciatic nerve defect 
      model. Methods: Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) was electrospun into randomly oriented 
      (PLLA-random) and longitudinally aligned (PLLA-aligned) nanofibers. PLLA-aligned 
      were further coated with pDNM gel at concentrations of 0.25% (PLLA-aligned/0.25% 
      pDNM gel) and 1% (PLLA-aligned/1% pDNM gel). Axonal extension and Schwann cells 
      migration were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining of dorsal root ganglia 
      cultured on the scaffolds. To fabricate implantable NGCs, the nanofibrous scaffolds 
      were rolled and covered with an electrospun protection tube. The fabricated NGCs 
      were then implanted into a 5 mm sciatic nerve defect model in adult male 
      Sprague-Dawley rats. Nerves treated with NGCs were compared to contralateral 
      uninjured nerves (control group), injured but untreated nerves (unstitched group), 
      and autografted nerves. Nerve regeneration was monitored by an established set of 
      assays, including T2 values and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived from 
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histological assessments, and 
      immunostaining. Nerve functional recovery was evaluated by walking track analysis. 
      Results: PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel scaffold exhibited the best performance in 
      facilitating directed axonal extension and Schwann cells migration in vitro due to 
      the combined effects of the topological cues provided by the aligned nanofibers and 
      the biochemical cues retained in the pDNM gel. Consistent results were obtained in 
      animal experiments with the fabricated NGCs. Both the T2 and fractional anisotropy 
      values of the PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel group were the closest to those of the 
      autografted group, and returned to normal much faster than those of the other NGCs 
      groups. Histological assessment indicated that the implanted PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM 
      gel NGC resulted in the largest number of axons and the most extensive myelination 
      among all fabricated NGCs. Further, the PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel group exhibited 
      the highest sciatic nerve function index, which was comparable to that of the 
      autografted group, at 8 weeks post-surgery. Conclusions: NGCs composed of aligned 
      PLLA nanofibers decorated with 0.25% pDNM gel provided both topological and 
      biochemical guidance for directing and promoting axonal extension, nerve fiber 
      myelination, and functional recovery. Moreover, T2-mapping and DTI metrics were 
      found to be useful non-invasive monitoring techniques for PNI treatment.

AB  - Imaging of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has demonstrated key diffusion tensor 
      imaging-based diffusivity alterations in the trigeminal nerve; however, imaging has 
      primarily focused on the peripheral nerve segment because of previous limitations in 
      reliably segmenting small fiber bundles across multiple subjects. We used Selective 
      Automated Group Integrated Tractography to study 36 subjects with TN (right-sided 
      pain) and 36 sex-matched controls to examine the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial 
      nerve [CN V]), pontine decussation (TPT), and thalamocortical fibers (S1). Gaussian 
      process classifiers were trained by scrolling a moving window over CN V, TPT, and S1 
      tractography centroids. Fractional anisotropy (FA), generalized FA, radial 
      diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity metrics were evaluated for both 
      groups, analyzing TN vs control groups and affected vs unaffected sides. Classifiers 
      that performed at greater-than-or-equal-to 70% accuracy were included. Gaussian 
      process classifier consistently demonstrated bilateral trigeminal changes, 
      differentiating them from controls with an accuracy of 80%. Affected and unaffected 
      sides could be differentiated from each other with 75% accuracy. Bilateral TPT could 
      be distinguished from controls with at least 85% accuracy. TPT left-right 
      classification achieved 98% accuracy. Bilateral S1 could be differentiated from 
      controls, where the affected S1 radial diffusivity classifier achieved 87% accuracy. 
      This is the first TN study that combines group-wise merged tractography, machine 
      learning classification, and analysis of the complete trigeminal pathways from the 
      peripheral fibers to S1 cortex. This analysis demonstrates that TN is characterized 
      by bilateral abnormalities throughout the trigeminal pathway compared with controls 
      and abnormalities between affected and unaffected sides. This full pathway 
      tractography study of TN demonstrates bilateral changes throughout the trigeminal 
      pathway and changes between affected and unaffected sides.

TI  - The clinical significance of redundant nerve roots of the cauda equina in lumbar 
      spinal stenosis patients: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Decompression surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the most 
      performed spine surgery procedure in patients older than 65 years. Around 40% of LSS 
      patients scheduled for decompression surgery have evidence of redundant nerve roots 
      (RNR) of the cauda equina on their magnetic resonance images (MRI). Little is known 
      about the clinical significance of RNR in LSS patients. The objective was to assess 
      the effects of RNR on clinical scores and recovery in older adults diagnosed with 
      LSS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in April 
      2018 on PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
      Health Literature (CINAHL). Prospective and retrospective cohort studies undertaken 
      to assess differences in clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with LSS with 
      versus without evidence of RNR on their MRIs were selected. Two authors 
      independently selected studies, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. We 
      calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous variables and odds ratio 
      (OR) for variables reported in frequencies. RESULTS: Seven studies comprising a 
      total of 1046 LSS patients were included in the meta-analysis. LSS patients with 
      evidence of RNR (RNR+) were older, WMD 5.7 95% CI [2.2-9.2], p = 0.001, had smaller 
      cross sectional area (CSA) of the stenotic level, WMD -12.2 95% CI [-17.7 to -6.7], 
      p < 0.0001 and longer symptom onset duration, WMD 13.2 95% CI [-0.2-26.7], p = 0.05. 
      The pooled preoperative clinical score in the RNR + group was worse but the 
      difference was not statistically significant, WMD -3.8 95% CI [-7.9 to 0.2], 
      p = 0.07. After decompression surgery RNR + patients had worse clinical scores, -4.7 
      95% CI [-7.3 to -2.1], p = 0.0004 and lower recovery rates, -9.8 95% CI [-14.8 to 
      -4.7], p = 0.0001. CONCLUSION: There is limited quality evidence that RNR + patients 
      are older, have a longer symptom history and present higher degrees of lumbar 
      stenosis as given by the narrow CSA in comparison to RNR- patients. After 
      decompression surgery RNR + patients have worse clinical scores and lower recovery 
      rates. In view of these results RNR can be seen as a negative prognostic factor in 
      LSS patients.

TI  - In vivo visualization of the facial nerve in patients with acoustic neuroma using 
      diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking.
PG  - 787-794
AB  - OBJECTIVE Preoperative determination of the facial nerve (FN) course is essential to 
      preserving its function. Neither regular preoperative imaging examination nor 
      intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring is able to determine the exact 
      position of the FN. The diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking (DTI-FT) 
      technique has been widely used for the preoperative noninvasive visualization of the 
      neural fasciculus in the white matter of brain. However, further studies are 
      required to establish its role in the preoperative visualization of the FN in 
      acoustic neuroma surgery. The object of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of 
      using DTI-FT to visualize the FN. METHODS Data from 15 patients with acoustic 
      neuromas were collected using 3-T MRI. The visualized FN course and its position 
      relative to the tumors were determined using DTI-FT with 3D Slicer software. The 
      preoperative visualization results of FN tracking were verified using microscopic 
      observation and electrophysiological monitoring during microsurgery. RESULTS 
      Preoperative visualization of the FN using DTI-FT was observed in 93.3% of the 
      patients. However, in 92.9% of the patients, the FN visualization results were 
      consistent with the actual surgery. CONCLUSIONS DTI-FT, in combination with 
      intraoperative FN electrophysiological monitoring, demonstrated improved FN 
      preservation in patients with acoustic neuroma. FN visualization mainly included the 
      facial-vestibular nerve complex of the FN and vestibular nerve.

TI  - Visual evoked potentials study in chronic idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating 
      polyneuropathy.
PG  - 2285-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of the association between chronic demyelinating 
      inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) and central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating 
      lesions is probably underestimated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of 
      combined central and peripheral demyelination in CIDP patients and to correlate 
      visual evoked potential (VEP) abnormalities with CNS demyelinating lesions, observed 
      on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and antibodies against glycolipids. METHODS: 
      Nerve conduction studies, brain MRI and antibodies against glycolipids were 
      prospectively studied in 17 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria proposed 
      for CIDP (Cornblath DR, Asbury AK, Albers JW, Feasby TE, Hahn AF, McLeod JG, Mendell 
      JR, Parry GJ, Pollard JD, Thomas PK. Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of 
      Neurology AIDS Task Force. Research criteria for diagnosis of chronic inflammatory 
      demyelinating polyneuropathy. Neurology, 1991;41:617-618). VEPs were performed in 
      each case before and after 6 months treatment with either intravenous 
      immunoglobulins (IVIG) or steroids. RESULTS: Eight patients (47%) had increased 
      latencies in at least one eye or showed increased interocular latency difference. 
      Four patients (23%) presented a significant high signal intensity on T2-weighted 
      brain MRI images. Of these 4 patients, 3 had prolonged VEP latency. Two patients 
      with delayed VEP latency had antibodies against GM1, and SGLPG and anti-sulfatides, 
      respectively. One patient with normal VEPs also had antibodies to GM1. VEP results 
      were not significantly modified after treatment, either with steroids or IVIG. 
      CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the high frequency of abnormal VEPs in CIDP 
      patients, and found that they are poorly correlated with CNS demyelinating lesions 
      and antibodies against glycolipids. The VEP abnormalities of these patients may be 
      explained by the susceptibility to immune-mediated damage of both the peripheral 
      nervous system and the optic nerve.

AB  - OBJECT Visual field defects (VFDs) due to optic radiation (OR) injury are a common 
      complication of temporal lobe surgery. The authors analyzed whether preoperative 
      visualization of the optic tract would reduce this complication by influencing the 
      surgeon's decisions about surgical approaches. The authors also determined whether 
      white matter shifts caused by temporal lobe tumors would follow predetermined 
      patterns based on the tumor's topography. METHODS One hundred thirteen patients with 
      intraaxial tumors of the temporal lobe underwent preoperative diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) fiber tracking. In 54 of those patients, both pre- and postoperative 
      VFDs were documented using computerized perimetry. Brainlab's iPlan 2.5 navigation 
      software was used for tumor reconstruction and fiber visualization after the fusion 
      of DTI studies with their respective magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo 
      (MP-RAGE) images. The tracking algorithm was as follows: minimum fiber length 100 
      mm, fractional anisotropy threshold 0.1. The lateral geniculate body and the 
      calcarine cortex were employed as tract seeding points. Shifts of the OR caused by 
      tumor were visualized in comparison with the fiber tracking of the patient's healthy 
      hemisphere. RESULTS Temporal tumors produced a dislocation of the OR but no apparent 
      fiber destruction. The shift of white matter tracts followed fixed patterns 
      dependent on tumor location: Temporolateral tumors resulted in a medial fiber shift, 
      and thus a lateral transcortical approach is recommended. Temporopolar tumors led to 
      a posterior shift, always including Meyer's loop; therefore, a pterional 
      transcortical approach is recommended. Temporomesial tumors produced a lateral and 
      superior shift; thus, a transsylvian-transcisternal approach will result in maximum 
      sparing of the fibers. Temporocentric tumors also induced a lateral fiber shift. For 
      those tumors, a transsylvian-transopercular approach is recommended. Tumors of the 
      fusiform gyrus generated a superior (and lateral) shift; consequently, a subtemporal 
      approach is recommended to avoid white matter injury. In applying the approaches 
      recommended above, new or worsened VFDs occurred in 4% of the patient cohort. Total 
      neurological and surgical morbidity were less than 10%. In 90% of patients, 
      gross-total resection was accomplished. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative visualization of 
      the OR may help in avoiding postoperative VFDs.

TI  - Anatomic and metabolic evaluation of peripheral nerve sheath tumors in patients with 
      neurofibromatosis 1 using whole-body MRI and (18)F-FDG PET fusion.
PG  - e301-7
LID - 10.1097/RLU.0b013e3182a757d3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the leading cause of 
      death for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Identification of 
      hypermetabolic lesions on PET may help identify patients at risk for MPNST. The 
      objective of this study was to identify clinical and MRI-derived variables that 
      predicted increased metabolic activity of neurofibromas in NF1 patients as 
      determined by PET. METHODS: This prospective study included NF1 patients with 
      neurofibromas of 5 cm in diameter or greater. All patients underwent whole-body MRI 
      and F-FDG PET imaging. Tumor volume was calculated from the MR scans using a 
      semiautomated 3-dimensional segmentation method. SUVmax's were calculated to 
      quantify metabolic activity. Logistic regression analyses were performed to 
      determine the relationship among SUVmax, tumor volume, location (extremity vs 
      trunk), type (plexiform vs circumscribed), depth (superficial vs deep), patient age, 
      and whole-body tumor burden. RESULTS: A total of 311 neurofibromas were identified 
      in 19 NF1 patients (mean age, 38 years; range, 19-58 years). One extreme outlier was 
      excluded from analysis. Whole-body tumor volumes ranged from 0.4 to 1182.4 mL. Fifty 
      of 310 tumors were FDG-avid on PET (16%) with median SUVmax of 2.2 (range, 0.4-9.6). 
      Metabolic activity (SUVmax >2.5) correlated with tumor location (deep > superficial, 
      trunk > extremity) in tumors with PET avidity. CONCLUSIONS: In NF1 patients with 
      neurofibromas of 5 cm or greater, the majority of internal tumors are not 
      metabolically active on PET. Tumors with increased metabolic activity as defined by 
      SUVmax greater than 2.5 (ie, suggestive of MPNST) are more likely to be deep and 
      located within the trunk.

TI  - Microstructural Changes in Compressed Nerve Roots Are Consistent With Clinical 
      Symptoms and Symptom Duration in Patients With Lumbar Disc Herniation.
PG  - E661-E666
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000001354 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between 
      microstructural nerve roots changes on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and clinical 
      symptoms and their duration in patients with lumbar disc herniation. SUMMARY OF 
      BACKGROUND DATA: The ability to identify microstructural properties of the nervous 
      system with DTI has been demonstrated in many studies. However, there are no data 
      regarding the association between microstructural changes evaluated using DTI and 
      symptoms assessed with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and their duration. 
      METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with foraminal disc herniation affecting 
      unilateral sacral 1 (S1) nerve roots were enrolled in this study. DTI with 
      tractography was performed on the S1 nerve roots. Clinical symptoms were evaluated 
      using an ODI questionnaire for each patient, and the duration of clinical symptoms 
      was noted based on the earliest instance of leg pain and numbness. Mean fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated from 
      tractography images. RESULTS: The mean FA value of the compressed lumbar nerve roots 
      was significantly lower than the FA of the contralateral nerve roots (P < 0.001). No 
      notable difference in ADC was observed between compressed nerve roots and 
      contralateral nerve roots (P = 0.517). In the compressed nerve roots, a significant 
      negative association was observed between FA values and ODI and symptom duration. 
      However, an obvious positive association was observed between ODI and ADC values and 
      duration on the compressed side. CONCLUSION: Significant changes in diffusion 
      parameters were found in the compressed sacral nerves in patients with lumbar disc 
      herniation and leg pain, indicating that the microstructure of the nerve root has 
      been damaged. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

TI  - Asymmetric atrophy of multifidus muscle in patients with unilateral lumbosacral 
      radiculopathy.
PG  - E598-602
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case-control study of multifidus muscle atrophy in 39 
      patients with unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy and lumbosacral disc herniation 
      and 20 controls. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate quantitatively the asymmetry of multifidus 
      muscles in unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy with disc herniation (herniated 
      intervertebral disc; HIVD) by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). SUMMARY OF 
      BACKGROUND DATA: Histologic and morphologic changes of multifidus muscles have been 
      reported in lumbosacral disc herniation, but there are few imaging studies on the 
      changes of multifidus muscles in unilateral radiculopathy. METHODS: Bilateral 
      multifidus muscles in L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 levels were detected in fast spin-echo 
      T1 axial MRI images. The total cross-sectional area (CSA) of multifidus muscles 
      (TMA) and the density of pure muscle CSA (PMA) were measured by a computerized 
      analysis program, and the ratios of PMA to TMA (PMA/TMA) and the PMA ratios of 
      involved to uninvolved sides (IMA/UMA) were calculated. The patients were divided 
      into 2 groups according to the electrodiagnosis results: a radiculopathy (RAD) group 
      and an HIVD group without definite radiculopathy. RESULTS: Fourteen patients had 
      lumbosacral radiculopathies (RAD group) while 25 had no radiculopathy (HIVD group). 
      No significant difference was found between the RAD and HIVD groups in TMA, PMA, and 
      PMA/TMA. In terms of the criteria for the upper limit of IMA/UMA, 78.6% in the RAD 
      group had an abnormal IMA/UMA ratio in at least 1 level, compared with 24% in the 
      HIVD group and 10% in the control group. Thus, more cases with less muscle volume in 
      the involved side were seen in the RAD group than in the HIVD and control groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Asymmetry of the multifidus muscles as seen in MRI was a useful finding 
      to assess patients who had unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy with HIVD. This may 
      reflect the denervation of multifidus muscles in lumbosacral radiculopathy.

TI  - Ultra-fast steady state free precession and its application to in vivo (1)H 
      morphological and functional lung imaging at 1.5 tesla.
PG  - 657-63
LID - 10.1002/mrm.24858 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The speed limit for three-dimensional Fourier-encoded steady state free 
      precession (SSFP) imaging is explored on a clinical whole body system and pushed 
      toward a pulse repetition time (TR) close to or even below the 1 ms regime; in the 
      following referred to as ultra-fast SSFP imaging. METHODS: To this end, contemporary 
      optimization strategies, such as efficient gradient switching patterns, partial 
      echoes, ramp sampling techniques, and a target-related design of excitation pulses 
      were applied to explore the lower boundaries in TR for SSFP-based Cartesian imaging. 
      RESULTS: Generally, minimal TR was limited in vivo by peripheral nerve stimulation, 
      allowing a TR ∼1 ms for isotropic resolutions down to about 2 mm. As a result, 
      ultra-fast balanced SSFP provides artifact-free images even for targets with severe 
      susceptibility variations, and native high-resolution structural and functional in 
      vivo (1)H imaging of the human lung is demonstrated at 1.5 T. CONCLUSION: On 
      clinical whole body MRI systems, the TR of SSFP-based Cartesian imaging can be 
      pushed toward the 1 ms regime. As a result, ultra-fast SSFP protocols might 
      represent a promising new powerful approach for SSFP-based imaging, not only for 
      lung but also in a variety of clinical and scientific applications.

TI  - Altered brain morphometry in carpal tunnel syndrome is associated with median nerve 
      pathology.
PG  - 313-319
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common median nerve entrapment 
      neuropathy characterized by pain, paresthesias, diminished peripheral nerve 
      conduction velocity (NCV) and maladaptive functional brain neuroplasticity. We 
      evaluated structural reorganization in brain gray (GM) and white (WM) matter and 
      whether such plasticity is linked to altered median nerve function in CTS. METHODS: 
      We performed NCV testing, T1-weighted structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging 
      (DTI) in 28 CTS and 28 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Voxel-based morphometry 
      (VBM) contrasted regional GM volume for CTS versus HC. Significant clusters were 
      correlated with clinical metrics and served as seeds to define associated WM tracts 
      using DTI data and probabilistic tractography. Within these WM tracts, fractional 
      anisotropy (FA), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity were evaluated for group 
      differences and correlations with clinical metrics. RESULTS: For CTS subjects, GM 
      volume was significantly reduced in contralesional S1 (hand-area), pulvinar and 
      frontal pole. GM volume in contralesional S1 correlated with median NCV. NCV was 
      also correlated with RD and was negatively correlated with FA within U-fiber 
      cortico-cortical association tracts identified from the contralesional S1 VBM seed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified clear morphometric changes in the CTS brain. This 
      central morphometric change is likely secondary to peripheral nerve pathology and 
      altered somatosensory afference. Enhanced axonal coherence and myelination within 
      cortico-cortical tracts connecting primary somatosensory and motor areas may 
      accompany peripheral nerve deafferentation. As structural plasticity was correlated 
      with NCV and not symptomatology, the former may be a better determinant of 
      appropriate clinical intervention for CTS, including surgery.

TI  - Effect of age on the fractional anisotropy (FA) value of peripheral nerves and 
      clinical significance of the age-corrected FA value for evaluating polyneuropathies.
PG  - 815-21
LID - 10.1007/s00234-011-0981-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the correlation between age and the fractional 
      anisotropy (FA) values of peripheral nerves in healthy adults and compared the 
      age-corrected FA values of peripheral nerves in healthy subjects and patients with 
      polyneuropathy. METHODS: The institutional review board approved this study and 
      informed consent was obtained from all participants before entry into the study. We 
      optimized diffusion tensor imaging using a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner and an 
      extremity coil for scanning tibial nerves. The effect of age and sex on the FA 
      values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers was investigated and the age-corrected 
      FA values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers and patients with polyneuropathy 
      were compared. RESULTS: The maximum FA values of the tibial nerves remained constant 
      until age 45 (approximately 0.516); they subsequently decreased by 0.004/year in 
      healthy volunteers. After removing the effect of age with an age-adjusted equation, 
      the median maximum FA values in the volunteers and patients were 0.518 (range, 
      0.406-0.616) and 0.442 (range, 0.376-0.530), respectively. The age-corrected FA 
      values were significantly lower in the patients than the healthy volunteers 
      (p < 0.001). There was no significant gender-related difference in the maximum FA 
      values of the tibial nerves (p = 0.416). CONCLUSION: The age-corrected FA value of 
      the peripheral nerves helps to differentiate between age-related peripheral nerve 
      degeneration and polyneuropathies.

TI  - Atrophy of foot muscles in diabetic patients can be detected with ultrasonography.
PG  - 3053-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a bedside test with ultrasonography for evaluation of foot 
      muscle atrophy in diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thickness and 
      cross-sectional area (CSA) of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle (EDB) and of the 
      muscles of the first interstitium (MILs) were determined in 26 diabetic patients and 
      in 26 matched control subjects using ultrasonography. To estimate the validity, 
      findings were related to the total volume of all foot muscles determined at magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI-FM(vol)). Furthermore, the relations of ultrasonographic 
      estimates to nerve conduction, sensory perception thresholds, and clinical condition 
      were established. RESULTS: In diabetic patients, the ultrasonographic thickness of 
      EDB (U-EDB(t)) was (means +/- SD) 6.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 9.0 +/- 1.0 mm in control subjects 
      (P < 0.001), the thickness of MIL (U-MIL(t)) was 29.6 +/- 8.3 vs. 40.2 +/- 3.6 mm in 
      control subjects (P < 0.001), and the CSA of EDB (U-EDB(CSA)) was 116 +/- 65 vs. 214 
      +/- 38 mm(2) in control subjects (P < 0.001). The MRI-FM(vol) was directly related 
      to U-EDB(t) (r = 0.77), U-MIL(t) (r = 0.71), and U-EDB(CSA) (r = 0.74). U-EDB(t) and 
      U-MIL(t) were thinner in neuropathic than in nonneuropathic diabetic patients (5.8 
      +/- 2.1 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.7 mm [P < 0.05] and 28.3 +/- 8.8 vs. 35.6 +/- 4.3 mm [P < 
      0.03], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Atrophy of intrinsic foot muscles determined at 
      ultrasonography is directly related to foot muscle volume determined by MRI and to 
      various measures of diabetic neuropathy. Ultrasonography seems to be useful for 
      detection of foot muscle atrophy in diabetes.

AB  - Augmented reality could help the identification of nerve structures in brachial 
      plexus surgery. The goal of this study was to determine which law of mechanical 
      behavior was more adapted by comparing the results of Hooke's isotropic linear 
      elastic law to those of Ogden's isotropic hyperelastic law, applied to a 
      biomechanical model of the brachial plexus. A model of finite elements was created 
      using the ABAQUS(®) from a 3D model of the brachial plexus acquired by segmentation 
      and meshing of MRI images at 0°, 45° and 135° of shoulder abduction of a healthy 
      subject. The offset between the reconstructed model and the deformed model was 
      evaluated quantitatively by the Hausdorff distance and qualitatively by the 
      identification of 3 anatomical landmarks. In every case the Hausdorff distance was 
      shorter with Ogden's law compared to Hooke's law. On a qualitative aspect, the model 
      deformed by Ogden's law followed the concavity of the reconstructed model whereas 
      the model deformed by Hooke's law remained convex. In conclusion, the results of 
      this study demonstrate that the behavior of Ogden's isotropic hyperelastic 
      mechanical model was more adapted to the modeling of the deformations of the 
      brachial plexus.

TI  - A new 3-dimensional computed tomography imaging method to diagnose extraforaminal 
      stenosis at the lumbosacral junction.
PG  - e47-52
LID - 10.1097/BSD.0b013e3181cdd262 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study using a newly developed imaging diagnosis method 
      to examine the patients with L5 radiculopathy. OBJECTIVE: To confirm the efficacy of 
      a new 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) imaging method to diagnose 
      extraforaminal stenosis at the lumbosacral junction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The 
      lack of recognition of extraforaminal stenosis at the lumbosacral junction is a 
      cause of failed back surgery syndrome. A clear method to diagnose this condition is 
      essential. METHODS: The participants were 75 consecutive patients (mean age 69.5 y) 
      with or without cauda equina symptoms who were treated by microendoscopic spinal 
      surgery for L5 radiculopathy. The lesion responsible for the symptoms was identified 
      by a combination of neurologic findings, selective radiculography, (3D MRI), and 
      intraoperative neurophysiological findings. Multislice CT scanning was carried out 
      preoperatively from the L1 vertebral body to the sacrum in all patients. The CT scan 
      images were transferred to a remote computer workstation, and the reconstructed 
      images were examined after surgery by an investigator blinded to the clinical 
      diagnoses. In the reconstructed plane, we measured the minimum cross-sectional area 
      of the de novo bony tunnel formed by the L5 transverse process, sacral ala, and L5 
      vertebral body, that is, lumbosacral bony tunnel (LSBT) and determined a cutoff 
      value to diagnose extraforaminal stenosis. The shape of the LSBT was also evaluated 
      in relation to the diagnosis. RESULTS: In 3D CT analysis, the LSBT was found on the 
      ipsilateral side in 51 of the 75 patients. The bony tunnel was outside the foramen 
      in all patients diagnosed clinically with extraforaminal stenosis, but in only 60% 
      of the patients without extraforaminal stenosis. The minimum cross-sectional area of 
      the bony tunnel was significantly smaller in patients with an extraforaminal 
      stenosis than in those without extraforaminal stenosis. The cutoff value was set at 
      0.8 cm2. The cross-sectional area was <0.8 cm2 in all patients with extraforaminal 
      stenosis. The specificity of this diagnostic procedure was 89.6%, and the 
      sensitivity was 100%. All true-positive cases had the spur-type shape of the bony 
      tunnel, and all false-positive cases had the round-type shape. CONCLUSIONS: All 
      patients with extraforaminal stenosis had an LSBT. The minimum cross-sectional area 
      of the bony tunnel was significantly smaller in patients with an extraforaminal 
      lesion than in those without an extraforaminal lesion. 3D CT is a useful tool for 
      diagnosing extraforaminal stenosis at the lumbosacral junction.

TI  - MR of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
PG  - 593-7
AB  - Seventeen benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors were studied using MR. In all cases 
      T2 relaxation time, signal intensity on T1-weighted images (lesion/muscle ratio), 
      detectability of nerve of origin, nerve-lesion relationship, and presence of a 
      capsule were assessed. Sixteen tumors showed marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted 
      images with T2 relaxation times values greater than 95 ms. One schwannoma was almost 
      isointense with fat (T2 60 ms). All lesions were isointense with muscle on 
      T1-weighted images. In schwannomas the nerve was usually situated at the periphery 
      of the lesion and only in one case was it obliterated by the mass. In neurofibromas 
      the nerve was either visible in a central position within the mass (two cases) or no 
      longer visible (five cases). A capsule could be detected in 70% of the schwannomas 
      and in 30% of the neurofibromas. In patients with soft tissue masses, MR may 
      contribute to recognition of nerve sheath tumors by showing the nerve of origin and 
      typical signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. It can also be helpful in 
      distinguishing between schwannomas and neurofibromas by the location of the nerve of 
      origin and the presence of a capsule.

TI  - Brain imaging signature of neuropathic pain phenotypes in small-fiber neuropathy: 
      altered thalamic connectome and its associations with skin nerve degeneration.
PG  - 1387-1399
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002155 [doi]
AB  - Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) has been traditionally considered as a pure disorder of 
      the peripheral nervous system, characterized by neuropathic pain and degeneration of 
      small-diameter nerve fibers in the skin. Previous functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging studies revealed abnormal activations of pain networks, but the structural 
      basis underlying such maladaptive functional alterations remains elusive. We applied 
      diffusion tensor imaging to explore the influences of SFN on brain microstructures. 
      Forty-one patients with pathology-proven SFN with reduced skin innervation were 
      recruited. White matter connectivity with the thalamus as the seed was assessed 
      using probabilistic tractography of diffusion tensor imaging. Patients with SFN had 
      reduced thalamic connectivity with the insular cortex and the sensorimotor areas, 
      including the postcentral and precentral gyri. Furthermore, the degree of skin nerve 
      degeneration, measured by intraepidermal nerve fiber density, was associated with 
      the reduction of connectivity between the thalamus and pain-related areas according 
      to different neuropathic pain phenotypes, specifically, the frontal, cingulate, 
      motor, and limbic areas for burning, electrical shocks, tingling, mechanical 
      allodynia, and numbness. Despite altered white matter connectivity, there was no 
      change in white matter integrity assessed with fractional anisotropy. Our findings 
      indicate that alterations in structural connectivity may serve as a biomarker of 
      maladaptive brain plasticity that contributes to neuropathic pain after peripheral 
      nerve degeneration.

AB  - Ischemic stroke affects over 15 million patients per year and is a leading cause of 
      death worldwide. Currently available treatments are indicated for less than 5% of 
      patients. Stimulation of the facial nerve has been proposed as a possible new 
      treatment of ischemic stroke that acts by increasing blood flow to the brain and 
      thereby restoring perfusion through collateral vessels. The objective of this 
      project was to evaluate the changes in brain perfusion, following facial nerve 
      stimulation in an animal stroke model using MRI measures of cerebral blood flow. 
      Autologous blood clot was injected in the internal carotid artery to occlude the 
      middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 17 mongrel dogs. Occlusion in the MCA was verified 
      using fluoroscopy and MRI angiography. Following baseline and post-stroke MRI 
      images, the facial nerve at the site of the geniculate ganglion was located and then 
      stimulated using a transcranial magnetic stimulator and a neuro-navigation system in 
      11 animals. Six animals followed the same procedure but were not stimulated (control 
      group). The perfusion index of both sides of the brain was measured using gadolinium 
      contrast MRI before and after stroke, and at 30 minute intervals after stimulation. 
      Results show a significant and persistent increase in perfusion in the stroke side 
      of the brain relative to the non-stroke / contralateral side, after stimulation, 
      when compared to the control group. These results strongly support the future 
      development and evaluation of a non-invasive facial nerve stimulator device for the 
      early treatment of ischemic stroke.

AB  - In this study we described a case of lipofibromatous hamartoma involving the median 
      nerve. We adopted diffusion tensor imaging and constrained spherical 
      deconvolution-based tractography to reconstruct the affected median nerve. Moreover, 
      we extracted diffusion-based parameters reflecting axonal integrity loss of median 
      nerve fibres. Our data showed that constrained spherical deconvolution-based 
      tractography outperformed the diffusion tensor imaging-based method, allowing the 
      detection of the entire median nerve, including its branches, thus offering a robust 
      method to investigate the involvement of the median nerve in pathological 
      conditions. All clinical and technical implications are extensively described.

TI  - Voxel-based morphometry demonstrates reduced grey matter density on brain MRI in 
      patients with diabetic retinopathy.
PG  - 2474-80
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In addition to nephropathy, retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy, 
      a microvascular complication of type 1 diabetes that may be tentatively referred to 
      as 'diabetic encephalopathy' has gained increasing attention. There is growing 
      evidence that lowered cognitive performance in patients with type 1 diabetes is 
      related to chronic hyperglycaemia rather than recurrent episodes of severe 
      hypoglycaemia, as previously speculated. The aim of our study was to use magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) to establish whether long-term hyperglycaemia, resulting in 
      advanced retinopathy, contributes to structural changes in the brain (reduced grey 
      matter). SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied voxel-based morphometry on 
      magnetic resonance images to compare grey matter density (GMD) between three groups 
      of participants. GMD is used as a marker of cortical atrophy. We compared 13 type 1 
      diabetic patients with a microvascular complication (i.e. proliferative retinopathy) 
      with 18 type 1 diabetic patients who did not have retinopathy in order to assess the 
      effects of microvascular changes on GMD. Both patient groups were compared with 21 
      healthy control subjects to assess the effect of diabetes in itself. RESULTS: 
      Patients with diabetic retinopathy showed reduced GMD in the right inferior frontal 
      gyrus and right occipital lobe compared both with patients without retinopathy and 
      with healthy controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data show that 
      patients with type 1 diabetes, who, as a consequence of chronic hyperglycaemia, had 
      developed advanced retinopathy, also showed increased focal cortical atrophy on 
      brain MRI.

      examination of a giant median nerve.
PG  - 989-993
LID - 10.1007/s00256-018-3098-y [doi]
AB  - Macrodystrophia lipomatosa, a hamartomatous enlargement of soft tissues leading to 
      gigantism of a part or a whole extremity, generally affects the territory of 
      distribution of a single nerve. In some cases, this condition may cause an 
      entrapment neuropathy. We report the clinical, radiological, and surgical findings 
      of a patient with isolated non-syndromic macrodactyly and giant median nerve 
      presenting recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In this case, conventional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) supported the 
      presence of fibrohamartomatous infiltration, determining an enlargement of the 
      median nerve and consequently an increased susceptibility to compression damage. A 
      57-year-old man presenting macrodactyly of the second and third finger of the right 
      hand showed recent onset of severe hypoesthesia of the first three fingers of the 
      right hand. He also underwent surgery for right CTS 23 years before. The 
      electromyography/electroneurography confirmed the diagnosis of CTS. The 
      ultrasonography showed a massive enlargement of the median nerve within the carpal 
      tunnel, while MRI confirmed the enlargement of the median nerve with thickened 
      hypointense bundles and interposed tissue, with increased mean diffusivity and 
      decreased fractional anisotropy at DTI. We discuss about the use of a relatively 
      novel imaging technique, investigating for the first time an uncommon cause of a 
      very common entrapment neuropathy.

LID - 10.1002/mus.27205 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the changes in MRI T2 mapping values in subjects with 
      carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) compared to healthy controls. METHODS: We enrolled 71 
      patients with CTS and 26 healthy controls. Median nerve T2 values were measured at 
      the distal carpal tunnel, hamate bone, proximal carpal tunnel, and forearm levels. 
      These were compared between patients and controls and correlated with median nerve 
      cross-sectional area (CSA) and nerve conduction measurements. RESULTS: The mean T2 
      values at the proximal carpal tunnel levels were higher in the CTS group (56.7 ms) 
      than in the control group (51.2 ms, P = .02) and also were higher than at the distal 
      carpal tunnel (51.0 ms, P < .001) and forearm levels (47.6 ms, P < .001). T2 values 
      were not significantly associated with CSA or nerve conduction measurements. 
      DISCUSSION: T2 mapping of the carpal tunnel provides qualitative information on 
      median nerve pathology but does not reflect CTS severity.

TI  - HIV Distal Neuropathic Pain Is Associated with Smaller Ventral Posterior Cingulate 
      Cortex.
PG  - 428-440
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnw180 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: . Despite modern antiretroviral therapy, HIV-associated neuropathy is one 
      of the most prevalent, disabling and treatment-resistant complications of HIV 
      disease. The presence and intensity of distal neuropathic pain is not fully 
      explained by the degree of peripheral nerve damage. A better understanding of brain 
      structure in HIV distal neuropathic pain may help explain why some patients with HIV 
      neuropathy report pain while the majority does not. Previously, we reported that 
      more intense distal neuropathic pain was associated with smaller total cerebral 
      cortical gray matter volumes. The objective of this study was to determine which 
      parts of the cortex are smaller. METHODS: . HIV positive individuals with and 
      without distal neuropathic pain enrolled in the multisite (N = 233) CNS HIV 
      Antiretroviral Treatment Effects (CHARTER) study underwent structural brain magnetic 
      resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate regional brain 
      volumes in these structural brain images. RESULTS: . Left ventral posterior 
      cingulate cortex was smaller for HIV positive individuals with versus without distal 
      neuropathic pain (peak P  = 0.017; peak t = 5.15; MNI coordinates x = -6, y = -54, 
      z = 20). Regional brain volumes within cortical gray matter structures typically 
      associated with pain processing were also smaller for HIV positive individuals 
      having higher intensity ratings of distal neuropathic pain. CONCLUSIONS: . The 
      posterior cingulate is thought to be involved in inhibiting the perception of 
      painful stimuli. Mechanistically a smaller posterior cingulate cortex structure may 
      be related to reduced anti-nociception contributing to increased distal neuropathic 
      pain.

TI  - The impact of spinal cord nerve roots and denticulate ligaments on cerebrospinal 
      fluid dynamics in the cervical spine.
PG  - e91888

AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in the spinal subarachnoid space (SSS) have been 
      thought to play an important pathophysiological role in syringomyelia, Chiari I 
      malformation (CM), and a role in intrathecal drug delivery. Yet, the impact that 
      fine anatomical structures, including nerve roots and denticulate ligaments (NRDL), 
      have on SSS CSF dynamics is not clear. In the present study we assessed the impact 
      of NRDL on CSF dynamics in the cervical SSS. The 3D geometry of the cervical SSS was 
      reconstructed based on manual segmentation of MRI images of a healthy volunteer and 
      a patient with CM. Idealized NRDL were designed and added to each of the geometries 
      based on in vivo measurments in the literature and confirmation by a neuroanatomist. 
      CFD simulations were performed for the healthy and patient case with and without 
      NRDL included. Our results showed that the NRDL had an important impact on CSF 
      dynamics in terms of velocity field and flow patterns. However, pressure 
      distribution was not altered greatly although the NRDL cases required a larger 
      pressure gradient to maintain the same flow. Also, the NRDL did not alter CSF 
      dynamics to a great degree in the SSS from the foramen magnum to the C1 level for 
      the healthy subject and CM patient with mild tonsillar herniation (∼ 6 mm). Overall, 
      the NRDL increased fluid mixing phenomena and resulted in a more complex flow field. 
      Comparison of the streamlines of CSF flow revealed that the presence of NRDL lead to 
      the formation of vortical structures and remarkably increased the local mixing of 
      the CSF throughout the SSS.

TI  - Evaluation of the carpal tunnel based on 3-D reconstruction from MRI.
PG  - 2222-9
AB  - While deviated wrist postures have been linked to the development of carpal tunnel 
      syndrome, the relative contributions of posture-related changes in size, shape and 
      volume of the carpal tunnel contribute to median nerve compression are unclear. The 
      purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to reconstruct the carpal tunnel from MRI 
      data in neutral and non-neutral (30 degrees extension, 30 degrees flexion) wrist 
      postures, and (2) to evaluate errors associated with off-axis imaging. 
      Three-dimensional reconstruction of the carpal tunnels of 8 volunteers from the 
      university community revealed that the orientation of the carpal tunnel was not 
      directly explained by external wrist angle. The average orientation of the carpal 
      tunnel was extended in all postures, ranging from 25 degrees +/-9 degrees in 
      extension, 13 degrees +/-5 degrees in neutral and 4 degrees +/-4 degrees in the 
      flexed wrist. Changing the orientation of the imaging plane to be perpendicular to 
      the reconstructed carpal tunnel revealed that axial images overestimated 
      cross-sectional area by an average of nearly 10% in extension, 4% in neutral and 
      less than 1% in flexion. Similarly, adjusting the imaging plane to be perpendicular 
      to external wrist angle overestimated cross-sectional area by an average of 2% in 
      extension, 4% in neutral and 24% in flexion. Distortion of the carpal tunnel shape 
      also became evident with rotation of the imaging plane. The data suggest that 
      correction for the orientation of the carpal tunnel itself to be more appropriate 
      than relying on external wrist angle. Computerized reconstruction provided detailed 
      anatomic visualization of the carpal tunnel, and has created the framework to 
      develop a biomechanical model of the carpal tunnel. Similar reconstruction of the 
      tissue structures passing through (median nerve and flexor tendons) and entering the 
      carpal tunnel (muscle tissue) will enable evaluation and partitioning of median 
      nerve injury mechanisms.

TI  - Magnetic resonance tractography of the lumbosacral plexus: Step-by-step.
PG  - e24646
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000024646 [doi]
AB  - MR tractography of the lumbosacral plexus (LSP) is challenging due to the difficulty 
      of acquiring high quality data and accurately estimating the neuronal tracts. We 
      proposed an algorithm for an accurate visualization and assessment of the major LSP 
      bundles using the segmentation of the cauda equina as seed points for the initial 
      starting area for the fiber tracking algorithm.Twenty-six healthy volunteers 
      underwent MRI examinations on a 3T MR scanner using the phased array coils with 
      optimized measurement protocols for diffusion-weighted images and coronal T2 
      weighted 3D short-term inversion recovery sampling perfection with application 
      optimized contrast using varying flip angle evaluation sequences used for LSP fiber 
      reconstruction and MR neurography (MRN).The fiber bundles reconstruction was 
      optimized in terms of eliminating the muscle fibers contamination using the 
      segmentation of cauda equina, the effects of the normalized quantitative anisotropy 
      (NQA) and angular threshold on reconstruction of the LSP. In this study, the NQA 
      parameter has been used for fiber tracking instead of fractional anisotropy (FA) and 
      the regions of interest positioning was precisely adjusted bilaterally and 
      symmetrically in each individual subject.The diffusion data were processed in 
      individual L3-S2 nerve fibers using the generalized Q-sampling imaging algorithm. 
      Data (mean FA, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity, and 
      normalized quantitative anisotropy) were statistically analyzed using the linear 
      mixed-effects model. The MR neurography was performed in MedINRIA and post-processed 
      using the maximum intensity projection method to demonstrate LSP tracts in multiple 
      planes.FA values significantly decreased towards the sacral region (P < .001); by 
      contrast, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity and NQA values 
      significantly increased towards the sacral region (P < .001).Fiber tractography of 
      the LSP was feasible in all examined subjects and closely corresponded with the 
      nerves visible in the maximum intensity projection images of MR neurography. Usage 
      of NQA instead of FA in the proposed algorithm enabled better separation of muscle 
      and nerve fibers.The presented algorithm yields a high quality reconstruction of the 
      LSP bundles that may be helpful both in research and clinical practice.

TI  - Early involvement of the spinal cord in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
PG  - 2664-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is poorly 
      understood. We have recently reported a significant reduction in spinal cord 
      cross-sectional area at the stage of clinically detectable DPN. In this study, we 
      investigated whether spinal cord atrophy occurs in early (subclinical) DPN. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty-one male type 1 diabetic subjects, 24 nondiabetic control 
      subjects, and 8 subjects with hereditary sensory motor neuropathy (HSMN) type 1A 
      underwent detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments. Diabetic subjects 
      were subsequently divided into three groups based on neuropathy severity (19 with no 
      DPN, 23 with subclinical DPN, and 39 with clinically detectable DPN). All subjects 
      underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and cord area 
      measurements at disc level C2/C3. RESULTS: Mean corrected spinal cord area index 
      (SCAI) (corrected for age, height, and weight) was 67.5 mm [95% CI 64.1-70.9] in 
      diabetic subjects without DPN. Those with subclinical (62.4 mm [59.5-65.3]) and 
      clinically detectable DPN (57.2 mm [54.9-59.6]) had lower mean SCAIs compared with 
      subjects with no DPN (P = 0.03 and P < 0.001, respectively). No significant 
      difference was found between diabetic subjects without DPN and nondiabetic control 
      subjects (69.2 mm [66.3-72.0], P = 0.47). Mean SCAIs in subjects with HSMN type 1A 
      (71.07 mm [65.3-76.9]) were not significantly different from those for nondiabetic 
      control subjects and diabetic subjects without DPN. Among diabetic subjects, SCAI 
      was significantly related to sural sensory conduction velocities and the Neuropathy 
      Composite and Symptom Scores. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord involvement occurs early in 
      DPN. There is also a significant relation between reduction in SCAI and 
      neurophysiological assessments of DPN.

TI  - Spinal cord tumors: gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging.
PG  - 469-74
AB  - To assess the utility of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) and of MR imaging in the evaluation of 
      spinal cord tumors, ten consecutive patients were prospectively evaluated. T1-proton 
      density-, and T2-weighted images were obtained in sagittal or axial planes. 
      T1-weighted images were obtained before and after intravenous administration. Five 
      tumors were within the cervical spinal cord; 3 neoplasms were within the thoracic 
      cord; 1 neoplasm extended from the cervical to the thoracic cord and 1 neoplasm 
      extended from the cervical cord to the conus medullaris. Four tumors were 
      ependymomas; 3 were astrocytomas; 1 was an hemangioblastoma, and 1 was a metastatic 
      malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The remaining patient died prior to spinal 
      surgery and no autopsy was obtained. Of the precontrast sequences, tumors were best 
      evaluated using T1-weighted images. Abnormal findings included cord widening, 
      presence of a tumor mass, intratumoral or other associated cyst(s), and hemorrhage. 
      Nevertheless, T1-weighted images obtained following the administration of GD were 
      superior relative to all other pre- and post-contrast sequences for defining tumor 
      margins, characterizing cyst(s) and delineating tumor masses. Based primarily on 
      their appearance on post-contrast T1-weighted images, tumor-associated cysts could 
      be subcategorized into 3 types: intratumoral cysts (found within the 
      contrast-enhancing soft tissue mass); nonenhancing extratumoral cysts (found 
      eitherrostral or caudal to the enhancing tumor mass); and enhancing extratumoral 
      cysts (having an enhancing wall or containing an enhancing nodule).(ABSTRACT

TI  - Microstructural Abnormalities in Gray Matter of Patients with Postherpetic 
      Neuralgia: A Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging Study.
PG  - E601-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Changes in functional activity and connectivity have been shown in 
      patients experiencing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) pain. However, PHN-induced 
      structural changes, particularly in the gray matter of which volume and density was 
      widely reported to be altered by other chronic pain, have not been well 
      characterized. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to detect the difference in the 
      microstructure of gray matter of PHN patients as compared to the healthy controls, 
      and to analyze the correlation between microstructural alterations and clinical 
      features of PHN patients. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: University 
      hospital. METHODS: Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) was performed in 19 patients 
      with PHN and in 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Maps of axial kurtosis 
      (K//), mean kurtosis (MK), radial kurtosis (K) in gray matter were calculated and 
      compared between the 2 groups. Correlations between kurtosis metrics in the regions 
      where between-group difference was detected and pain intensity as well as lesion 
      duration were tested by Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: Compared with healthy 
      controls, PHN patients exhibited significantly decreased DKI parameters in the 
      bilateral insula and superior temporal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus and 
      occipital lobe, right cerebellum anterior lobe, right thalamus, caudate and 
      parahippocampal gyrus. K// in the bilateral insula and MK in the right insula were 
      negatively correlated with visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of PHN patients, 
      whereas no correlation was found between DKI parameters and lesion duration of PHN 
      pain. LIMITATION: Relatively small sample size. We still cannot determine the causal 
      and effect relationship between the microstructural abnormalities in the gray matter 
      and PHN. CONCLUSIONS: DKI can specifically reflect pathophysiological 
      microstructural alterations in the cerebral gray matters of PHN patients. This 
      feature enables magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to be a potentially valuable 
      technique for objectively estimating the severity of PHN pain, which would provide 
      an opportunity for elucidating the central mechanisms underlying PHN as well. KEY

TI  - Automation of Quantifying Axonal Loss in Patients with Peripheral Neuropathies 
      through Deep Learning Derived Muscle Fat Fraction.
PG  - 1539-1549
LID - 10.1002/jmri.27508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Axonal loss denervates muscle, leading to an increase of fat 
      accumulation in the muscle. Therefore, fat fraction (FF) in whole limb muscle using 
      MRI has emerged as a monitoring biomarker for axonal loss in patients with 
      peripheral neuropathies. In this study, we are testing whether deep learning-based 
      model can automate quantification of the FF in individual muscles. While individual 
      muscle is smaller with irregular shape, manually segmented muscle MRI images have 
      been accumulated in this lab; and make the deep learning feasible. PURPOSE: To 
      automate segmentation on muscle MRI images through deep learning for quantifying 
      individual muscle FF in patients with peripheral neuropathies. STUDY TYPE: 
      Retrospective. SUBJECTS: 24 patients and 19 healthy controls. FIELD 
      STRENGTH/SEQUENCES: 3T; Interleaved 3D GRE. ASSESSMENT: A 3D U-Net model was 
      implemented in segmenting muscle MRI images. This was enabled by leveraging a large 
      set of manually segmented muscle MRI images. B(1) (+) and B(1) (-) maps were used to 
      correct image inhomogeneity. Accuracy of the automation was evaluated using Pixel 
      Accuracy (PA), Dice Coefficient (DC) in binary masks; and Bland-Altman and Pearson 
      correlation by comparing FF values between manual and automated methods. STATISTICAL 
      TESTS: PA and DC were reported with their median value and standard deviation. Two 
      methods were compared using the ± 95% confidence intervals (CI) of Bland-Altman 
      analysis and the Pearson's coefficient (r(2) ). RESULTS: DC values were from 
      0.83 ± 0.17 to 0.98 ± 0.02 in thigh and from 0.63 ± 0.18 to 0.96 ± 0.02 in calf 
      muscles. For FF values, the overall ± 95% CI and r(2) were [0.49, -0.56] and 0.989 
      in thigh and [0.84, -0.71] and 0.971 in the calf. DATA CONCLUSION: Automated results 
      well agreed with the manual results in quantifying FF for individual muscles. This 
      method mitigates the formidable time consumption and intense labor in manual 
      segmentations; and enables the use of individual muscle FF as outcome measures in 
      upcoming longitudinal studies. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 1.

TI  - Radiculopathy in degenerative lumbar scoliosis: correlation of stenosis with relief 
      from selective nerve root steroid injections.
PG  - 45-50
LID - 10.1111/j.1526-4637.2010.01000.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose is to define the origin of radiculopathy of patients with 
      degenerative lumbar scoliosis-stenosis and to assess the correlation between 
      percentage of initial radicular leg pain relief with selective nerve root injections 
      and lateral canal dimensions. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. SETTING AND 
      PATIENTS: Thirty-six consecutive patients (average age 72) from Twin Cities Spine 
      Center with degenerative lumbar scoliosis (average major curve 25°) and radicular 
      symptoms were studied. INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent 46 selective steroid 
      injections of nerve roots concordant with clinical symptomatology. OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Radiographic measurements included major and lumbosacral curve Cobb angle. 
      Computerized measurements of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) included minimum 
      subarticular height and foramen cross-sectional area of the nerve roots that were 
      injected. Initial response from the nerve root injections was also rated. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-five percent of nerve root symptoms were coming from the major curve, 72.2% 
      from the lumbosacral hemicurve and 2.8% from both (P<0.001). The affected nerve 
      roots were more frequently the L4 (34.8%) and L5 (28.3%) nerve roots. A total of 
      71.7% of radicular symptoms were originating from the concavity of the curve and 
      28.7% from the convexity (P<0.001). The relief from injections was more than 50% in 
      75% of the patients at 15 days postinjection. There was no statistical significant 
      correlation (P>0.05) between the lateral canal dimensions and the initial response 
      to injection of anesthetic plus steroid injection. CONCLUSIONS: In degenerative 
      lumbar scoliotic curves, radicular symptoms are attributed mainly to nerve roots 
      exiting from the concavity of the lumbosacral hemicurve. No evidence was found that 
      the rate of initial relief from selective nerve root injections correlates with the 
      degree of stenosis noted in the MRI.

TI  - Transient central nervous system white matter abnormality in X-linked 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
PG  - 429-34
AB  - X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy 
      caused by mutations in the connexin 32 (Cx32) gene. Cx32 is widely expressed in 
      brain and peripheral nerve, yet clinical manifestations of CMTX mainly arise from 
      peripheral neuropathy. We have evaluated two male patients with CMTX who on separate 
      occasions developed transient ataxia, dysarthria, and weakness within 3 days of 
      returning from ski trips at altitudes above 8,000 feet. Magnetic resonance imaging 
      studies in both patients showed nonenhancing, confluent, and symmetrical white 
      matter abnormalities that were more pronounced posteriorly and that resolved over 
      several months. Magnetic transfer images in one patient demonstrated increased 
      magnetization transfer ratios distinct from that seen in demyelination or edema. 
      Both patients returned to their normal baseline within 2 to 3 weeks. These cases 
      suggest that CMTX patients are at risk for developing an acute, transient, 
      neurological syndrome when they travel to places at high altitudes and return to sea 
      level. Cx32 mutations may cause central nervous system dysfunction by reducing the 
      number of functioning gap junctions between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, making 
      both cells more susceptible to abnormalities of intercellular exchange of ions and 
      small molecules in situations of metabolic stress.

AB  - Accumulated evidence from experimental animal models suggests that neuronal loss 
      within the dorsal horn is involved in the development and/or maintenance of 
      peripheral neuropathic pain. However, to date, no study has specifically 
      investigated whether such neuroanatomical changes also occur at this level in 
      humans. Using brain imaging techniques, we sought to determine whether anatomical 
      changes were present in the spinal trigeminal nucleus in subjects with chronic 
      orofacial neuropathic pain. In 22 subjects with painful trigeminal neuropathy and 44 
      pain-free controls, voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted anatomical images and 
      diffusion tensor images were used to assess regional gray matter volume and 
      microstructural changes within the brainstem. In addition, deterministic 
      tractography was used to assess the integrity of ascending pain pathways. Orofacial 
      neuropathic pain was associated with significant regional gray matter volume 
      decreases, fractional anisotropy increases, and mean diffusivity decreases within 
      the spinal trigeminal nucleus, specifically the subnucleus oralis. In addition, 
      tractography revealed no significant differences in diffusivity properties in the 
      root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve, the spinal trigeminal tract, or the ventral 
      trigeminothalamic tracts in painful trigeminal neuropathy subjects compared with 
      controls. These data reveal that chronic neuropathic pain in humans is associated 
      with discrete alterations in the anatomy of the primary synapse. These 
      neuroanatomical changes may be critical for the generation and/or maintenance of 
      pathological pain.

TI  - Mapping the peripheral nervous system in the whole mouse via compressed sensing 
      tractography.
LID - 10.1088/1741-2552/ac0089 [doi]
AB  - Objective.The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the central nervous system 
      with the rest of the body to regulate many physiological functions and is 
      therapeutically targeted to treat diseases such as epilepsy, depression, intestinal 
      dysmotility, chronic pain, and more. However, we still lack understanding of PNS 
      innervation in most organs because the large span, diffuse nature, and small 
      terminal nerve bundle fibers have precluded whole-organism, high resolution mapping 
      of the PNS. We sought to produce a comprehensive peripheral nerve atlas for use in 
      future interrogation of neural circuitry and selection of targets for 
      neuromodulation.Approach.We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging 
      (DT-MRI) with high-speed compressed sensing to generate a tractogram of the whole 
      mouse PNS. The tractography generated from the DT-MRI data is validated using 
      lightsheet microscopy on optically cleared, antibody stained tissue.Main 
      results.Herein we demonstrate the first comprehensive PNS tractography in a whole 
      mouse. Using this technique, we scanned the whole mouse in 28 h and mapped PNS 
      innervation and fiber network in multiple organs including heart, lung, liver, 
      kidneys, stomach, intestines, and bladder at 70µm resolution. This whole-body PNS 
      tractography map has provided unparalleled information; for example, it delineates 
      the innervation along the gastrointestinal tract by multiple sacral levels and by 
      the vagal nerves. The map enabled a quantitative tractogram that revealed relative 
      innervation of the major organs by each vertebral foramen as well as the vagus 
      nerve.Significance.This novel high-resolution nerve atlas provides a potential 
      roadmap for future neuromodulation therapies and other investigations into the 
      neural circuits which drive homeostasis and disease throughout the body.

TI  - Fractional anisotropy thresholding for deterministic tractography of the roots of 
      the brachial plexus.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-79840-8 [doi]
LID - 80
AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) and 
      estimates of diffusivity are sensitive to the microstructure of peripheral nerves 
      and may be displayed as tractograms. However, the ideal conditions for tractography 
      of the roots of the brachial plexus are unclear, which represents the rationale for 
      this study. Ten healthy adults were scanned using a Siemens Prisma (3T) and 
      single-shot echo-planar imaging (b-value 0/1000 s/mm(2), 64 directions, 2.5 mm(3) 
      with 4 averages; repeated in opposing phase encoding directions). Susceptibility 
      correction and tractography were performed in DSI Studio by two independent raters. 
      The effect of FA thresholding at increments of 0.01 (from 0.04 to 0.10) were tested. 
      The mean FA varied between subjects by 2% (95% CI 1%, 3%). FA thresholds of 0.04, 
      0.05 and 0.06 all propagated 96% of tracts representing the roots; thresholding at 
      0.07 yielded 4% fewer tracts (p = 0.2), 0.08 yielded 11% fewer tracts (p = 0.008), 
      0.09 yielded 15% fewer tracts (p = 0.001) and 0.1 yielded 20% fewer tracts 
      (p < 0.001). There was < 0.1% inter-rater variability in the measured FA and 99% 
      agreement for tractography (κ = 0.92, p < 0.001). The fractional anisotropy 
      thresholds required to generate tractograms of the roots of the brachial plexus 
      appears to be lower than those used in the brain. We provide estimates of the 
      probability of generating true tracts for each spinal nerve root of the brachial 
      plexus, at different fractional anisotropy thresholds.

TI  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Sciatic Nerve as a Surrogate Marker for Nerve 
      Functionality of the Upper and Lower Limb in Patients With Diabetes and Prediabetes.
PG  - 642589
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2021.642589 [doi]
LID - 642589
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy (DN) is assumed to begin in the 
      distal legs with a subsequent progression to hands and arms at later stages. In 
      contrast, recent studies have found that lower limb nerve lesions in DN predominate 
      at the proximal sciatic nerve and that, in the upper limb, nerve functions can be 
      impaired at early stages of DN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, 
      single-center cross-sectional study, participants underwent diffusion-weighted 3 
      Tesla magnetic resonance neurography in order to calculate the sciatic nerve's 
      fractional anisotropy (FA), a surrogate parameter for structural nerve integrity. 
      Results were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological assessments of the 
      lower limb and an examination of hand function derived from the Purdue Pegboard 
      Test. RESULTS: Overall, 71 patients with diabetes, 11 patients with prediabetes and 
      25 age-matched control subjects took part in this study. In patients with diabetes, 
      the sciatic nerve's FA showed positive correlations with tibial and peroneal nerve 
      conduction velocities (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and r = 0.56; p < 0.001, respectively), 
      and tibial and peroneal nerve compound motor action potentials (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 
      and r = 0.63; p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the sciatic nerve's FA was 
      correlated with the Pegboard Test results in patients with diabetes (r = 0.52; p < 
      0.001), prediabetes (r = 0.76; p < 0.001) and in controls (r = 0.79; p = 0.007). 
      CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that the sciatic nerve's FA is a 
      surrogate marker for functional and electrophysiological parameters of both upper 
      and lower limbs in patients with diabetes and prediabetes, suggesting that nerve 
      damage in these patients is not restricted to the level of the symptomatic limbs but 
      rather affects the entire peripheral nervous system.

TI  - Clinical Features and Brain MRI Findings in Korean Patients with AGel Amyloidosis.
PG  - 431-438
LID - 10.3349/ymj.2021.62.5.431 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: AGel amyloidosis is systemic amyloidosis caused by pathogenic variants in 
      the GSN gene. In this study, we sought to characterize the clinical and brain 
      magnetic resonance image (MRI) features of Korean patients with AGel amyloidosis. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 13 patients with AGel amyloidosis from three 
      unrelated families. Brain MRIs were performed in eight patients and eight age- and 
      sex-matched healthy controls. Therein, we analyzed gray and white matter content 
      using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and 
      FreeSurfer. RESULTS: The median age at examination was 73 (interquartile range: 
      64-76) years. The median age at onset of cutis laxa was 20 (interquartile range: 
      15-30) years. All patients over that age of 60 years had dysarthria, cutis laxa, 
      dysphagia, and facial palsy. Two patients in their 30s had only mild cutis laxa. The 
      median age at dysarthria onset was 66 (interquartile range: 63.5-70) years. 
      Ophthalmoparesis was observed in three patients. No patient presented with muscle 
      weakness of the limbs. Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images of the brain 
      showed no significant differences between the patient and control groups. Also, 
      analysis of VBM, TBSS, and FreeSurfer revealed no significant differences in 
      cortical thickness between patients and healthy controls at the corrected 
      significance level. CONCLUSION: Our study outlines the clinical manifestations of 
      prominent bulbar palsy and early-onset cutis laxa in 13 Korean patients with AGel 
      amyloidosis and confirms that AGel amyloidosis mainly affects the peripheral nervous 
      system rather than the central nervous system.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study reports on a patient who developed degeneration of an injured 
      spinothalamic tract (STT) detected on diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) following 
      mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old female had 
      suffered from head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident. The patient did 
      not experience loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia and the patient's 
      Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. She had begun to feel pain in her left hand and 
      foot at ~ 7 days after onset. The characteristics and severity of pain were as 
      follows: constant tingling and pricking sensation without allodynia or hyperalgesia 
      (Visual Analogue Scale score: 3~4). No specific focal lesion was observed on brain 
      and spine MRI and an electromyography study showed no evidence of peripheral nerve 
      injury or radiculopathy. At 6 months after onset, the central pain in the left hand 
      and foot became aggravated, with a Visual Analogue Scale score of 6. RESULTS: On 
      1-month DTT, partial tearing was observed in both STTs. In contrast, both partially 
      torn STTs had become atrophy on 9-month DTT. CONCLUSIONS: This study recommends 
      further studies conducted on the prognosis (regeneration or degeneration) of injured 
      STTs and on the effect of change of an injured STT on central pain.

TI  - MRI Findings in Patients with Clinical Onset Consistent with Infantile Neuroaxonal 
      Dystrophy (INAD), Literature Review, Clinical and MRI Follow-up.
PG  - 202-14
AB  - Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) is a rare autosomal recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by infantile onset and rapid progression of 
      psychomotor regression and hypotonia evolving into spasticity. The neuroradiologic 
      hallmark of the disease is represented by progressive cerebellar atrophy. Prior to 
      the discovery of mutations in the PLA2G6 gene in family with INAD, the clinical 
      diagnosis of the disease had been confirmed by the presence of spheroid bodies (SB) 
      in a peripheral nerve biopsy. Various studies have found that some patients with 
      mutations lacked SB and some without mutations had SB, indicating incomplete 
      detection using either pathologic or molecular methods (7). This, together with the 
      observation that the spectrum of clinical features associated with mutations in 
      PLA2G6 is broader than previously described, has increased the usefulness of 
      Magnetic Resonance (MR) in INAD diagnosis, particularly in the frequent occurrence 
      of atypical cases, especially in the early stages of the disease. We retrospectively 
      reviewed the MR studies of eight patients in whom clinical and imaging onset met the 
      typical criteria for INAD. Their clinical and MR imaging (MRI) onset and follow-up 
      were evaluated together with the neuroradiological findings reported in the 
      literature in order to identify MRI features useful in differentiating INAD from 
      other diseases with similar clinical onset and to discuss which of them are the most 
      important, thus suggesting INAD diagnosis. Our contribution included the use of 
      Proton Spectroscopy ((1)H-MR), diffusion weighted MR imaging (DWI) and diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) in the follow-up of seven of the eight patients. The literature 
      reviewed included attempts to correlate clinical and MR data with the genotype in 
      the group of patients carrying PLA2G6 mutations. From the limited and inhomogeneous 
      cohort of patients included in our study, a correlation between the MR features, 
      phenotype and genotype was not exhaustive.

AB  - Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that occur commonly in 
      individuals with neurocutaneous disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1. Vagal 
      nerve neurofibromas, however, are a relatively rare occurrence. We present the case 
      of a 22-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with a neurofibroma of the left 
      cervical vagal nerve. The mass was resected through an anterior approach without 
      major event. In the postoperative course, the patient developed left vocal cord 
      paralysis treated with medialization with injectable gel. We then present a 
      comprehensive review of the literature for surgical resection of vagal nerve 
      neurofibromas.

TI  - Acute and bilateral blindness due to optic neuropathy associated with copper 
      deficiency.
PG  - 1025-7
LID - 10.1001/archneurol.2009.70 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acquired copper deficiency in adults is associated with a subacute to 
      chronic progressive myeloneuropathy and optic neuropathy. OBJECTIVE: To describe an 
      individual after gastric bypass surgery who developed a chronic progressive 
      myeloneuropathy, an acute optic neuropathy, along with anemia and leukopenia. 
      DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Academic center. Patient A 55-year-old woman, 
      following gastric bypass surgery 22 years earlier, developed progressive numbness, 
      weakness, and sphincter disturbance over 6 years. She awoke one morning with 
      bilateral blindness. Examination findings showed evidence of severe myelopathy and 
      peripheral neuropathy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic resonance imaging, optical 
      coherence tomography, electrophysiologic studies, nerve and muscle biopsy specimens, 
      and vision testing. RESULTS: Over 1 year of follow-up, copper infusion therapy 
      seemed to stabilize the progressive myeloneuropathy and improved leukopenia and 
      anemia. It had no effect on the optic neuropathy. Optic nerve tissue injury was 
      observed on magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and on optical coherence 
      tomography. CONCLUSIONS: Copper deficiency should be considered in cases of atypical 
      optic neuropathy. Serum copper levels should be monitored in patients with a 
      compatible neurologic syndrome who have undergone gastric bypass surgery. Although 
      visual acuity did not improve after copper infusion in our patient, prompt 
      recognition of copper deficiency may prevent further deterioration.

TI  - Foot small muscle atrophy is present before the detection of clinical neuropathy.
PG  - 1425-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize structural changes and the metabolic profile of foot 
      muscles and correlate them with diabetic neuropathy measurements using phosphorus-31 
      ((31)P) rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 12 control subjects, 9 
      non-neuropathic diabetic patients, and 12 neuropathic diabetic patients using (31)P 
      RARE and proton ((1)H) MRI at 3 Tesla. The ratio of the total cross-sectional area 
      of the foot to that of the muscle tissue was calculated from transaxial (1)H and 
      (31)P images. The average (31)P concentration across the metatarsal head region was 
      measured from the (31)P images. RESULTS: The muscle area-to-total area ratio 
      differed among all three groups (means +/- SD): 0.55 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.05 vs. 
      0.06 +/- 0.06 for control, non-neuropathic, and neuropathic subjects, respectively 
      (P < 0.0001). The average (31)P concentration also differed among all groups: 27.7 
      +/- 3.8 vs. 21.7 +/- 4.8 vs. 7.9 +/- 8.8 mmol/l for control, non-neuropathic, and 
      neuropathic subjects (P < 0.0001). The muscle area-to-total area ratio strongly 
      correlated with clinical measurements: Neuropathy Disability Score, r = -0.83, P < 
      0.0001; vibration perception threshold, r = -0.79, P < 0.0001; and Semmes-Weinstein 
      monofilaments, r = -0.87, P < 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Small muscle atrophy is present 
      in diabetes before clinical peripheral neuropathy can be detected using standard 
      clinical techniques. The (31)P RARE MRI method evaluates the severity of muscle 
      atrophy, even in the early stages when neuropathy is absent. This technique may 
      prove to be a useful diagnostic tool in identifying early-stage diabetic foot 
      problems.

AB  - Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders 
      present at birth with muscle weakness, hypotonia and contractures. Congenital 
      muscular dystrophy (CMD) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders with muscle 
      weakness, hypotonia and contractures present at birth. A particular subset of 
      classic CMD is characterized by a complete absence of merosin. Merosin-deficient 
      congenital muscular dystrophy (MDCMD) is a rare genetic disease involving the 
      central and peripheral nervous system in the childhood. High signal intensities are 
      often observed throughout the centrum semiovale, periventricular, and sub-cortical 
      white matters on T2-weighted images in MRI brain in children with MDCMD. Apparent 
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) map may reveal increased signal intensity and apparent 
      diffusion coefficient values in the periventricular and deep white matters. These 
      white matter findings, observed in late infancy, decrease in severity with age. The 
      pathogenesis of these changes remains uncertain at present. In this article, we 
      outline the specific MR imaging findings seen in a patient with documented MDCMD and 
      also suggest the causes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to test the prognostic significance of 
      intraoperative changes in the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the volume of the optic 
      chiasma and their correlation with visual outcome. METHODS Twenty-eight sequential 
      patients with suprasellar tumors presenting with chiasma compression syndrome were 
      surgically treated under intraoperative MRI control between March 2014 and July 
      2016. The FA and the volume of the optic chiasma were measured immediately before 
      and immediately after tumor resection. The visual impairment score (VIS) was used to 
      quantify the severity of the ophthalmological disturbances before surgery, 10-14 
      days after surgery, and again 3 months thereafter. The change in the FA and the 
      volume of the optic chiasma was correlated to the improvement of vision. The 
      correlation between other predictors such as the age of the patients and the 
      duration of symptoms and the visual outcome was tested. RESULTS The VIS improved 
      significantly after surgery. The FA values of the optic chiasma decreased 
      significantly after decompression, whereas the volume of the optic chiasma increased 
      significantly after decompression. The early and delayed improvement of vision was 
      strongly correlated to the decrease in the average FA and the increase of the volume 
      of the optic chiasma. The duration of symptoms showed a significant negative 
      correlation to the visual outcome. However, the decrease in the FA showed the 
      strongest correlation to the improvement of the VIS, followed by the expansion of 
      the optic chiasma, and then the duration of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The decrease in 
      the FA and the expansion of the optic chiasma after its decompression are strong 
      early predictors of the visual outcome. These parameters are also able to predict 
      delayed improvement of vision.

TI  - Quantitative T(2) -mapping magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of muscle motor 
      unit recruitment patterns.
PG  - 703-709
LID - 10.1002/mus.27186 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this study, we aimed to determine whether muscle transverse 
      relaxation time (T(2) ) magnetic resonance (MR) mapping results correlate with motor 
      unit loss, as defined by motor unit recruitment patterns on electromyography (EMG). 
      METHODS: EMG and 3-Tesla MRI exams were acquired no more than 31 days apart in 
      subjects referred for peripheral nerve MRI. Two musculoskeletal radiologists 
      qualitatively graded T(2) -weighted, fat-suppressed sequences for severity of muscle 
      edema-like patterns and manually placed regions of interest within muscles to obtain 
      T(2) values from T(2) -mapping sequences. Concordance was calculated between 
      qualitative and quantitative MR grades and EMG recruitment categories (none, 
      discrete, decreased) as well as interobserver agreement for both MR grades. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-four muscles (21 abnormal, 13 control) were assessed in 13 subjects (5 
      females and 8 males; mean age, 46 years) with 14 EMG-MRI pairs. T(2) -relaxation 
      times were significantly (P < .001) increased in all EMG recruitment categories 
      compared with control muscles. T(2) differences were not significant between EMG 
      grades of motor unit recruitment (P = .151-.702). T(2) and EMG score concordance was 
      acceptable (Harrell's concordance index [c index]: rater A, 0.71; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.51-0.87; rater B, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-0.91). Qualitative MRI and EMG 
      score concordance was poor to acceptable (c index: rater A, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50-0.79; 
      rater B, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89). T(2) values had moderate-to-substantial ability 
      to distinguish between absent vs incomplete (ie, decreased or discrete) motor unit 
      recruitment (c index: rater A, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50-1.00; rater B, 0.86; 95% CI, 
      0.57-1.00). DISCUSSION: Quantitative T(2) MR muscle mapping is a promising tool for 
      noninvasive evaluation of the degree of motor unit recruitment loss.

TI  - Spinal cord neural anatomy in rats examined by in vivo magnetic resonance 
      microscopy.
PG  - 589-99
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) is a technique that 
      is worthwhile for anesthesiologists because it allows spinal cord and plexus anatomy 
      to be visualized three dimensionally and followed over time in the same animal. For 
      example, the long-term effect of indwelling intrathecal or plexus catheters can be 
      studied in situ, and convective and diffusive forces within intrathecal, epidural, 
      or nerve sheath spaces can be investigated. Further, diffusion-weighted MRM, which 
      measures an "apparent diffusion coefficient" (ADC), can be used to track the 
      presence of ischemia, hypoperfusion, or cytotoxic edema. This study investigates 
      problems associated with the use of in vivo MRM for spinal cord and peripheral nerve 
      studies in the rat. METHODS: Twenty-one anesthetized female Fisher CDF rats were 
      used. Group 1 (n=7) was used for anatomic three-dimensional studies. Groups 2 (n=4), 
      3 (n=4), and 4 (n=6) were used for measurements of the ADC. Group 2 served as 
      controls, group 3 received lumbar intrathecal catheters, and group 4 received 
      cervical intrathecal catheters. RESULTS: Cervical spine, lumbar spine, and spinal 
      nerves and ganglia were accurately visualized with MRM. As a rule, spinal cord gray 
      and white matter were better demonstrated using diffusion-weighted proton stains. By 
      contrast, T2-weighted proton staining superiorly demonstrated structures surrounding 
      the spinal cord. In groups 3 and 4, indwelling intrathecal catheters did not affect 
      the spinal cord ADC, indicating normal blood flow and no cytotoxic edema. Contrast 
      studies revealed nonhomogeneous distribution of contrast predominately in the 
      lateral and ventral intrathecal space. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional 
      diffusion-weighted MRM displays cervical and lumbar spine anatomy accurately in 
      vivo. Apparent diffusion coefficients measurements are feasible in rat cervical 
      spinal cord with intrathecal catheters. Spinal cord ADCs are unaffected by 
      intrathecal catheters, indicating normal spinal cord perfusion.

TI  - A robust and reliable method for detecting signals of interest in multiexponential 
      decays.
PG  - 055106
LID - 10.1063/1.2930799 [doi]
AB  - The concept of rejecting the null hypothesis for definitively detecting a signal was 
      extended to relaxation spectrum space for multiexponential reconstruction. The novel 
      test was applied to the problem of detecting the myelin signal, which is believed to 
      have a time constant below 40 ms, in T2 decays from magnetic resonance imagining of 
      the human brain. It was demonstrated that the test allowed the detection of a signal 
      in a relaxation spectrum by using only the information in the data, thus avoiding 
      any potentially unreliable prior information. The test was implemented both 
      explicitly and implicitly for simulated T2 measurements. For the explicit 
      implementation, the null hypothesis was that a relaxation spectrum existed that had 
      no signal below 40 ms and that was consistent with the T2 decay. The confidence 
      level by which the null hypothesis could be rejected gave the confidence level that 
      there was signal below the 40 ms time constant. The explicit implementation assessed 
      the test's performance with and without prior information where the prior 
      information was the non-negative relaxation spectrum assumption. The test was also 
      implemented implicitly with a data conserving multiexponential reconstruction 
      algorithm that used left invertible matrices and that has been published previously. 
      The implicit and explicit implementations demonstrated similar characteristics in 
      detecting the myelin signal in both the simulated and experimental T2 decays, 
      providing additional evidence to support the close link between the two tests. When 
      the relaxation spectrum was assumed to be non-negative, the novel test required 
      signal to noise ratios (SNRs) approaching 1000 in the T2 decays for detection of the 
      myelin signal with high confidence. When the relaxation spectrum was not assumed to 
      be non-negative, the SNR requirements for a detection with high confidence increased 
      by a factor of 25. The application of the test to a T2 decay from human white 
      matter, measured in vivo with a SNR of 650, demonstrated a solid detection of the 
      signal below 40 ms believed to be due to the myelin water. This study demonstrated 
      the robustness and reliability of extending the concept of rejecting the null 
      hypothesis to relaxation spectrum space. The study also raised serious questions 
      about the susceptibility to false positive detection of the myelin signal of the 
      multiexponential reconstruction algorithms currently in use.

TI  - Novel Compound Heterozygous Spatacsin Mutations in a Greek Kindred with Hereditary 
      Spastic Paraplegia SPG11 and Dementia.
PG  - 373-81
LID - 10.1159/000444715 [doi]
AB  - SPG11 belongs to the autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) and 
      presents during childhood or puberty with a complex clinical phenotype encompassing 
      learning difficulties, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, and mental 
      retardation. We hereby present the case of a 30-year-old female patient with complex 
      autosomal recessive HSP with thinning of the corpus callosum (TCC) and dementia that 
      was compound heterozygous with two novel mutations in the SPG11 gene. Sequence 
      analysis of the SPG11 gene revealed two novel mutations in a compound heterozygous 
      state in the index patient (c.2431C>T/p.Gln811Ter and 
      c.6755_6756insT/p.Glu2252Aspfs*88). MRI showed abnormal TCC, white matter (WM) 
      hyperintensities periventricularly, and the 'ears of the lynx' sign. Diffusion 
      tensor imaging showed a mild-to-moderate decrease in fractional anisotropy and an 
      increase in mean diffusivity in WM compared to age-matched controls, while magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy showed abnormal findings in affected WM with a decrease in 
      N-acetyl-aspartate in WM regions of interest. This is the first SPG11 kindred from 
      the Greek population to be reported in the medical literature.

TI  - Localization of neurovascular bundles on pelvic CT and evaluation of radiation dose 
      to structures putatively involved in erectile dysfunction after prostate 
      brachytherapy.
PG  - 426-35
AB  - PURPOSE: To (a) locate neurovascular bundles (NVB) on pelvic CT and (b) 
      retrospectively evaluate relationships between radiation dose to structures 
      putatively involved in prostate brachytherapy-induced erectile dysfunction (ED) and 
      incidence of postbrachytherapy ED. METHODS AND MATERIALS: (a) Right/left NVB were 
      identified on nine prostate MRIs. Structures visible on MRI and CT were 
      cross-referenced. Cross-sectional area of each NVB was measured. (b) All patients 
      treated with implant alone and whose treatment was planned on Variseed (Varian 
      Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA), with follow-up of >12 months were included; n = 41. 
      Median follow-up was 20 months. All patients were potent (+/- sildenafil) before 
      implant (erection sufficient for intercourse). The right/left NVB (using results 
      from part "a"), penile bulb, and right/left crus were outlined on postimplant CT. 
      Volumes and doses to these structures were calculated. RESULTS: (a) On prostate MRI, 
      NVB was consistently located where the prostate border bends away from the levator 
      ani, at the gland's smallest radius of curvature. Average area of the circle best 
      encompassing the NVB = 0.27 cm(2); diameter was 0.58 cm. (b) 11 of 41 (27%) patients 
      had ED; 30 of 41 were potent (15 with sildenafil). There was no significant 
      difference between potent/impotent patients in isotope, age, diabetes, hypertension, 
      follow-up, or volume of prostate, bulb, right/left NVB, or right/left crus. There 
      was a relationship between smoking and ED (p = 0.05). There was a relationship 
      between bulb %D90 and ED: >10% 67% (4 of 6) vs. <10% 20% (7 of 35) (p = 0.03), which 
      remained when controlling for smoking. There was no relationship between dose to 
      left NVB and potency. There was paradoxical decreased risk of ED with right NVB 
      %V100 >60% (p = 0.019), and right NVB %D60 >100% (p = 0.003). There was no 
      relationship between dose to right/left crus and ED. CONCLUSIONS: A reliable method 
      for localizing NVB on CT is demonstrated. There is no increased risk of prostate 
      brachytherapy-induced ED with increasing dose to crus or NVB at the doses given in 
      this study. There is a possible dose-response relationship between dose to the bulb 
      and risk of ED.

TI  - Repeated hypoglycemia and cognitive decline. A case report.
PG  - 54-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus has a high incidence in general population and goes by 
      high morbidity by specific micro vascular pathology in the retina, renal glomerul 
      and peripheral nerves. In type 1 DM, intensive therapy can prevent or delay the 
      development of long-term complications associated with DM but hypoglycaemia 
      especially severe hypoglycaemia defined, as a low blood glucose resulting in stupor, 
      seizure, or unconsciousness that precludes self-treatment is a serious threat. 
      Hypoglycaemia that may preferentially harm neurons in the medial temporal region, 
      specifically the hippocampus, is a potential danger for the brain cognitive function 
      which several studies failed to detect any significant effects, whereas others 
      indicated an influence on it. A young diabetic case presented here with severe 
      cognitive defect. Great number of severe hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic attacks and 
      convulsion episodes were described in his medical history. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 
      Neuroradiologic findings on CT and MRI, pointed that global cerebral atrophy that is 
      incompatible with his age. Brain perfusion studies (SPECT, (99m)Tc-labeled HMPAO) 
      also showed that there were severe perfusion defects at superior temporal region and 
      less perfusion defects at gyrus cingulum in frontal region. These regions are 
      related with memory processing. Severe cognitive defect in this patient seems to be 
      closely related these changes and no another reason was found to explain except the 
      repeated severe hypoglycaemic episodes.

TI  - Early cardiac morphologic and functional changes in neurofibromatosis type 1 
      hypertensives: an echocardiographic and tissue Doppler study.
PG  - 243-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 
      (NF1), a common inherited disease that limits life expectancy. No data are available 
      on cardiac damage in NF1 patients with hypertension. We evaluated cardiac function 
      in NF1 patients with hypertension diagnosed by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure 
      monitoring (ABPM), compared with normal children. METHODS: We studied 73 NF1 
      patients (41 boys; mean age 12 years) and 30 normal children comparable for age and 
      sex, using standard 2D echocardiography, standard Doppler and Doppler tissue imaging 
      (DTI). Twelve patients (16%) showed 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 24-h 
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >95th percentile for age and sex. We divided the NF1 
      group into two subgroups: group A, patients with 24-h SBP and DBP </=95th percentile 
      for age and sex, and group B, patients with 24-h SBP or DBP >95th percentile for age 
      and sex. RESULTS: Group B presented a thicker end-diastolic interventricular septum 
      (p<0.0001), posterior wall (p=0.02), LVMI (p<0.001) and relative wall thickness 
      (p<0.03) than group A and controls. Left atrial dimension in group B was also 
      significantly larger. Examination by standard Doppler showed a deceleration and 
      isovolumic relaxation time significantly prolonged in group B. DTI parameters were 
      significantly higher in NF1 patients than controls. In group B, myocardial early 
      diastolic (E(m)) and systolic (S(m)) velocities were significantly lower than group 
      A. Myocardial early/late diastolic ratio (E(m)/A(m)) in NF1 patients was lower than 
      controls and 19% of group A and 20% of group B showed an E(m)/A(m) ratio <1. No 
      healthy subjects presented an E(m)/A(m) ratio <1. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated early 
      cardiac morphologic and functional changes in young NF1 patients with hypertension. 
      Because DTI directly studies cardiac muscle, it can detect changes induced by 
      hypertension as well as those independent of blood pressure.

PG  - 98
LID - 10.1186/1471-2350-13-98 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene at 
      17q11.2. In 95% of non-founder NF1 patients, NF1 mutations are identifiable by means 
      of a comprehensive mutation analysis. 5-10% of these patients harbour microdeletions 
      encompassing the NF1 gene and its flanking regions. NF1 is characterised by tumours 
      of the peripheral nerve sheaths, the pathognomonic neurofibromas. Considerable 
      inter- and intra-familial variation in expressivity of the disease has been observed 
      which is influenced by genetic modifiers unrelated to the constitutional NF1 
      mutation. The number of plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) in NF1 patients is a highly 
      heritable genetic trait. Recently, SNP rs2151280 located within the non-coding RNA 
      gene ANRIL at 9p21.3, was identified as being strongly associated with PNF number in 
      a family-based association study. The T-allele of rs2151280, which correlates with 
      reduced ANRIL expression, appears to be associated with higher PNF number. ANRIL 
      directly binds to the SUZ12 protein, an essential component of polycomb repressive 
      complex 2, and is required for SUZ12 occupancy of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B tumour 
      suppressor genes as well as for their epigenetic silencing. METHODS: Here, we 
      explored a potential association of PNF number and PNF volume with SNP rs2151280 in 
      29 patients with constitutional NF1 microdeletions using the exact Cochran-Armitage 
      test for trends and the exact Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Both the PNF number and 
      total tumour volume in these 29 NF1 patients were assessed by whole-body MRI. The 
      NF1 microdeletions observed in these 29 patients encompassed the NF1 gene as well as 
      its flanking regions, including the SUZ12 gene. RESULTS: In the 29 microdeletion 
      patients investigated, neither the PNF number nor PNF volume was found to be 
      associated with the T-allele of rs2151280. CONCLUSION: Our findings imply that, at 
      least in patients with NF1 microdeletions, PNF susceptibility is not associated with 
      rs2151280. Although somatic inactivation of the NF1 wild-type allele is considered 
      to be the PNF-initiating event in NF1 patients with intragenic mutations and 
      patients with NF1 microdeletions, both patient groups may differ with regard to 
      tumour progression because of the heterozygous constitutional deletion of SUZ12 
      present only in patients with NF1 microdeletions.

AB  - Functional and structural brain alterations have been noted in carpal tunnel 
      syndrome (CTS), the most common entrapment peripheral neuropathy. Previous studies 
      were mainly focused on somatosensory cortices. However, the changes of white matter 
      diffusion properties in nonsensorimotor cortices remain uninvestigated. We utilized 
      a modified tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) pipeline to explore CTS-related 
      white matter plasticity, omitting the skeletonization step and registering diffusion 
      tensor imaging (DTI) data to a study-specific, high resolution T1 template by an 
      optimized registration method. The modified TBSS was demonstrated to be more 
      sensitive to detect changes in white matter integrity than the standard TBSS 
      approach. In this study, 25 moderate/severe CTS patients and 17 age- and sex-matched 
      healthy controls (HC) were evaluated with DTI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial 
      diffusivity (RD) were calculated for group comparison. And the relationship between 
      diffusion parameters and clinical assessments was also analyzed. Comparing with the 
      healthy controls, CTS patients showed significantly increased FA and decreased RD in 
      areas of multisensory integration and motor control involving the central opercular 
      cortex and supplementary motor area (SMA) of the dominant hemisphere. Moreover, 
      altered diffusion parameters in the central opercular cortex of the dominant 
      hemisphere were significantly correlated with Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire 
      (BCTQ) scores. It is considered to be a form of maladaptive neuroplastic response to 
      CTS-associated afference and motor control deficits. Such insight may be helpful in 
      developing new strategies for the treatment of CTS.

TI  - Axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy concurrent with distal and proximal weakness 
      by translational elongation of the 3' UTR in NEFH.
PG  - 200-207
LID - 10.1111/jns.12223 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the NEFH gene encoding the heavy neurofilament protein are usually 
      associated with neuronal damage and susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS). Recently, frameshift variants in NEFH (p.Asp1004Glnfs*58 and 
      p.Pro1008Alafs*56) have been reported to be the underlying cause of axonal 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2CC (CMT2CC). The frameshift mutation resulted in a 
      stop loss and translation of a cryptic amyloidogenic element (CAE) encoded by the 3' 
      untranslated region (UTR). This study also identified a de novo c.3015_3027dup 
      frameshift mutation predicting p.Lys1010Glnfs*57 in NEFH from a CMT2 family with an 
      atypical clinical symptom of prominent proximal weakness. This mutation is located 
      near the previously reported frameshift mutations, suggesting a mutational hotspot. 
      Lower limb magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed marked hyperintense signal 
      changes in the thigh muscles compared with those in the calf muscles. Therefore, 
      this study suggests that the stop loss and translational elongations by the 3' UTR 
      of the NEFH mutations may be a relatively frequent genetic cause of axonal 
      peripheral neuropathy with the specific characteristics of proximal dominant 
      weakness.

TI  - Reduced Thalamic Volume and Metabolites in Type 1 Diabetes with Polyneuropathy.
LID - 10.1055/a-1347-2579 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Thalamus is essential in processing of sensory information. This study 
      explored the associations between thalamic volume and intra-thalamic metabolites and 
      associations to clinical and experimental characteristics of sensory function in 
      adults with diabetic polyneuropathy. METHODS: 48 adults with type 1 diabetes and 
      confirmed distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy (DPSN) and 28 healthy controls 
      participated in a cross-sectional study and underwent a brain magnetic resonance 
      imaging scan. Estimates for thalamic volume were extracted using voxel-based 
      morphometry and intra-thalamic N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/cre) levels were 
      assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Associations between thalamic volume 
      and clinical measures, quantitative sensory testing and neuropathic phenotype were 
      explored. RESULTS: In diabetes, reduced gray matter volume was identified including 
      bilateral thalamus (all p≤0.001) in comparison to healthy participants. Thalamic 
      volume estimates were positively associated to intra-thalamic NAA/cre (r=0.4; 
      p=0.006), however not to diabetes duration (p=0.5), severity of DSPN (p=0.7), or 
      presence of pain (p=0.3). Individuals with the lowest thalamic volume had greatest 
      loss of protective sensation (light touch using von Frey-like filaments, p=0.037) 
      and highest pain tolerance to electric stimulation (tetanic stimulation, p=0.008) 
      compared to individuals with the highest thalamic volume. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      cohort with type 1 diabetes and severe DSPN, thalamic atrophy was present and 
      associated with reduced NAA/cre, indicating thalamic structural loss and 
      dysfunction. Thalamic atrophy was associated to reduced sensory function involving 
      large fiber neuropathy and sensation to tetanic stimulation that may reflect 
      synaptic transmission. This may ultimately contribute to the current understanding 
      of the pathophysiology behind the perception changes evident in DSPN.

TI  - Machine-Learning Approach to Differentiation of Benign and Malignant Peripheral 
      Nerve Sheath Tumors: A Multicenter Study.
LID - nyab212 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/neuros/nyab212 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicoradiologic differentiation between benign and malignant 
      peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) has important management implications. 
      OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate machine-learning approaches to differentiate 
      benign from malignant PNSTs. METHODS: We identified PNSTs treated at 3 institutions 
      and extracted high-dimensional radiomics features from gadolinium-enhanced, 
      T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Training and test sets were 
      selected randomly in a 70:30 ratio. A total of 900 image features were automatically 
      extracted using the PyRadiomics package from Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline. 
      Clinical data including age, sex, neurogenetic syndrome presence, spontaneous pain, 
      and motor deficit were also incorporated. Features were selected using sparse 
      regression analysis and retained features were further refined by gradient boost 
      modeling to optimize the area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosis. We evaluated the 
      performance of radiomics-based classifiers with and without clinical features and 
      compared performance against human readers. RESULTS: A total of 95 malignant and 171 
      benign PNSTs were included. The final classifier model included 21 imaging and 
      clinical features. Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.676, 0.882, and 0.845, 
      respectively, were achieved on the test set. Using imaging and clinical features, 
      human experts collectively achieved sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.786, 
      0.431, and 0.624, respectively. The AUC of the classifier was statistically better 
      than expert humans (P = .002). Expert humans were not statistically better than the 
      no-information rate, whereas the classifier was (P = .001). CONCLUSION: 
      Radiomics-based machine learning using routine MRI sequences and clinical features 
      can aid in evaluation of PNSTs. Further improvement may be achieved by incorporating 
      additional imaging sequences and clinical variables into future models.

LID - 10.1097/RCT.0000000000001134 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a difference between healthy control group 
      and children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in terms of apparent diffusion 
      coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in different regions of the 
      brain associated with neurocognitive functions and to investigate the correlation 
      between diffusion tensor imaging parameters and neurocognitive dysfunctions. 
      METHODS: The study included 28 children with NF1 and 21 controls. Nine distinct 
      areas related to cognitive functions were selected for the analysis. The ADC and FA 
      values were compared. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between NF1 and 
      healthy control in terms of ADC values obtained from all areas. The ADC values at 
      obtained from thalamus and striatum were positively correlated with the full-scale 
      intelligence quotient (IQ), verbal IQ, and performance IQ. CONCLUSIONS: We are 
      speculated that the development of microstructural damage in the thalamostriatal 
      pathway may lead to neurocognitive dysfunction.

PG  - 461-6
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010347 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcomes and safety after CT-guided percutaneous 
      sacroplasty in patients with painful sacral insufficiency fractures or pathologic 
      sacral lesions. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter analysis of consecutive 
      patients undergoing CT-guided sacroplasty for painful sacral insufficiency fractures 
      or sacral lesions was undertaken. The inclusion criteria consisted of severe sacral 
      pain not responding to conservative medical management with imaging evidence of 
      unilateral or bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures or lesions. Outcome measures 
      included hospitalization status (inpatient or outpatient), pre-treatment and 
      post-treatment visual analog scale (VAS) scores, analgesic use and complications. 
      Patients were followed at approximately 1 month and for at least 1 year after their 
      sacroplasty procedure. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-three patients were included 
      in the study, 204 with painful sacral insufficiency fractures and 39 with 
      symptomatic sacral lesions. The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.2±1.1 was 
      significantly improved after sacroplasty to 1.9±1.7 in patients with sacral 
      insufficiency fractures (p<0.001). The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.0±0.9 in 
      patients with sacral lesions was significantly improved after sacroplasty to 2.6±2.4 
      (p<0.001). There were no major complications or procedure-related deaths. One 
      patient who was treated for a sacral insufficiency fracture experienced radicular 
      pain due to local extravasation of cement that subsequently required surgical 
      decompression for symptomatic relief. CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided percutaneous 
      sacroplasty is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of painful sacral 
      insufficiency fractures or lesions. It is associated with prompt and durable pain 
      relief and should be considered as an effective treatment option in this patient 
      population.

TI  - Structural remodeling in related brain regions in patients with facial synkinesis.
PG  - 2528-2533
LID - 10.4103/1673-5374.313055 [doi]
AB  - Facial synkinesis is a troublesome sequelae of facial nerve malfunction. It is 
      difficult to recover from synkinesis, despite improved surgical techniques for 
      isolating the peripheral facial nerve branches. Furthermore, it remains unclear 
      whether long-term dysfunction of motor control can lead to irreversible 
      plasticity-induced structural brain changes. This case-control study thus 
      investigated the structural brain alterations associated with facial synkinesis. The 
      study was conducted at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong 
      University School of Medicine, China. Twenty patients with facial synkinesis (2 male 
      and 18 female, aged 33.35 ± 6.97 years) and 19 healthy volunteers (2 male and 17 
      female, aged 33.21 ± 6.75 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and 
      voxel-based and surface-based morphometry techniques were used to analyze data. 
      There was no significant difference in brain volume between patients with facial 
      synkinesis and healthy volunteers. Patients with facial synkinesis exhibited a 
      significantly reduced cortical thickness in the contralateral superior and inferior 
      temporal gyri and a reduced sulcal depth of the ipsilateral precuneus compared with 
      healthy volunteers. In addition, sulcal depth of the ipsilateral precuneus was 
      negatively correlated with the severity of depression. These findings suggest that 
      there is a structural remodeling of gray matter in patients with facial synkinesis 
      after facial nerve malfunction. This study was approved by the Ethics Review 
      Committee of the Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of 
      Medicine, China (approval No. 2017-365-T267) on September 13, 2017, and was 
      registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: 
      ChiCTR1800014630) on January 25, 2018.

PG  - 459-64
AB  - This report details previously undescribed sonographic findings in the anterior 
      interosseous nerve syndrome. Loss of muscle bulk, increased reflectivity, reduced 
      perfusion on Doppler sonography, and lack of active contraction of the affected 
      muscles were observed. These findings can aid in the localization of the pathologic 
      process and in the exclusion of tendon rupture. Dynamic observation of muscle 
      function and Doppler changes after exercise can also help identify the muscles 
      involved. Both sonography and MRI may be useful in the evaluation of patients with 
      the anterior interosseous nerve syndrome and other peripheral neuropathies.

AB  - CONTEXT: Although diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is predominantly considered a 
      disorder of the peripheral nerves, some evidence for central nervous system 
      involvement has recently emerged. However, whether or to what extent the 
      microstructure of central somatosensory tracts may be injured remains unknown. 
      OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to detect the microstructure of central somatosensory 
      tracts in type 2 diabetic patients and to correlate it with the severity of DPN. 
      METHODS: A case-control study at a tertiary referral hospital took place with 57 
      individuals with type 2 diabetes (25 with DPN, 32 without DPN) and 33 nondiabetic 
      controls. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of 2 major somatosensory tracts (the 
      spinothalamic tract and its thalamocortical [spino-thalamo-cortical, STC] pathway, 
      the medial lemniscus and its thalamocortical [medial lemnisco-thalamo-cortical, 
      MLTC] pathway) were assessed based on diffusion tensor tractography. Regression 
      models were further applied to detect the association of FA values with the severity 
      of DPN in diabetic patients. RESULTS: The mean FA values of left STC and left MLTC 
      pathways were significantly lower in patients with DPN than those without DPN and 
      controls. Moreover, FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly 
      associated with the severity of DPN (expressed as Toronto Clinical Scoring System 
      values) in patients after adjusting for multiple confounders. CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings demonstrated the axonal degeneration of central somatosensory tracts in 
      type 2 diabetic patients with DPN. The parallel disease progression of the 
      intracranial and extracranial somatosensory system merits further attention to the 
      central nerves in diabetic patients with DPN.

AB  - Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of a case of Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD) using 
      a 1.5 T system is described. The patient showed progressive spastic diplegia with 
      equinovarus deformity of the feet, dystonic postural movements, dysarthria, 
      dysphagia, mental deterioration, optic nerve atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. 
      These clinical features were compatible with HSD. Symmetrical, decreased signal 
      intensity was seen on both proton density weighted and T2-weighted spin echo images 
      in the globus pallidus as well as in the substantia nigra (Group I). This MR finding 
      suggests an increased iron deposition in these subcortical nuclei, which is 
      characteristic of HSD. The characteristic MR imaging, together with the relevant 
      clinical features, was considered to be useful for establishing the diagnosis of 
      HSD.

AB  - A 7-year-old female presented with fever, urinary incontinence, mental regression,

      multifocal T(2)-weighted hypersignal lesions supportive of acute disseminated 
      encephalomyelitis. Her mother had been diagnosed with hereditary neuropathy with 
      susceptibility to pressure palsy. The girl was also determined to have hereditary 
      neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy, with a 1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 
      17p11.2 encompassing the gene for peripheral myelin protein 22 detected by 
      fluorescent in situ hybridization. Hereditary peripheral neuropathies may be a 
      factor in triggering the autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous 
      system.

TI  - A case of cerebellar ataxia associated with VZV infection.
PG  - 9-10
LID - 10.1016/j.ensci.2018.04.003 [doi]
AB  - The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic virus that becomes latent in the 
      sensory ganglia, but later causes various neurologic complications such as 
      meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, cranial neuropathy, and 
      peripheral neuropathy [1]. While acute cerebellitis is one of the most frequent 
      acute cerebellar diseases associated with VZV in childhood, VZV rarely causes 
      cerebellitis in adults, with or without skin manifestations, and only a few isolated 
      cases of adult VZV cerebellitis have been reported. We report a case of acute 
      cerebellitis associated with VZV infection after a herpetic rash in an 80-year-old 
      male. Functional imaging of his cerebellum showed high blood perfusion during the 
      acute stage of the disease, though perfusion decreased in the subacute stage.

TI  - Neurologic complications of HIV disease and their treatment.
PG  - 32-9
AB  - Important new information regarding neurologic complications of HIV disease was 
      presented at the 2007 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. In 
      addition to presentations on pathogenesis and treatment of neurologic complications, 
      the conference included findings that have implications for the management of HIV 
      disease outside the nervous system. Key findings included that the distribution of 
      antiretrovirals into the central nervous system may influence the effectiveness of 
      treatment outside this protected compartment; that postponing initiation of therapy 
      until blood CD4+ counts fall to 300 cells/mm3 may increase the risk for 
      HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment but interruption of antiretroviral therapy 
      in individuals with high CD4+ counts may have neuropsychologic benefits; that 
      substantial changes, including macrophage activation and neuronal injury can occur 
      shortly after HIV transmission; that HIV can influence neural progenitor cells to 
      decrease neuronal differentiation; that newer neuroimaging technologies, such as 
      diffusion tensor imaging and blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging can identify important effects of HIV on the brain such as 
      alterations in cerebral oxygen consumption; that serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors may reduce HIV 
      RNA levels in cerebral spinal fluid; and that erythropoietin and the 
      non-immunosuppressive immunophilin ligand, GPI-1046, may improve HIV-associated 
      injury of peripheral nerves. The conference also included an important focus on JC 
      virus encephalitis (also known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy).

TI  - Macrostructural brain changes in patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes mellitus 
      - a cortical thickness analysis study.
PG  - 354-60
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1345120 [doi]
AB  - Longstanding diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the risk of complications 
      affecting the central nervous system. The aims were to study brain volume and 
      cortical thickness in regional brain areas in DM patients and to correlate the 
      findings with relevant clinical data.15 patients with longstanding (average 24.6 
      years) type 1 DM and 20 healthy controls were studied in a 3T magnetic resonance 
      scanner. Using an automated surface based cortical segmentation method, cortical 
      thickness was assessed in anatomical regions including total and lobe-wise grey and 
      white matter volumes. Also morphological changes were evaluated.No differences 
      between patients and controls were found in regard to number of white matter lesions 
      (P=0.50), grey and white matter volumes (P=0.25) and overall cortical thickness 
      (P=0.64). Subanalysis revealed exclusively reduced cortical thickness of the 
      postcentral (P=0.03) and superior parietal gyrus (P=0.008) in patients. The cortical 
      thickness of these regions was not associated with diabetes duration, age at 
      diabetes onset or to HbA1c (all P>0.08). Patients with peripheral neuropathy showed 
      reduced right postcentral gyrus cortical thickness compared to patients without 
      peripheral neuropathy (P=0.02).Patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed 
      cortical thinning involving sensory related areas, even though no overall 
      macrostructural brain alterations were detected. This could possibly have underlying 
      functional significance since cortical thinning was associated to presence of 
      peripheral neuropathy. The absence of universal macrostructural changes might 
      illustrate that more pronounced brain pathology is likely to be preceded by more 
      subtle microstructural changes as reported in other studies.

LID - 780964
AB  - MR microneurography is a noninvasive technique that provides visualization of the 
      microanatomy of peripheral nerves, otherwise available only with histopathology. The 
      objective of this study was to present a protocol to visualize the microstructure of 
      peripheral nerves in vivo, using a 3T MRI scanner with a clinical set of coils and 
      sequences. The tibial and the common peroneal nerves of healthy volunteers were 
      imaged above the medial malleolus and at the level of the fibular head, 
      respectively. The acquired images provided details about the internal structure of 
      peripheral nerves, with visualization of the fascicles, the interfascicular fat, the 
      epineurium, and the perineurium. MR microneurography can be performed in a clinical 
      setting with acceptable imaging times and can be a potentially powerful tool that 
      complements standard MR neurography.

TI  - Determinants of Inter-Individual Variability in Corticomotor Excitability Induced by 
      Paired Associative Stimulation.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established tool in probing 
      cortical plasticity in vivo. Changes in corticomotor excitability can be induced 
      using paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which TMS over the primary 
      motor cortex is conditioned with an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the 
      contralateral hand. PAS with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms induces long-term 
      potentiation (LTP)-like effects in cortical excitability. However, the response to a 
      PAS protocol tends to vary substantially across individuals. In this study, we used 
      univariate and multivariate data-driven methods to investigate various previously 
      proposed determinants of inter-individual variability in PAS efficacy, such as 
      demographic, cognitive, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging measures. 
      Forty-one right-handed participants, comprising 22 patients with amnestic mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI) and 19 healthy controls (HC), underwent the PAS protocol. 
      Prior to stimulation, demographic, genetic, clinical, as well as structural and 
      resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The two groups did not differ in 
      any of the variables, except by global cognitive status. Univariate analysis showed 
      that only 61% of all participants were classified as PAS responders, irrespective of 
      group membership. Higher PAS response was associated with lower TMS intensity and 
      with higher resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, but only in 
      responders, as opposed to non-responders. We also found an overall positive 
      correlation between PAS response and structural connectivity within the 
      corticospinal tract, which did not differ between groups. A multivariate random 
      forest (RF) model identified age, gender, education, IQ, global cognitive status, 
      sleep quality, alertness, TMS intensity, genetic factors, and neuroimaging measures 
      (functional and structural connectivity, gray matter (GM) volume, and cortical 
      thickness as poor predictors of PAS response. The model resulted in low accuracy of 
      the RF classifier (58%; 95% CI: 42 - 74%), with a higher relative importance of 
      brain connectivity measures compared to the other variables. We conclude that PAS 
      variability in our sample was not well explained by factors known to influence PAS 
      efficacy, emphasizing the need for future replication studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the lack of understanding of the fascicular organisation, vagus 
      nerve stimulation (VNS) leads to unwanted off-target effects. Micro-computed 
      tomography (microCT) can be used to trace fascicles from periphery and image 
      fascicular anatomy. NEW METHOD: In this study, we present a simple and reproducible 
      method for imaging fascicles in peripheral nerves with iodine staining and microCT 
      for the determination of fascicular anatomy and organisation. RESULTS: At the 
      determined optimal pre-processing steps and scanning parameters, the microCT 
      protocol allowed for segmentation and tracking of fascicles within the nerves. This 
      was achieved after 24 hours and 120 hours of staining with Lugol's solution (1% 
      total iodine) for rat sciatic and pig vagus nerves, respectively, and the following 
      scanning parameters: 4 μm voxel size, 35 kVp energy, 114 μA current, 4 W power, 0.25 
      fps in 4 s exposure time, 3176 projections and a molybdenum target. COMPARISON WITH 
      EXISTING METHOD(S): This optimised method for imaging fascicles provides 
      high-resolution, three-dimensional images and full imaging penetration depth not 
      obtainable with methods typically used such as histology, magnetic resonance imaging 
      and optical coherence tomography whilst obviating time-consuming pre-processing 
      methods, the amount of memory required, destruction of the samples and the cost 
      associated with current microCT methods. CONCLUSION: The optimised microCT protocol 
      facilitates segmentation and tracking of the fascicles within the nerve. The 
      resulting segmentation map of the functional anatomical organisation of the vagus 
      nerve will enable selective VNS ultimately allowing for the avoidance of the 
      off-target effects and improving its therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) refers to exercise-induced, 
      reversible increases in pressure within well-defined inelastic fascial compartments 
      leading to compromised tissue perfusion followed by functional loss, ischemic pain, 
      and neurologic symptoms. Symptoms typically resolve when the activity ceases and 
      there are usually no permanent sequelae. In the upper extremity, this condition most 
      commonly affects athletes during sports requiring repetitive and vigorous gripping, 
      such as rowers. In addition to clinical history and examination, a number of methods 
      aid diagnosis, including compartment pressure measurements, magnetic resonance 
      imaging, and near infrared spectroscopy. When symptoms persist despite conservative 
      treatment, multiple operative techniques have been described to treat CECS including 
      open, mini-open, and endoscopic release of involved compartments. We review the 
      pathophysiology, diagnostic modalities, treatment strategies, and outcomes data for 
      CECS of the upper extremity while highlighting areas of residual controversy.

TI  - Clinical, radiological, neurophysiological, and neuropathological characteristics of 
      gluten ataxia.
PG  - 1582-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ataxia is the commonest neurological manifestation of coeliac disease. 
      Some individuals with genetic susceptibility to the disease have serological 
      evidence of gluten sensitivity without overt gastrointestinal symptoms or evidence 
      of small-bowel inflammation. The sole manifestation of disease in such patients may 
      be ataxia. We describe the clinical, radiological, and neurophysiological features 
      of this disorder. METHODS: Patients with ataxia attending the neurology outpatient 
      clinics at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK, were screened for gluten 
      sensitivity as shown by the titre of antibody to gliadin. Those with other causes of 
      ataxia were excluded. We carried out clinical, neurophysiological, 
      neuroradiological, and, in two cases, neuropathological examinations. FINDINGS: 28 
      patients with gluten ataxia were identified. All had gait ataxia and most had limb 
      ataxia. Those with more severe gait ataxia had longer disease duration. No patient 
      had tremor or other extrapyramidal features. 19 patients showed some form of 
      peripheral neuropathy on neurophysiological examination. 16 patients had no 
      gastrointestinal symptoms. Distal duodenal biopsy showed lymphocytic infiltration in 
      two patients, and changes compatible with coeliac disease in 11. Six patients had 
      evidence of cerebellar atrophy on magnetic-resonance imaging. Necropsy was done on 
      two patients who died; there was lymphocytic infiltration of the cerebellum, damage 
      to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and sparse infiltration of the 
      peripheral nerves. INTERPRETATION: Gluten sensitivity is an important cause of 
      apparently idiopathic ataxia and may be progressive. The ataxia is a result of 
      immunological damage to the cerebellum, to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, 
      and to peripheral nerves. We propose the term gluten ataxia to describe this 
      disorder.
