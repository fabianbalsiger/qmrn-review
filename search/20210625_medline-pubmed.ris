N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the diagnostic performance of qualitative and  (semi-)quantitative MRI and ultrasound for distinguishing chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) from segmental spinal muscular atrophy (sSMA). METHODS: Patients with CIDP (n = 13), MMN (n = 10), or sSMA (n = 12) and healthy volunteers (n = 30) were included. MRI of the brachial plexus, using short tau inversion recovery (STIR), nerve-specific T2-weighted (magnetic resonance neurography [MRN]), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences, was evaluated. Furthermore, with ultrasound, cross-sectional areas of the nerves were evaluated. Three radiologists blinded for diagnosis qualitatively scored hypertrophy and increased signal intensity (STIR and MRN), and intraobserver and interobserver agreement was assessed. For the (semi-)quantitative modalities, group differences and receiver operator characteristics were calculated. RESULTS: Hypertrophy and increased signal intensity were found in all groups including healthy controls. Intraobserver and interobserver agreements varied considerably (intraclass correlation coefficients 0.00-0.811 and 0.101-0.491, respectively). DTI showed significant differences (p < 0.05) among CIDP, MMN, sSMA, and controls for fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in the brachial plexus. Ultrasound showed significant differences in cross-sectional area (p < 0.05) among CIDP, MMN, and sSMA in upper arm and brachial plexus. For distinguishing immune-mediated neuropathies (CIDP and MMN) from sSMA, ultrasound yielded the highest area under the curve (0.870). CONCLUSION: Qualitative assessment of hypertrophy and signal hyperintensity on STIR or MRN is of limited value. DTI measures may discriminate among CIDP, MMN, and sSMA. Currently, ultrasound may be the most appropriate diagnostic imaging aid in the clinical setting.

N2  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) also known as Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is a  hereditary neurodegenerative disease associated with severe clinical manifestations and premature death. Although rare, it is the most common autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide and has a distinct geographic distribution, reaching peak prevalence in certain regions of Brazil, Portugal and China. Due to its clinical heterogeneity, it was initially described as several different entities and as had many designations over the last decades. An accurate diagnosis become possible in 1994, after the identification of the MJD1 gene. Among its wide clinical spectrum, progressive cerebellar ataxia is normally present. Other symptoms include pyramidal syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, oculomotor abnormalities, extrapyramidal signs and sleep disorders. On the basis of the presence/absence of important extra-pyramidal signs, and the presence/absence of peripheral signs, five clinical types have been defined. Neuroimaging studies like MRI, DTI and MRS, can be useful as they can characterize structural and functional differences in specific subgroups of patients with MJD. There is no effective treatment for MJD. Symptomatic therapies are used to relieve some of the clinical symptoms and physiotherapy is also helpful in improving quality of live. Several clinical trials have been carried out using different molecules like sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, varenicline and lithium carbonate, but the results of these trials were negative or showed little benefit. Future studies sufficiently powered and adequately designed are warranted.

N2  - Magnetic resonance neurography (also called MRN or MR neurography) refers to MR  imaging dedicated to the peripheral nerves. It is a technique that enhances selective multiplanar visualisation of the peripheral nerve and pathology by encompassing a combination of two-dimensional, three-dimensional and diffusion imaging pulse sequences. Referring physicians who seek imaging techniques that can depict and diagnose peripheral nerve pathologies superior to conventional MR imaging are driving the demand for MRN. This article reviews the pathophysiology of peripheral nerves in common practice scenarios, technical considerations of MRN, current indications of MRN, normal and abnormal neuromuscular appearances, and imaging pitfalls. Finally, the emerging utility of diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging is discussed and future directions are highlighted. KEY POINTS: • Lesion relationship to neural architecture is more conspicuous on MRN than MRI. • 3D multiplanar imaging technique is essential for pre-surgical planning. • Nerve injuries can be classified on MRN using Sunderland's classification. • DTI provides quantitative information and insight into intraneural integrity and pathophysiology.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Single-organ vasculitis of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is  often designated nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN). Several variants or subtypes have been distinguished, including migratory sensory neuropathy, postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy, diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies, skin-nerve vasculitides, and, arguably, neuralgic amyotrophy. NSVN often presents as nondiabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (LRPN). This review updates classification, clinical features, epidemiology, and imaging of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: A recent study showed the annual incidence of LRPN in Olmstead County, Minnesota to be 4.16/100 000:2.79/100 000 diabetic and 1.27/100 000 nondiabetic. This study was the first to determine the incidence or prevalence of any vasculitic neuropathy. In NSVN, ultrasonography shows multifocal enlargement of proximal and distal nerves. In neuralgic amyotrophy, MRI and ultrasound reveal multifocal enlargements and focal constrictions in nerves derived from the brachial plexus. Histopathology of these chronic lesions shows inflammation and rare vasculitis. Diffusion tensor imaging of tibial nerves in NSVN revealed decreased fractional anisotropy in one study. SUMMARY: Single-organ PNS vasculitides are the most common inflammatory neuropathies. Neuralgic amyotrophy might result from PNS vasculitis, but further study is necessary. The usefulness of focal nerve enlargements or constrictions in understanding pathological mechanisms, directing biopsies, and monitoring disease activity in NSVN should be further investigated.

N2  - Background Neurologic complications in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been  described, but the understanding of their pathophysiologic causes and neuroanatomical correlates remains limited. Purpose To report on the frequency and type of neuroradiological findings in COVID-19. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, all consecutive adult hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who underwent neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May 24, 2020, were included. All examinations were systematically re-evaluated by 12 readers. Summary descriptive statistics were calculated. Results A total of 185 patients with COVID-19 (62 years ± 14 [standard deviation]; 138 men) underwent neuroimaging. In total, 222 brain CT, 47 brain MRI, and seven spinal MRI examinations were performed. Intra-axial susceptibility abnormalities were the most common finding (29 of 39; 74%, 95% CI: 58, 87) in patients who underwent brain MRI, often with an ovoid shape suggestive of microvascular pathology and with a predilection for the corpus callosum (23 of 39; 59%; 95% CI: 42, 74) and juxtacortical areas (14 of 39; 36%; 95% CI: 21, 53). Ischemic and macrohemorrhagic manifestations were also observed, but vascular imaging did not demonstrate overt abnormalities. Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 19 patients did not reveal consistent asymmetries between hemispheres or regions. Many patients (18 of 41; 44%; 95% CI: 28, 60) had leukoencephalopathy and one patient had a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum. Other findings included olfactory bulb signal abnormalities (seven of 37; 19%), prominent optic nerve subarachnoid spaces (20 of 36; 56%), and enhancement of the parenchyma (three of 20; 15%), leptomeninges (three of 20; 15%), cranial nerves (two of 20; 10%), and spinal nerves (two of four; 50%). At MRI follow-up, regression of leukoencephalopathy and progressive leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in one patient each, respectively, which is suggestive of dynamic processes. Conclusion Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 had a wide spectrum of vascular and inflammatory involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

N2  - Nerve imaging is an important component in the assessment of patients presenting  with suspected peripheral nerve pathology. Although magnetic resonance neurography and ultrasound are the most commonly utilized techniques, several promising new modalities are on the horizon. Nerve imaging is useful in localizing the nerve injury, determining the severity, providing prognostic information, helping establish the diagnosis, and helping guide surgical decision making. The focus of this article is imaging of damaged nerves, focusing on nerve injuries and entrapment neuropathies.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN: We examined the chronic inflammatory demyelinating  polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) patients and non-CIDP patients who have similar symptoms and difficult to differential diagnosis with CIDP by magnetic resonance neurography to find the difference among them. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differential diagnostic value of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) for CIDP and other peripheral neuropathies. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Thirty-two consecutive patients with CIDP and 22 non-CIDP patients with symptoms similar to CIDP and difficult to be discriminate were recruited and imaged as a control group between May 2017 and May 2019. METHODS: In this prospective study, the brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus of 32 CIDP patients and 22 non-CIDP patients were examined by MRN. The clinical features and the nerve roots cross-sectional area (CSA) of the brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus were measured. RESULTS: The CSA of nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1 and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes syndrome patients were all shown extensive by MRN. The sensitivity of MRN in diagnosing CIDP was 81.25% (26/32), the specificity was 68.18% (15/22), the positive predictive value was 78.79% (26/33), the negative predictive value was 71.43% (15/21), the accuracy was 75.93% (40/54), the misdiagnosis rate was 24.07% (13/54), and the kappa value was 0.498. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for CIDP with the CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.762) and that of the brachial plexus (AUC = 0.762), and the combined of both examinations did not improve the diagnostic efficacy compared with either (AUC = 0.769). CONCLUSIONS: The nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1, and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes syndrome were difficult to distinguish by MRN. Atypical CIDP patients had less nerve root injury compared with typical CIDP patients. MRN of either the brachial plexus or the lumbosacral plexus had a high diagnostic accuracy for CIDP, and it is not necessary to perform both parts of the examination. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.

N2  - Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and related techniques such as  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are uniquely sensitive to the microstructure of the brain and spinal cord. In the acute aftermath of nervous system injury, for example, DWI reveals changes caused by injury that remains invisible on other MRI contrasts such as T(2)-weighted imaging. This ability has led to a demonstrated clinical utility in cerebral ischemia. However, despite strong promise in preclinical models and research settings, DWI has not been as readily adopted for other acute injuries such as traumatic spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the precise biophysical mechanisms that underlie DWI and DTI changes are not fully understood. In this report, we review the DWI and DTI changes that occur in acute neurological injury of cerebral ischemia, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and peripheral nerve injury. Their associations with the underlying biology are examined with an emphasis on the role of acute axon and dendrite beading. Lastly, emerging DWI techniques to overcome the limitations of DTI are discussed as these may offer the needed improvements to translate to clinical settings.

N2  - Technical advances are rapidly changing the clinical and instrumental approach to  peripheral nerve diseases. Magnetic resonance neurography, diffusion tensor imaging and nerve ultrasonography are increasingly entering the diagnostic workup of peripheral neuropathies as tools that complement neurophysiology and enable investigation of proximal structures, such as plexuses and roots. Progress in the design of magnetic resonance scanners and sequences, and the development of high-frequency ultrasound probes mean that high-resolution peripheral nerve imaging is possible, enabling detailed examination of nerve size, morphology and internal fascicular structure that can integrate nerve conduction studies into clinical practice. In the growing field of small-fibre neuropathy, in which traditional nerve conduction studies are of little or no use, skin biopsy has become a reliable tool for diagnosis. Corneal confocal microscopy, nociceptive evoked potentials and microneurography are emerging techniques that are mainly used in clinical research settings, but have increasing relevance to clinical practice. We review these new and emerging techniques and their effects on diagnosis, treatment strategies and prognosis in a variety of peripheral neuropathies, including entrapments, brachial plexopathies, immune and inherited neuropathies, and small-fibre neuropathies. We discuss the most promising research findings and their potential for future application in clinical practice.

N2  - We systematically identified and reviewed 29 studies of peripheral nerve ultrasound  or magnetic resonance imaging (MRN) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The majority of the ultrasound studies reported smaller nerves and nerve roots in ALS compared to healthy controls, but there was a large overlap of the cross-sectional nerve area between ALS and controls. Most of the MRN studies confirmed nerve abnormalities demonstrating slight T2 hyperintensities and, sometimes, mild enlargement of more proximal nerve segments (plexus, roots) in ALS. The size of the proximal nerve segments, i.e. nerve roots, is thus somewhat incongruent between nerve ultrasound and MRN in ALS. Peripheral nerve ultrasound has the potential to differentiate between ALS and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) in that patients with MMN have significantly larger nerves. Conversely, there is an overlap of MRN abnormalities in ALS and MMN, restricting the techniques' utility in the clinical setting. A subgroup of patients with ALS seems to reveal a sonographic nerve pattern suggesting peripheral nerve inflammation. In the future, combined imaging with nerve ultrasound and MRN assessing parameters such as blood flow or textural markers may aid in the understanding of the deep nerve microstructure down to the fascicle level, and thus, in the classification of the nerve state as more degenerative or more inflammatory in ALS. This systematic review provides evidence that nerve imaging abnormalities are common in ALS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative diffusion MRI is a promising technique for evaluating  peripheral nerve integrity but low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede measurement accuracy. PURPOSE: To evaluate principal component analysis (PCA) and generalized spherical deconvolution (genSD) denoising techniques to improve within-subject reproducibility and peripheral nerve conspicuity. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. SUBJECTS: Seven healthy volunteers and three peripheral neuropathy patients. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T/multiband single-shot echo planar diffusion sequence using multishell 55-direction scheme. ASSESSMENT: Images were processed using four methods: "original" (no denoising), "average" (10 repetitions), "PCA-only," and "PCA + genSD." Tibial and common peroneal nerve segmentations and masks were generated from volunteer diffusion data. Quantitative (SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) values were calculated. Three radiologists qualitatively evaluated nerve conspicuity for each method. The two denoising methods were also performed in three patients with peripheral neuropathies. STATISTICAL TESTS: For healthy volunteers, calculations included SNR and CNR(FA) (computed using FA values). Coefficient of variation (CV%) of CNR(FA) quantified within-subject reproducibility. Groups were compared with two-sample t-tests (significance P < 0.05; two-tailed, Bonferroni-corrected). Odds ratios (ORs) quantified the relative rates of each of three radiologists confidently identifying a nerve, per slice, for the four methods. RESULTS: "PCA + genSD" yielded the highest SNR (mean(overall) = 14.83 ± 1.99) and tibial and common peroneal nerve CNR(FA) (mean(tibial) = 3.45, mean(peroneal) = 2.34) compared to "original" (P (SNR) < 0.001; P (CNR) = 0.011) and "PCA-only" (P (SNR) < 0.001, P (CNR) < 0.001). "PCA + genSD" had higher within-subject reproducibility (low CV%) for tibial (6.04 ± 1.98) and common peroneal nerves (8.27 ± 2.75) compared to "original" and "PCA-only." The mean FA was higher for "original" than "average" (P < 0.001), but did not differ significantly between "average" and "PCA + genSD" (P = 0.14). "PCA + genSD" had higher tibial and common peroneal nerve conspicuity than "PCA-only" (OR(tibial) = 2.50, P < 0.001; OR(peroneal) = 1.86, P < 0.001) and "original" (OR(tibial) = 2.73, P < 0.001; OR(peroneal) = 2.43, P < 0.001). DATA CONCLUSION: PCA + genSD denoising method improved SNR, CNR(FA) , and within-subject reproducibility (CV%) without biasing FA and nerve conspicuity. This technique holds promise for facilitating more reliable, unbiased diffusion measurements of peripheral nerves. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical Efficacy Stage: 1 J. Magn. Reson.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Piriformis muscle syndrome (PS) is a disorder encompassing a  constellation of symptoms, including buttock and hip pain. In this study we aimed to assess the value of ultrasound (US) in the diagnosis of PS. METHODS: Thirty-three clinically diagnosed PS patients and 26 healthy volunteers underwent a clinical PS scoring examination and US and MRI assessment of the bilateral piriformis muscles. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of the US parameters (i.e., increased thickness [iTh] and increased cross-sectional area [iCSA]) for piriformis muscle were evaluated. RESULTS: On US and MRI, the thickness and CSA were increased in PS patients. The AUROCs for the iTh and iCSA for discriminating stage 0 (healthy volunteers) from stage 1 through stage 3 (PS patients) were 0.88 and 0.95, respectively. DISCUSSION: US may be a reliable technique for the clinical diagnosis of PS. Muscle Nerve 59:411-416, 2019.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize and quantify peripheral nerve lesions and muscle  degeneration in clinically, genetically, and electrophysiologically well-classified, nonpediatric patients with 5q-linked spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). METHODS: Thirty-one adult patients with genetically confirmed 5q-linked SMA types II, IIIa, and IIIb and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were prospectively investigated. All patients received neurologic, physiotherapeutic, and electrophysiologic assessments. MRN at 3.0T with anatomic coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to the tibiotalar joint was performed with dual-echo 2D relaxometry sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3D T2-weighted inversion recovery sequence. Detailed quantification of nerve injury by morphometric and microstructural MRN markers and qualitative classification of fatty muscle degeneration were conducted. RESULTS: Established clinical scores and compound muscle action potentials discriminated well between the 3 SMA types. MRN revealed that peroneal and tibial nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) at the thigh and lower leg level as well as spinal nerve CSA were markedly decreased throughout all 3 groups, indicating severe generalized peripheral nerve atrophy. While peroneal and tibial nerve T2 relaxation time was distinctly increased at all analyzed anatomic regions, the proton spin density was clearly decreased. Marked differences in fatty muscle degeneration were found between the 3 groups and for all analyzed compartments. CONCLUSIONS: MRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve involvement in SMA types II, IIIa, and IIIb with high sensitivity in vivo. Quantitative MRN parameters (T2 relaxation time(,) proton spin density, CSA) might serve as novel imaging biomarkers in SMA to indicate early microstructural nerve tissue changes in response to treatment.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Determine the rater agreement of MRI features of the ulnar nerve pre- and  post-transposition and association with recurrent symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This IRB-approved retrospective cohort analysis examined 23 subjects who underwent elbow MRI pre- and post-ulnar nerve transposition from 1999 to 2018, 10 of whom developed recurrent symptoms. Pre- and post-transposition MRIs were evaluated by two blinded radiologists for ulnar nerve cross-sectional area, signal intensity, fascicular architecture, caliber change, and perineural scar. Inter-rater agreement was estimated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for continuous variables and Gwet's agreement coefficient (AC) for categorical variables. Binary logistic regression modeling probed associations between imaging markers and symptom recurrence. RESULTS: The ulnar nerve, post-operatively, demonstrated statistically significant increases in size (p < 0.001), signal intensity (p = 0.021), and abrupt caliber change (p = 0.024). None of the imaging features, except for higher signal intensity of the nerve pre-transposition as demonstrated by one rater, were predictive of symptom recurrence. Inter-rater agreement for cross-sectional area measurements of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel was excellent (ICCs of 0.91 and 0.83). Substantial-to-excellent inter-rater agreement was observed pre-operatively for nerve signal intensity, caliber change, and fascicular architecture. Post-operatively, agreement on nerve signal intensity and perineural scar was excellent (ACs of 0.90 and 0.88), but only slight for caliber change (0.15). CONCLUSION: Inter-rater agreement for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the ulnar nerve was generally robust. Post-transposition, the ulnar nerve was generally larger and more T2-hyperintense, but MRI features were not predictive of recurrent ulnar neuropathy, except for perhaps the signal intensity of the nerve pre-transposition.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the discriminative power of radiomics of peripheral nerves at  1.5T MRI, using common entrapment neuropathies of the upper limb as a model system of focal nerve injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiomics was retrospectively done on peripheral nerve fascicles on T1-weighted 1.5T MRI of 40 patients with diagnosis of mild carpal (n = 25) and cubital tunnel (n = 15) syndrome and of 200 controls. Z-score normalization and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare features of normal and pathological peripheral nerves. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of n = 104 radiomics features were computed for each patient and control. Significant differences between normal and pathological median and ulnar nerves were found in n = 23/104 features (p < 0.001). According to features classification, n = 5/23 features were shape-based, n = 7/23 were first-order features, n = 11/23 features were classified as gray level run length matrix. Nine of the selected features showed an AUC higher that 0.7: minimum AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.61-0.89) for sum variance and maximum AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-0.99) for zone entropy. CONCLUSION: Features analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences between normal and pathological nerve. The results suggested that radiomics analysis could assess the median and ulnar nerve inner structure changes due to the loss of the fascicular pattern, intraneural edema, fibrosis or fascicular alterations in mild carpal tunnel and mild cubital tunnel syndromes even when the nerve cross-sectional area does not change.

N2  - AIMS: This study aimed to examine the correlation between DTI, clinical assessment,  and electromyography results in patients who underwent primary median nerve repair. METHODS: Ten patients who underwent primary repair of the complete median nerve transection were included. Study assessments were performed on both the traumatized and non-traumatized extremities and patients were followed up for a minimum duration of 11 months. Clinical assessments, (Tinnel test, static 2-point discrimination test, motor and quality of life assessments), electromyography and DTI were performed. RESULTS: None of the clinical or electromyographic parameters correlated significantly with any of the diffusion tensor imaging parameters, i.e. fractional anisotropy (FA) or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (p>0.05 for all). In addition, The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scores did not correlate with either FA (r=0.55, p=0.098) or ADC (r=0.40, p=0.260) values. However, Tinnel positive cases (n=3) had lower relative FA when compared to Tinnel negative cases (n=7) (-0.11±0.19 vs. 0.05±0.04, p=0.033). CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support the presence of relations between DTI parameters and electromyographic or most of the clinical parameters. Further MRI studies with larger numbers of patients with complete transection of the median nerve using the novel imaging parameters are warranted.

N2  - Background Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a disease of interstitial myocardial  infiltration, usually by light chains or transthyretin. We used diffusion tensor cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) to noninvasively assess the effects of amyloid infiltration on the cardiac microstructure. Methods DT-CMR was performed at diastole and systole in 20 CA, 11 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 10 control subjects with calculation of mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and sheetlet orientation (secondary eigenvector angle). Results Mean diffusivity was elevated and fractional anisotropy reduced in CA compared with both controls and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (P<0.001). In CA, mean diffusivity was correlated with extracellular volume (r=0.68, P=0.004), and fractional anisotropy was inversely correlated with circumferential strain (r=-0.65, P=0.02). In CA, diastolic secondary eigenvector angle was elevated, and secondary eigenvector angle mobility was reduced compared with controls (both P<0.001). Diastolic secondary eigenvector angle was correlated with amyloid burden measured by extracellular volume in transthyretin, but not light chain amyloidosis. Conclusions DT-CMR can characterize the microstructural effects of amyloid infiltration and is a contrast-free method to identify the location and extent of the expanded disorganized myocardium. The diffusion biomarkers mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy effectively discriminate CA from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. DT-CMR demonstrated that failure of sheetlet relaxation in diastole correlated with extracellular volume in transthyretin, but not light chain amyloidosis. This indicates that different mechanisms may be responsible for impaired contractility in CA, with an amyloid burden effect in transthyretin, but an idiosyncratic effect in light chain amyloidosis. Consequently, DT-CMR offers a contrast-free tool to identify novel pathophysiology, improve diagnostics, and monitor disease through noninvasive microstructural assessment.

N2  - The peripheral nervous system is increasingly being investigated using medical  imaging as a complement or in association with electrodiagnostics tests. The application of imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allows detailed visualization of the peripheral nervous system. According to the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, the use of US for nerve evaluation is strongly encouraged. In addition, the role of US is further enhanced by the wide application of US-guided techniques to diagnose or to treat peripheral nerve disorders.Standard evaluation of peripheral nerves on US usually relies on cross-sectional area evaluation with different cutoff values in the osteofibrous tunnels and outside them. In several anatomical areas, side-to-side comparison is highly recommended because it helps distinguish subtle variations by using the unaffected limb as an internal control.US is widely used to perform US-guided interventional procedures on peripheral nerves. The recent development of radiomics and machine and deep learning applied to peripheral nerves may reveal new insights beyond the capabilities of the human eye. Radiomics may have a role in expanding the diagnostic capabilities of US and MRI in the study of peripheral nerve pathology, especially when the cross-sectional area is not markedly increased.

N2  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder mostly  affecting the aging population over sixty. Cardinal symptoms including, tremors, muscle rigidity, drooping posture, drooling, walking difficulty, and autonomic symptoms appear when a significant number of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are already destroyed. Hence we need early, sensitive, specific, and economical peripheral and/or central biomarker(s) for the differential diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of PD. These can be classified as clinical, biochemical, genetic, proteomic, and neuroimaging biomarkers. Novel discoveries of genetic as well as nongenetic biomarkers may be utilized for the personalized treatment of PD during preclinical (premotor) and clinical (motor) stages. Premotor biomarkers including hyper-echogenicity of substantia nigra, olfactory and autonomic dysfunction, depression, hyposmia, deafness, REM sleep disorder, and impulsive behavior may be noticed during preclinical stage. Neuroimaging biomarkers (PET, SPECT, MRI), and neuropsychological deficits can facilitate differential diagnosis. Single-cell profiling of dopaminergic neurons has identified pyridoxal kinase and lysosomal ATPase as biomarker genes for PD prognosis. Promising biomarkers include: fluid biomarkers, neuromelanin antibodies, pathological forms of α-Syn, DJ-1, amyloid β and tau in the CSF, patterns of gene expression, metabolomics, urate, as well as protein profiling in the blood and CSF samples. Reduced brain regional N-acetyl-aspartate is a biomarker for the in vivo assessment of neuronal loss using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and T2 relaxation time with MRI. To confirm PD diagnosis, the PET biomarkers include [(18)F]-DOPA for estimating dopaminergic neurotransmission, [(18)F]dG for mitochondrial bioenergetics, [(18)F]BMS for mitochondrial complex-1, [(11)C](R)-PK11195 for microglial activation, SPECT imaging with (123)Iflupane and βCIT for dopamine transporter, and urinary salsolinol and 8-hydroxy, 2-deoxyguanosine for neuronal loss. This brief review describes the merits and limitations of recently discovered biomarkers and proposes coenzyme Q10, mitochondrial ubiquinone-NADH oxidoreductase, melatonin, α-synculein index, Charnoly body, and metallothioneins as novel biomarkers to confirm PD diagnosis for early and effective treatment of PD.

N2  - PURPOSE: Hinman syndrome is a rare disease with urodynamic findings and a clinical  course resembling neuropathic bladder, without a neuropathic etiology. Diffusion tensor imaging is a special technique of magnetic resonance imaging that has recently been used to evaluate the peripheral nerves but has been demonstrated to be applicable for evaluation of the lumbosacral plexus. We examined the lumbosacral plexus using diffusion tensor imaging, which has not previously been reported in patients with Hinman syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 12 patients who fulfilled criteria for Hinman syndrome, with severe bladder dysfunction on urodynamics, renal scarring on scintigraphy and no pathological findings on magnetic resonance imaging. The 12 subjects serving as controls required pelvic or spinal magnetic resonance imaging for reasons other than spinal abnormalities. Evaluation was performed with a 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system and 16-channel body coil. Tractography was done to examine the lumbosacral plexus. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were computed and compared between groups for the right and left plexuses. RESULTS: Mean fractional anisotropy was 0.24 and 0.35 for the right plexus in patients and controls, respectively, and 0.24 and 0.36 for the left plexus. Mean diffusivity was 1.39 for the right and left plexuses in patients, and 1.28 for the right and left plexuses in controls (p <0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Our study focusing on the lumbosacral plexus as a possible origin of neuropathy revealed abnormal findings in patients with Hinman syndrome resembling nerve injury series. This is the first known study to provide data showing that Hinman syndrome may have a neuropathic etiology.

It explains step by step how to establish MRN at an institution: how to set up MRN protocols, how to train technicians, what a report needs to contain, and how relevant findings should be communicated to the referring physician. Advanced imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging are only briefly discussed at the end of the article because most of those techniques are difficult for beginners and are still not considered standard in the clinical routine.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used  as a problem-solving tool for diagnosis and management of peripheral neuropathies. This review is aimed at summarizing important technological advances, including MR pulse sequence and surface coil developments, which have facilitated MRN's use in clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: The most recent research in MRN focuses on its clinical applications, with concomitant development of three-dimensional, parallel imaging and vascular suppression techniques that facilitate higher spatial resolution and depiction of small nerve branches arising from the brachial and lumbosacral plexi as well as fascicular abnormalities of more distal extremity nerves. Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been studied as a tool to detect microstructural abnormalities of peripheral nerves and more precisely define grades of nerve injury but will require additional investigation to determine its role in daily clinical practice. MRN continues to evolve due to technological improvements and awareness by the medical community of its capabilities. Additional technological developments related to surface coil designs and vascular suppression techniques will be needed to move the field forward.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of MRI in patients with suspected CRPS  (complex regional pain syndrome). METHOD: A retrospective health-record search was conducted for patients with suspected CRPS (foot). Fifty patients with initially suspected CRPS were included (37 females (51 ± 13 years) and 13 males (44 ± 15 years)). All patients underwent MRI. Two radiologists assessed skin, bone, and soft tissue parameters on MRI. The final diagnosis was CRPS (Gold standard: Budapest criteria) or non-CRPS. MRI parameters were compared between CRPS patients and non-CRPS patients. RESULTS: CRPS was diagnosed in 22/50(44 %) patients. Skin thickness (1.9 ± 0.5 mm vs. 1.7 ± 0.3 mm, p = 0.399), enhancement, and subcutaneous edema showed no differences between CRPS and non-CRPS patients. Bone marrow edema presence and pattern were not different between groups. Up to 50 % of CRPS patients showed no bone marrow edema. Subcortical enhancement and periosteal enhancement were not different between groups. For reader 1, muscle edema score was higher in the non-CRPS group compared to the CRPS group (0.1 ± 0.2 vs. 0.6 ± 1.0, p = 0.008), but not different for reader 2 (0.1 ± 0.5 vs. 0.2 ± 0.8, p = 0.819). Perfusion pattern was more extensive in non-CRPS patients for reader 1 (p = 0.048), but not for reader 2 (p = 0.157). Joint effusions showed no difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: MRI cannot distinguish between CRPS and non-CRPS patients. The role of MR imaging in patients with suspected CRPS is to exclude alternative diagnoses that would better explain patients' symptoms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome is diagnosed based on history, physical  examination, and nerve conduction testing; however, there are no clear criteria for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Recently, studies have aimed to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome through ultrasound or MRI. The purpose of this study was to compare and analyze the cross-sectional area of the median nerve between patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and a control group. METHODS: From July 2015 to August 2017, we retrospectively analyzed fishery and white-collar workers (164 people, 37 men, 127 women). Carpal tunnel syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of both physical examination and nerve conduction testing. A negative result in either test led to exclusion from the study. RESULTS: In total, 164 wrist MRI were retrieved, with 67 patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and 97 patients allocated to the control group. The mean value of cross-sectional area at the pisiform was 18.8 mm(2) in the MRI of the carpal tunnel syndrome patients and 12.1 mm(2) (p-value <0.05) in the control group. The mean value of cross-sectional area at the hook of hamate was 11.70 mm(2) and that at the control group was 11.67 mm(2) (p-value 0.055). CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional area at pisiform in MRI is a valuable factor in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome and in predicting the duration of pain.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  technique that measures the extent of restricted water diffusion and anisotropy in biological tissue. Although DTI has been widely applied in the brain, more recently researchers have used it to characterize nerve pathology in the setting of entrapment neuropathy, traumatic injury, and tumor. DTI artifacts are exacerbated when imaging off isocenter in the body. Anecdotally, the most significant artifacts in peripheral nerve DTI include magnetic field inhomogeneity, motion, incomplete fat suppression, aliasing, and distortion. High spatial resolution is also required to reliably evaluate smaller peripheral nerves. This article provides an overview of such technical issues, particularly when trying to apply DTI in the clinical setting, and offers potential solutions.

N2  - AIM: To evaluate if diffusion-tensor-imaging MR-Neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect  lesions of peripheral nerves due to polyneuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Ten patients with type 2 diabetes with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 patients with type 2 diabetes without polyneuropathy (nDPN) as well as 20 healthy controls (HC) were included. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions (tibial nerve) of the lower extremity. Fractional-anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity (mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD)) were calculated and compared to neuropathy severity. Conventional T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density data were obtained from a multi-echo SE sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity of DTI-MRN from receiver operating characteristics (ROC). RESULTS: The proximal and distal FA was lowest in patients with DPN compared with nDPN and HC (p < 0.01). Likewise, proximal and distal RD was highest in patients with DPN (p < 0.01). MD and AD were also significantly different though less pronounced. ROC curve analyses of DTI separated nDPN and DPN with area-under-the-curve values ranging from 0.65 to 0.98. T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density could not differentiate between nDPN and DPN. CONCLUSION: DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher RD. These alterations are likely to reflect both proximal and distal nerve fiber pathology in patients with type 2 diabetes.

N2  - PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is caused by drug-induced  damage to the axons which is not detected easily due to lack of reliable, clinically applicable modalities. Diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) allows for quantitative measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which have been shown to detect nerve injury by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). METHODS: We sought to evaluate if DTI could be used for detection of CIPN in patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane. Patients with h/o exposure to neurotoxic chemotherapy, diabetes, or peripheral neuropathy were excluded. Patients completed pre- and post-chemotherapy MRI of bilateral legs and FACT&GOG-Ntx. Genotyping of single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) was performed to detect known associations with CIPN. RESULTS: We had 14 evaluable patients in this prospective trial. Mean FA values post-chemotherapy were significantly lower than baseline at mid-calf (p < 0.0001) and ankle (p = 0.03). We did not find any significant change in mean ADC values. In patients without symptomatic neuropathy, mean FA values decreased more than symptomatic patients at mid-calf (p < 0.001). Of the 41 genotyped SNVs, only rs8110536 was found to be significantly associated with development of CIPN. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that FA values are indicative of CIPN and differential changes in FA values in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients highlights its potential to be further studied as a predictive biomarker for CIPN. This is the first study to highlight a non-invasive, imaging based, objective biomarker which, if validated, can be translated into clinic easily.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the potential value of magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in characterizing changes in the cervical spinal cord and peripheral nerve roots in vivo in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). METHODS: We developed an MRI protocol with 4 sequences to investigate the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots on a 3 Tesla MRI system. We used 2 anatomical MRI sequences to investigate cross-sectional area (CSA) at each spinal segment and the diameter of ventral and dorsal nerve roots, and two diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques to estimate the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in 10 SMA patients and 20 healthy controls. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in CSA (p > .1), although an 8.5% reduction of CSA in patients compared to healthy controls was apparent at segment C7. DTI data showed a higher AD in grey matter of patients compared to healthy controls (p = .033). Significantly lower MD, AD and RD values were found in rostral nerve roots (C3-C5) in patients (p < .045). CONCLUSIONS: We showed feasibility of an advanced 3 T MRI protocol that allowed differences to be determined between patients and healthy controls, confirming the potential of this technique to assess pathological mechanisms in SMA. After further development and confirmation of findings in a larger sample, these techniques may be used to study disease course of SMA in vivo and evaluate response to survival motor neuron (SMN) augmenting therapy.

N2  - PURPOSE: The recently introduced inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) method  has predominantly been applied for imaging the central nervous system. Future applications of ihMT, such as in peripheral nerves and muscles, will involve imaging in the vicinity of adipose tissues. This work aims to systematically investigate the partial volume effect of fat on the ihMT signal and to propose an efficient fat-separation method that does not interfere with ihMT measurements. METHODS: First, the influence of fat on ihMT signal was studied using simulations. Next, the ihMT sequence was combined with a multi-echo Dixon acquisition for fat separation. The sequence was tested in 9 healthy volunteers using a 3T human scanner. The ihMT ratio (ihMTR) values were calculated in regions of interest in the brain and the spinal cord using standard acquisition (no fat saturation), water-only, in-phase, and out-of-phase reconstructions. The values obtained were compared with a standard fat suppression method, spectral presaturation with inversion recovery. RESULTS: Simulations showed variations in the ihMTR values in the presence of fat, depending on the TEs used. The IhMTR values in the brain and spinal cord derived from the water-only ihMT multi-echo Dixon images were in good agreement with values from the unsuppressed sequence. The ihMT-spectral presaturation with inversion recovery combination resulted in 24%-35% lower ihMTR values compared with the standard non-fat-suppressed acquisition. CONCLUSION: The presence of fat within a voxel affects the ihMTR calculations. The IhMT multi-echo Dixon method does not compromise the observable ihMT effect and can potentially be used to remove fat influence in ihMT.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Several recent studies have focused on microstructural changes in the  trigeminal nerve in trigeminal neuralgia using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, alterations after microvascular decompression (MVD) have rarely been investigated. Furthermore, the trigeminal nerve of asymptomatic individuals also presenting with neurovascular contact/compression (NVC) has not yet been studied. METHODS: Thirty-four patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia and 34 healthy age-matched controls, who were identified as having unilateral NVC signs, underwent both DTI and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for comparison. All trigeminal neuralgia patients underwent a post-surgical MRI scan after 7 days and a follow-up MRI scan within 6-8 months after surgery. The apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured from coronal images in which the nerves from the root exit point to the distal segment were clearly shown. RESULTS: In 34 trigeminal neuralgia patients, the absolute FA value was significantly lower on the affected side (mean FA, 0.34 ± 0.03) than on the unaffected side (mean FA, 0.37 ± 0.05, p < 0.001). The FA ratio was also significantly different between the trigeminal neuralgia group (Rs(FA), 0.92 ± 0.06) and the control group (Rs(FA), 0.99 ± 0.09) (p = 0.001). The absolute ADC value between the two sides in patients and the ratios of ADC between the trigeminal neuralgia and control groups did not show any significant differences (p = 0.21 and 0.29, respectively). However, in 34 healthy subjects presenting with signs of NVC, neither the FA value nor the ADC showed a difference between sides (p > 0.05). The FA ratio of patients showed a significant increase on two follow-up MRI scans compared to the preoperative FA (p = 0.02 and 0.002, respectively), while the ADC ratio showed a significant decrease at 6 months after MVD (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: This study of trigeminal neuralgia due to NVC found that DTI indexes could reflect alterations in the affected trigeminal nerve. Furthermore, a reversible change after MVD surgery could be potentially valuable for monitoring the change in white matter of the trigeminal nerve.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is caused  by heterozygous deletion of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Patients with HNPP present multifocal, reversible sensory/motor deficits due to increased susceptibility to mechanical pressure. Additionally, age-dependent axonal degeneration is reported. We hypothesize that length-dependent axonal loss can be revealed by MRI, irrespective of the multifocal phenotype in HNPP. METHODS: Nerve and muscle MRI data were acquired in the proximal and distal leg of patients with HNPP (n = 10) and matched controls (n = 7). More specifically, nerve magnetization transfer ratios (MTR) were evaluated to assay proximal-to-distal gradients in nerve degeneration, while intramuscular fat percentages (F(per) ) were evaluated to assay muscle fat replacement following denervation. Neurological disabilities were assessed via the Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy score (CMTNS) for correlation with MRI. RESULTS: F(per) values were elevated in HNPP proximal muscle (9.8 ± 2.2%, P = 0.01) compared to controls (6.9 ± 1.0%). We observed this same elevation of HNPP distal muscles (10.5 ± 2.5%, P < 0.01) relative to controls (6.3 ± 1.1%). Additionally, the amplitude of the proximal-to-distal gradient in F(per) was more significant in HNPP patients than controls (P < 0.01), suggesting length-dependent axonal loss. In contrast, nerve MTR values were similar between HNPP subjects (sciatic/tibial nerves = 39.4 ± 2.0/34.2 ± 2.5%) and controls (sciatic/tibial nerves = 37.6 ± 3.8/35.5 ± 1.2%). Proximal muscle F(per) values were related to CMTNS (r = 0.69, P = 0.03), while distal muscle F(per) and sciatic/tibial nerve MTR values were not related to disability. INTERPRETATION: Despite the multifocal nature of the HNPP phenotype, muscle F(per) measurements relate to disability and exhibit a proximal-to-distal gradient consistent with length-dependent axonal loss, suggesting that F(per) may be a viable biomarker of disease progression in HNPP.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to investigate glaucomatous morphological  changes quantitatively in the visual cortex of the brain with voxel-based morphometry (VBM), a normalizing MRI technique, and to clarify the relationship between glaucomatous damage and regional changes in the visual cortex of patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG). METHODS: Thirty-one patients with OAG (age: 55.9 ± 10.7, male: female = 9: 22) and 20 age-matched controls (age: 54.9 ± 9.8, male: female = 10: 10) were included in this study. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the optic nerve was manually measured with T2-weighed MRI. Images of the visual cortex were acquired with T1-weighed 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequencing, and the normalized regional visual cortex volume, i.e., gray matter density (GMD), in Brodmann areas (BA) 17, 18, and 19, was calculated with a normalizing technique based on statistic parametric mapping 8 (SPM8) analysis. We compared the regional GMD of the visual cortex in the control subjects and OAG patients. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between optic nerve CSA and GMD in BA 17, 18, and 19. RESULTS: We found that the normal and OAG patients differed significantly in optic nerve CSA (p < 0.001) and visual cortex GMD in BA 17 (p = 0.030), BA 18 (p = 0.003), and BA 19 (p = 0.005). In addition, we found a significant correlation between optic nerve CSA and visual cortex GMD in BA 19 (r = 0.33, p = 0.023), but not in BA 17 (r = 0.17, p = 0.237) or BA 18 (r = 0.24, p = 0.099). CONCLUSION: Quantitative MRI parametric evaluation of GMD can detect glaucoma-associated anatomical atrophy of the visual cortex in BA 17, 18, and 19. Furthermore, GMD in BA 19 was significantly correlated to the damage level of the optic nerve, as well as the retina, in patients with OAG. This is the first demonstration of an association between the cortex of the brain responsible for higher-order visual function and glaucoma severity. Evaluation of the visual cortex with MRI is thus a very promising potential method for objective examination in OAG.

N2  - PURPOSE: Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease that  affects the development of sensory and autonomic neurons, including those in the cranial nerves. We aimed to determine whether conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could detect morphologic changes in the trigeminal nerves of these patients. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of brain MRI of patients with genetically confirmed FD and age- and sex-matched controls. High-resolution 3D gradient-echo T1-weighted sequences were used to obtain measurements of the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerves. Measurements were obtained using a two-reader consensus. RESULTS: Twenty pairs of trigeminal nerves were assessed in ten patients with FD and ten matched controls. The median (interquartile range) cross-sectional area of the trigeminal nerves in patients with FD was 3.5 (2.1) mm(2), compared to 5.9 (2.0) mm(2) in controls (P < 0.001). No association between trigeminal nerve area and age was found in patients or controls. CONCLUSIONS: Using conventional MRI, the caliber of the trigeminal nerves was significantly reduced bilaterally in patients with FD compared to controls, a finding that appears to be highly characteristic of this disorder. The lack of correlation between age and trigeminal nerve size supports arrested neuronal development rather than progressive atrophy.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of fiber tractography and diffusivity  analysis generated from 3D diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences for preoperative assessment of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. METHOD: MR imaging at 3 T was performed in 22 patients (mean age 41.9 ± 17.1y, 13 women) with histologically confirmed schwannomas (N = 18) and histologically confirmed neurofibromas (N = 11), including a 3D DW turbo spin echo sequence with fat suppression. Diffusion tensor parameters were computed and fiber tracks were determined. Evaluation was performed by two radiologists and one orthopedic surgeon blinded for final diagnosis. Mean diffusivity was computed to allow further assessment of tumor microstructure. Preoperative fascicle visualization was graded, fascicles were categorized regarding anatomical location and amount of fascicles surrounding the tumor. The agreement of imaging findings with intraoperative findings was assessed. RESULTS: On 78.3 % of the DTI images, the fascicle visualization was rated as good or very good. Tractography differences were observed in schwannomas and neurofibromas, showing schwannomas to be significantly more often located eccentrically to the nerve (94.8 %) than neurofibromas (0 %, P < 0.01). Fascicles were significantly more often continuous (87.5 %) in schwannomas, while in neurofibromas, none of the tracks was graded to be continuous (0 %, P = 0.014). A substantial agreement between fiber tracking and surgical anatomy was found regarding the fascicle courses surrounding the tumor (κ = 0.78). Mean diffusivity of schwannomas (1.5 ± 0.2 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was significantly lower than in neurofibromas (1.8 ± 0.2 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; P < 0.001). The Youden index showed an optimal cutoff at 1.7 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s (sensitivity, 0.91; specificity, 0.78; J = 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging allowed to accurately differentiate between schwannomas and neurofibromas and to describe their location in relation to the nerve fascicles for preoperative planning.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the potential of magnetic resonance (MR)  micro-neurography to detect morphological and relaxometric changes in distal tibial nerves in patients affected with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and their associations with clinical and electrophysiological features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 10 subjects affected with CIDP and 10 healthy subjects were examined. Multiple MR parameters, including the number of fascicles (N), fascicles diameter (FD), total fascicles area (FA), epineurium area (EA), total nerve area (NA), fascicles to nerve ratio (FNR) and quantitative T2 and proton density (PD) were investigated on high resolution MR images of the distal tibial nerve. Those parameters were correlated with clinical scores, age of onset, disease duration and electrophysiologic data. RESULTS: Median NA and FA were significantly increased in the CIDP population (median values for NA in cm(2) in CIDP: 0.185; controls: 0.135; p: 0.028; for FA in CIDP 0.136; controls 0.094; p: 0.021). There was no correlation between the parameters investigated and clinical or electrophysiologic features. CONCLUSION: MR microneurography can detect increased total nerve and fascicle area in distal tibial nerves in CIDP and may be useful for diagnosing CIDP.

N2  - Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by facial pain that may be sudden, intense,  and recurrent. Our aim was to investigate microstructural tissue changes of the trigeminal nerve in patients with trigeminal neuralgia resulting from neurovascular compression by diffusion tensor imaging, and to test the predictive value of diffusion tensor imaging for determining outcomes after radiofrequency rhizotomy. Forty-three patients with trigeminal neuralgia were recruited, and diffusion tensor imaging was performed before radiofrequency rhizotomy. By selecting the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve manually, we measured the volume of trigeminal nerve, fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. The apparent diffusion coefficient and mean value of fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were compared between the affected and normal side in the same patient, and were correlated with pre-rhizotomy and post-rhizotomy visual analogue scale pain scores. The results showed the affected side had significantly decreased fractional anisotropy, increased apparent diffusion coefficient and radial diffusivity, and no significant change of axial diffusivity. The volume of the trigeminal nerve on affected side was also significantly smaller. There was a trend of fractional anisotropy reduction and visual analogue scale pain score reduction (P = 0.072). The results suggest that demyelination without axonal injury, and decreased size of the trigeminal nerve, are the microstructural abnormalities of the trigeminal nerve in patients with trigeminal neuralgia caused by neurovascular compression. The application of diffusion tensor imaging in understanding the pathophysiology of trigeminal neuralgia, and predicting the treatment effect has potential and warrants further study.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nerve regeneration after an injury should occur in a timely fashion for  function to be restored. Current methods cannot monitor regeneration prior to muscle reinnervation. Diffusion tensor imaging has been previously shown to provide quantitative indices after nerve recovery. The goal of this study was to validate the use of this technology following nerve injury via a series of rat sciatic nerve injury/repair studies. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were prospectively divided by procedure (sham, crush, or cut/repair) and time points (1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after surgery). At the appropriate time point, each animal was euthanized and the sciatic nerve was harvested and fixed. Data were obtained using a 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system. For validation, findings were compared to behavioral testing (foot fault asymmetry and sciatic function index) and cross-sectional axonal counting of toluidine blue-stained sections examined under light microscopy. RESULTS: Sixty-three rats were divided into three treatment groups (sham, n = 21; crush, n = 23; and cut/repair, n = 19). Fractional anisotropy was able to differentiate between recovery following sham, crush, and cut/repair injuries as early as 2 weeks (p < 0.05), with more accurate differentiation thereafter. More importantly, the difference in anisotropy between distal and proximal regions recognized animals with successful and failed recoveries according to behavioral analysis, especially at 12 weeks. In addition, diffusion tension imaging-based tractography provided a visual representation of nerve continuity in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse tensor imaging is an objective and noninvasive tool for monitoring nerve regeneration. Its use could facilitate earlier detection of failed repairs to potentially help improve outcomes.

N2  - PURPOSE: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a  treatable, immune-mediated condition characterised by progressive or relapsing motor and sensory neurological deficits. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, neurophysiological and supportive criteria, but can be challenging. In this study, we quantified the diameter and cross-sectional area of the lumbosacral nerve roots, and explored the imaging characteristics of the sciatic nerves, in patients with CIDP versus healthy controls using MRI. METHODS: MRI of the lumbosacral plexus and both thighs was performed at 3 T. Orthogonal diameter and cross-sectional area of the lumbosacral nerve roots were measured, along with sciatic nerve cross-sectional area at the mid-thigh level. The MRI appearance of the sciatic nerves was also evaluated qualitatively. All measurements were performed by an observer blinded to the diagnosis. RESULTS: 10 patients with CIDP and 10 healthy controls (age and sex-matched) were studied. Lumbosacral nerve root diameter and cross-sectional area were significantly increased in patients with CIDP compared to controls (mean diameter 6.0 ± 1.1 mm vs 4.8 ± 0.3 mm; p = 0.006), with a high sensitivity (89 %) and specificity (90 %) on ROC analysis. Sciatic nerve cross sectional area was also significantly increased in the CIDP group, and was accompanied by qualitative MRI changes. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative MRI reveals significant hypertrophy of the lumbosacral nerve roots and sciatic nerves in patients with CIDP compared to controls. This study provides further evidence for the inclusion of lumbosacral nerve root and sciatic nerve hypertrophy on MRI as a supportive feature in the diagnostic criteria for CIDP.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: While conventional imaging can readily identify ventricular enlargement  in hydrocephalus, structural changes that underlie microscopic tissue injury might be more difficult to capture. MRI-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) uses properties of water motion to uncover changes in the tissue microenvironment. The authors hypothesized that DTI can identify alterations in optic nerve microstructure in children with hydrocephalus. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 21 children (< 18 years old) who underwent DTI before and after neurosurgical intervention for acute obstructive hydrocephalus from posterior fossa tumors. Their optic nerve quantitative DTI metrics of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were compared to those of 21 age-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients with hydrocephalus had increased MD and decreased FA in bilateral optic nerves, compared to controls (p < 0.001). Normalization of bilateral optic nerve MD and FA on short-term follow-up (median 1 day) after neurosurgical intervention was observed, as was near-complete recovery of MD on long-term follow-up (median 1.8 years). CONCLUSIONS: DTI was used to demonstrate reversible alterations of optic nerve microstructure in children presenting acutely with obstructive hydrocephalus. Alterations in optic nerve MD and FA returned to near-normal levels on short- and long-term follow-up, suggesting that surgical intervention can restore optic nerve tissue microstructure. This technique is a safe, noninvasive imaging tool that quantifies alterations of neural tissue, with a potential role for evaluation of pediatric hydrocephalus.

N2  - PURPOSE: By applying diffusor tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with anterior  interosseous nerve syndrome (AINS), this proof of principle study aims to quantify the extent of structural damage of a peripheral nerve at the anatomical level of individual fascicles. METHODS: In this institutional review board approved prospective study 13 patients with spontaneous AINS were examined at 3 Tesla including a transversal T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo and a spin-echo echo-planar-imaging pulse sequence of the upper arm level. Calculations of quantitative DTI parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) for median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles as well as ulnar and radial nerve were obtained. DTI values were compared to each other and to a previously published dataset of 58 healthy controls using one-way Analysis of Variance with Bonferroni correction and p-values <.05 were considered significant. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to assess diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: FA of median nerve lesion fascicles was decreased compared to median nerve non-lesion fascicles, ulnar nerve and radial nerve while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p < .001 for all parameters). Compared to median nerve values of healthy controls, lesion fascicles showed a significant decrease in FA while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p < .001 for all parameters). FA of median nerve non-lesion fascicles showed a weak significant decrease compared to healthy controls (p < .01) while there was no difference in MD, RD, and AD. ROC analyses revealed an excellent diagnostic accuracy of FA, MD and RD in the discrimination of median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles in AINS patients as well as in the discrimination of lesion fascicles and normative median nerve values of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: By applying this functional MR Neurography technique in patients with AINS, this proof of principle study demonstrates that diffusion tensor imaging is feasible to quantify structural nerve injury at the anatomical level of individual fascicles.

N2  - Evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries has classically been based on  clinical and electrophysiologic criteria. US and MRI have been widely used for morphologic assessment of nerve injury sites and concomitant lesions. In the past few years, morphologic MR neurography has significantly increased its clinical applications on the basis of three-dimensional or two-dimensional images with and without fat-suppression techniques. However, these sequences have a major drawback: absence of pathophysiologic information about functional integrity or axonal flow of peripheral nerves. In this scenario, functional MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used as a complementary tool in initial evaluation of peripheral nerve trauma or in assessment of trauma undergoing surgical repair. These approaches provide not only morphologic but also functional information about extent and degree of nerve impairment. Functional MR neurography can also be applied to selection, planning, and monitoring of surgical procedures that can be performed after traumatic peripheral nerve injuries, such as neurorrhaphy, nerve graft, or neurolysis, as it provides surgeons with valuable information about the functional status of the nerves involved and axonal flow integrity. The physical basis of DWI and DTI and the technical adjustments required for their appropriate performance for peripheral nerve evaluation are reviewed. Also, the clinical value of DWI and DTI in assessment of peripheral nerve trauma is discussed, enhancing their potential impact on selection, planning, and monitoring of surgical procedures employed for peripheral nerve repair. Online supplemental material is available for this article. (©)RSNA, 2019.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To detect, localize, and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in amyloid  light chain (AL) amyloidosis by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in correlation with clinical and electrophysiologic findings. METHODS: We prospectively examined 20 patients with AL-polyneuropathy (PNP) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. After detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic testing, the patient group was subdivided into mild and moderate PNP. MRN in a 3.0 tesla scanner with anatomical coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to the tibiotalar joint was performed by using T2-weighted and dual-echo 2-dimensional sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3-dimensional, T2-weighted inversion recovery sequence. Besides evaluation of nerve T2-weighted signal, detailed quantification of nerve injury by morphometric (nerve caliber) and microstructural MRN markers (proton spin density, T2 relaxation time) was conducted. RESULTS: Nerve T2-weighted signal increase correlated with disease severity: moderate (420.2 ± 60.1) vs mild AL-PNP (307.2 ± 17.9; p = 0.0003) vs controls (207.0 ± 6.4; p < 0.0001). Proton spin density was also higher in moderate (tibial: 525.5 ± 53.0; peroneal: 553.6 ± 64.5; sural: 492.0 ± 56.6) and mild AL-PNP (tibial: 431.6 ± 22.0; peroneal: 457.6 ± 21.7; sural: 404.8 ± 25.2) vs controls (tibial: 310.5 ± 14.1; peroneal: 313.6 ± 11.6; sural: 261.7 ± 11.0; p < 0.0001 for all nerves). T2 relaxation time was elevated in moderate AL-PNP only (tibial: p = 0.0106; peroneal: p = 0.0070; sural: p = 0.0190). Tibial nerve caliber was higher in moderate (58.0 ± 8.8 mm(3)) vs mild AL-PNP (46.5 ± 2.5 mm(3); p = 0.008) vs controls (39.1 ± 1.2 mm(3); p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: MRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve injury in AL-PNP in vivo with high sensitivity and in close correlation with the clinical stage. Quantitative parameters are feasible new imaging biomarkers for the detection of early AL-PNP and might help to monitor microstructural nerve tissue changes under treatment.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To use anatomic measurements on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and  ultrasonography (USG) in diagnosing and grading carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) using nerve conduction studies (NCS) as the gold standard. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 26 patients with CTS (45 wrists; 22 female and 4 male patients; mean ± SD age of 49.42 + 14.47 years) and 19 age and sex matched healthy volunteers (32 wrists; 15 female and 4 male volunteers, mean ± SD age of 42.52 + 10.85 years) underwent MRI and USG. Cross-sectional area (CA) of median nerve was measured using free hand ROI at four levels: hamate hook (H0), pisiform bone (PI0), 1 cm proximal (PI1) and 2 cm proximal to PI0 (PI2). Relative median nerve signal intensity (MNSI) was calculated as ratio of median nerve signal intensity with hypothenar muscle signal intensity. Flexor retinacular bowing was calculated at hamate hook level. Echogenicity and Power Doppler vascularity of median nerve were assessed on USG. Independent t-test, chi square test and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used as appropriate. RESULTS: On USG, CA measured at PI0 (95% confidence interval of 0.872-0.987) and retinacular bowing (0.816-0.912), while, on MRI, CA at PI1 (0.874-0.997) were most useful in diagnosing CTS based on the ROC and Zombie plot analysis. Area under curves for CA measurements on USG and MRI were not significantly different. CA at PI1 on MRI (0.752-0.965) was significantly different between minimal to moderate CTS and severe to extreme CTS groups (on NCS). CONCLUSION: CA of median nerve is the most useful parameter to diagnose and grade CTS and USG and MRI are comparable for measurements. Increased retinacular bowing on USG and hypoechogenicity of median nerve increase the diagnostic confidence while MRI helps in picking up important associated conditions.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To delineate the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion  coefficient (ADC) values of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy by diffusion tensor imaging and fiber bundle tracing. METHODS: Thirty patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy and 24 healthy volunteers were assessed using the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury scale. All subjects underwent conventional sagittal T1- and T2-weighted imaging and horizontal 3-dimensional T2 driven equilibrium radiofrequency reset pulse and diffusion tensor imaging scan. The ADC and FA values were measured in the cervical nerve at most stenotic segment and heterolateral nonstenotic segment of patients. RESULTS: Fiber tractography revealed thinned and sparse nerve roots and disruption of the fiber bundles in patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy. The FA values of C5-C8 in healthy volunteers or heterolateral nonstenotic nerve of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy were significantly greater than those of the stenotic cervical segments of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (both P < 0.01). Furthermore, the ADC values of C5-C8 in healthy volunteers or heterolateral nonstenotic nerve of patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy were significantly lower than those of the stenotic cervical segments of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy patients (both P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Fiber tractography is capable of delineating microstructural changes of cervical nerve roots and cervical spondylotic radiculopathy exhibits significant changes in FA and ADC values.

N2  - Krabbe's disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder resulting from  deficiency of β-galactocerebrosidase that affects primarily cerebral white matter and peripheral nerves. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to changes in white matter myelination, but its assessment is based purely on qualitative, visual inspection, and it is subject to interobserver variability and open to reader bias. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced MRI technique that provides quantitative information about the microscopic structural organization of the white matter and changes in cell density and myelination, and it is a suitable MRI tool for studying Krabbe's disease. This Review discusses the available studies on the application of quantitative DTI analysis to assess white matter changes in patients with Krabbe's disease. Quantitative analysis of DTI scalars, especially radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, has been shown to be a sensitive in vivo biomarker of white matter microstructural damage in Krabbe's disease, to detect early white matter injury in asymptomatic neonates with Krabbe's disease, to predict motor and cognitive functions after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and to serve as a measurement for monitoring effects of HSCT on white matter development in Krabbe's disease. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful radiologic tool with the ability to  generate a variety of proton-based signal contrast from tissues. Owing to this immense flexibility in signal generation, new MRI techniques are constantly being developed, tested, and optimized for clinical utility. In addition, the safe and nonionizing nature of MRI makes it a suitable modality for imaging in children. In this review article, we summarize a few of the most popular advances in MRI techniques in recent years. In particular, we highlight how these new developments have affected brain, spine, and neuromuscular imaging and focus on their applications in pediatric patients. In the first part of the review, we discuss new approaches such as multiphase and multidelay arterial spin labeling for quantitative perfusion and angiography of the brain, amide proton transfer MRI of the brain, MRI of brachial plexus and lumbar plexus nerves (i.e., neurography), and T2 mapping and fat characterization in neuromuscular diseases. In the second part of the review, we focus on describing new data acquisition strategies in accelerated MRI aimed collectively at reducing the scan time, including simultaneous multislice imaging, compressed sensing, synthetic MRI, and magnetic resonance fingerprinting. In discussing the aforementioned, the review also summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each method and their current state of commercial availability from MRI vendors.

N2  - Assessment of myelin integrity in peripheral nerve injuries and pathologies has  largely been limited to post-mortem analysis owing to the difficulty in obtaining biopsies without affecting nerve function. This is further encumbered  by the small size of the tissue and its location. Therefore, the development of robust, non-invasive methods is highly attractive. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), to longitudinally and non-invasively characterize both the sciatic nerve crush and lysolecithin (LCP) demyelination models of peripheral nerve injury in rodents. Electrophysiological, gene expression and histological assessments complemented the extensive MRI analyses in young and aged animals. In the nerve crush model, MTR analysis indicated a slower recovery in regions distal to the site of injury in aged animals, as well as incomplete recovery at six weeks post-crush when analyzing across the entire nerve surface. Similar regional impairments were also found in the LCP demyelination model. This research underlines the power of MTR for the study of peripheral nerve injury in small tissues such as the sciatic nerve of rodents and contributes new knowledge to the effect of aging on recovery after injury. A particular advantage of the approach is the translational potential to human neuropathies.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetization transfer contrast imaging provides indirect  information on the concentration of "bound" water protons and their interactions with "free" water molecules. The purpose of this study is to analyze location- and age-dependent changes in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of lower extremity nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten younger (20-32 years) and 5 older (50-63 years) healthy volunteers underwent magnetization transfer contrast imaging at 3 Tesla Two 3-dimensional gradient echo sequences with and without an off-resonance saturation pulse (repetition time: 58 milliseconds; echo time: 2.46 milliseconds; band width: 530 Hz/Px; flip angle: α = 7°) were acquired at 3 different locations covering the proximal thigh to the distal lower leg in the group of younger volunteers and at 2 different locations covering the proximal to distal thigh in the group of older volunteers. Sciatic and tibial nerve regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn and additional ROIs were placed in predetermined muscles. Magnetization transfer ratios were extracted from respective ROIs and calculated for each individual and location. RESULTS: In young volunteers, mean values of nerve and muscle MTR were not different between the proximal thigh (nerve: 20.34 ± 0.91; muscle: 31.71 ± 0.29), distal thigh (nerve: 19.90 ± 0.98; P = 0.76; muscle: 31.53 ± 0.69; P = 0.87), and lower leg (nerve: 20.82 ± 1.07; P = 0.73; muscle: 32.44 ± 1.11; P = 0.51). An age-dependent decrease of sciatic nerve MTR was observed in the group of older volunteers (16.95 ± 1.2) compared with the group of younger volunteers (20.12 ± 0.65; P = 0.019). Differences in muscle MTR were not significant between older (31.01 ± 0.49) and younger (31.62 ± 0.37; P = 0.20) volunteers. CONCLUSION: The MTR of lower extremity nerves shows no proximal-to-distal gradient in young healthy volunteers but decreases with age. For future studies using MTR in peripheral nerve disorders, these findings suggest that referencing magnetization transfer contrast values in terms of age, but not anatomical nerve location is required.

N2  - This chapter summarizes progress in the evaluation of peripheral nerve (PN) lesions  and disorders by imaging techniques encompassing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nerve ultrasound (US). Due to the radiation exposure and limited sensitivity in soft tissue contrast, computed-tomography (CT) plays no significant role in the diagnostic work-up of PN disorders. MRI and US are complementary techniques for the evaluation of peripheral nerves, each having particular advantages and disadvantages. Nerve injury induces intrinsic MRI signal alterations on T2-weighted sequences in degenerating or demyelinating nerve segments as well as in corresponding muscle groups exhibiting denervation which can be exploited diagnostically. Nerve US is based on changes in the nerve echotexture due to tumor formation or focal enlargement caused by entrapment or inflammation. Both MRI and US provide morphological information on the precise site and extent of nerve injury. While US has the advantage of easy accessibility, providing images with superior spatial resolution at low cost, MRI shows better soft tissue contrast and better image quality for deep-lying nerve structures since imaging is not hindered by bone. Recent advances have remarkably increased spatial resolution of both MRI and US making imaging indispensible for the elucidation of causes of nerve compression, peripheral nerve tumors, and focal inflammatory conditions. Both MRI and US further guide neurosurgical exploration and can simplify treatment. Importantly, imaging can reveal treatable conditions even in the absence of gross electrophysiological alterations, illustrating its increasing role in clinical practice. In experimental settings, novel molecular and cellular MRI contrast agents allow in-vivo assessment of nerve regeneration as well as monitoring of neuroinflammation. Depending on further clinical development, contrast-enhanced MRI has the potential to follow cellular responses over time in vivo and to overcome the current limitations of histological assessment of nerve afflictions. Further advances in contrast-enhanced US has the potential for developing into a tool for the assessment of nerve blood perfusion, paving the way for better assessments of ischemic neuropathies.

N2  - PURPOSE: This work describes the development of a method to measure the variation of  apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with diffusion time (Δ) in the brachial plexus, as a potential method of probing microstructure. METHODS: Diffusion-weighted MRI with body signal suppression was used to highlight the nerves from surrounding tissues, and sequence parameters were optimized for sensitivity to change with diffusion time. A porous media-restricted diffusion model based on the Latour-Mitra equation was fitted to the diffusion time-dependent ADC data from the brachial plexus nerves and cord. RESULTS: The ADC was observed to reduce at long diffusion times, confirming that diffusion was restricted in the nerves and cord in healthy subjects. T2 of the nerves was measured to be 80 ± 5 ms, the diffusion coefficient was found to vary from (1.5 ± 0.1) × 10(-3) mm(2) /s at a diffusion time of 18.3 ms to (1.0 ± 0.2) × 10(-3) mm(2) /s at a diffusion time of 81.3 ms. CONCLUSION: A novel method of probing restricted diffusion in the brachial plexus was developed. Resulting parameters were comparable with values obtained previously on biological systems.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and disease monitoring of non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy  (NSVN) are based on electrophysiological and clinical measures. However, these methods are insensitive to detect subtle differences of axonal injury. We here assessed the utility of a multiparametric MRI protocol to quantify axonal injury and neurogenic muscle damage in NSVN. METHODS: Ten NSVN patients and ten age-matched controls were investigated in this single-center prospective study. All participants were assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the tibial nerve and multiecho Dixon MRI of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. These data were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological data. RESULTS: DTI scans of the tibial nerves of patients with NSVN showed significantly lower mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values (0.32 ± 0.02) compared to healthy controls (0.42 ± 0.01). FA values of NSVN patients correlated negatively with clinical measures of pain. Multiecho Dixon MRI scans revealed significantly higher intramuscular fat fractions in the soleus muscle (19.86 ± 6.18% vs. 5.86 ± 0.74%, p = 0.0015) and gastrocnemius muscle (26.09 ± 6.21% vs. 3.59 ± 0.82%, p = 0.0002) in NSVN patients compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a proof of concept that MRI can render information about nerve integrity and muscle pathology in NSVN. Further studies are warranted to evaluate DTI and multiecho Dixon MRI as surrogate markers in NSVN.

N2  - Imaging studies of peripheral nerves have increased considerably in the last ten  years. In addition to the classical and still valid study by ultrasound, new neurographic techniques developed from conventional morphological sequences (including 3D isotropic studies with fat suppression) are making it possible to assess different peripheral nerves and plexuses, including small sensory and/or motor branches, with great precision. Diffusion-weighted sequences and diffusion tensor imaging have opened a new horizon in neurographic studies. This new approach provides morphological and functional information about the internal structure and pathophysiology of the peripheral nerves and diseases that involve them. This update reviews the different MR neurography techniques available for the study of the peripheral nerves, with special emphasis on new sequences based on diffusion.

N2  - PURPOSE: We propose a segmentation methodology for brainstem cranial nerves using  statistical shape model (SSM)-based deformable 3D contours from T(2) MR images. METHODS: We create shape models for ten pairs of cranial nerves. High-resolution T(2) MR images are segmented for nerve centerline using a 1-Simplex discrete deformable 3D contour model. These segmented centerlines comprise training datasets for the shape model. Point correspondence for the training dataset is performed using an entropy-based energy minimization framework applied to particles located on the centerline curve. The shape information is incorporated into the 1-Simplex model by introducing a shape-based internal force, making the deformation stable against low resolution and image artifacts. RESULTS: The proposed method is validated through extensive experiments using both synthetic and patient MRI data. The robustness and stability of the proposed method are experimented using synthetic datasets. SSMs are constructed independently for ten pairs (CNIII-CNXII) of brainstem cranial nerves using ten non-pathological image datasets of the brainstem. The constructed ten SSMs are assessed in terms of compactness, specificity and generality. In order to quantify the error distances between segmented results and ground truths, two metrics are used: mean absolute shape distance (MASD) and Hausdorff distance (HD). MASD error using the proposed shape model is 0.19 ± 0.13 (mean ± std. deviation) mm and HD is 0.21 mm which are sub-voxel accuracy given the input image resolution. CONCLUSION: This paper described a probabilistic digital atlas of the ten brainstem-attached cranial nerve pairs by incorporating a statistical shape model with the 1-Simplex deformable contour. The integration of shape information as a priori knowledge results in robust and accurate centerline segmentations from even low-resolution MRI data, which is essential in neurosurgical planning and simulations for accurate and robust 3D patient-specific models of critical tissues including cranial nerves.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to study changes in the median nerve,  retinaculum, and carpal tunnel on MRI after successful endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR). SUBJECTS AND METHODS. In this prospective study, 35 wrists in 32 patients (five men, 27 women; mean age, 56.7 ± 6.8 [SD] years) with nerve conduction test-confirmed primary carpal tunnel syndrome were evaluated from May 2013 to September 2016. Clinical scores ranging from 0 to 4 (no improvement to symptoms completely resolved) and MRI morphologic features of median nerve and carpal tunnel were evaluated at baseline and 3 and 12 months after ECTR. The paired t test was used to compare MRI parameters before and after ECTR and their relationships to clinical improvement scores. RESULTS. All patients' conditions improved after ECTR with mean clinical improvement scores of 2.94 ± 1.0 at 3 months and 3.49 ± 0.56 at 12 months. Although median nerve swelling did decrease proximally, the nerve remained swollen (> 15 mm(2)) and flattened in all areas, even 12 months after ECTR. Additional changes occurred in median nerve caliber-change ratio, relative signal intensity, and carpal tunnel cross-sectional area. A retinacular gap was present in 33 (94%) wrists 3 months and six (17%) wrists 12 months after ECTR, and increased retinacular bowing persisted. CONCLUSION. After ECTR, undue swelling and flattening of the median nerve persist as long as 12 months after surgery, even in patients with a good surgical outcome. One should be wary of using these MRI findings as signs of persistent neural compression. The retinaculum reforms in most patients within 12 months of surgery but with a more bowed configuration.

N2  - Nerve regeneration after injury must occur in a timely fashion to restore function.  Unfortunately, current methods (e.g., electrophysiology) provide limited information following trauma, resulting in delayed management and suboptimal outcomes. Herein, we evaluated the ability of diffusion MRI to monitor nerve regeneration after injury/repair. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three treatment groups (sham = 21, crush = 23, cut/repair = 19) and ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was performed 1-12 weeks post-surgery. Behavioral data showed a distinction between crush and cut/repair nerves at 4 weeks. This was consistent with DTI, which found that thresholds based on the ratio of radial and axial diffusivities (RD/AD = 0.40 ± 0.02) and fractional anisotropy (FA = 0.53 ± 0.01) differentiated crush from cut/repair injuries. By the 12(th) week, cut/repair nerves whose behavioral data indicated a partial recovery were below the RD/AD threshold (and above the FA threshold), while nerves that did not recover were on the opposite side of each threshold. Additional morphometric analysis indicated that DTI-derived normalized scalar indices report on axon density (RD/AD: r = -0.54, p < 1e-3; FA: r = 0.56, p < 1e-3). Interestingly, higher-order DKI analyses did not improve our ability classify recovery. These findings suggest that DTI may provide promising biomarkers for distinguishing successful/unsuccessful nerve repairs and potentially identify cases that require reoperation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether cochlear nerve (CN) cross-sectional area as measured  with parasagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in prelingual pediatric deaf patients correlates with auditory performance after cochlear implantation. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective Cohort study. METHODS: Thirty-two prelingual children with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) who received unilateral cochlear implant were included in this study. Diameters of CN at Internal auditory canal (IAC) fundus and mid-point of IAC were retrospectively measured on parasagittal images of FIESTA (Fast Imaging Employing Steady-state Acquisition) sequence MRI by two independent observers. Cross-sectional areas [π (Height/2) (Width/2)] were then correlated with post-operative CAPS (Categories of Auditory Performance) and IT-MAIS (Infant-Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale) scores regularly assessed at 3 monthly intervals post device activation. RESULTS: The cochlear nerve was identified in all the 32 patients. Mean cross-sectional areas (CSA) of cochlear nerve were 0.71 ± 0.16 mm(2) at IAC fundus and 0.73 ± 0.18 mm(2) at mid-point of IAC. The correlation value between CSA at mid-point of IAC and CAPS score at 6 months was 0.271 (p-value- 0.140) and correlation value between CSA at mid-point of IAC and IT-MAIS score at 6 months was 0.282 (p-value- 0.124) which were statistically not significant. CONCLUSION: There was no significant correlation between the cross-sectional areas of the cochlear nerve on MRI and postoperative auditory scores as measured by CAPS and IT-MAIS scores at six months from the device activation. Hence, we conclude that above an adequate diameter, which can affect the minimum required neurons, the changes in the diameter do not have significant bearing on auditory outcomes after cochlear implantation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is diagnosed through clinical findings  and genetic testing. While there are neurophysiological tools and clinical functional scales in CMT, objective disease biomarkers that can facilitate in monitoring disease progression are limited. PURPOSE: To investigate the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in determining the microstructural integrity of sciatic and peroneal nerves and its correlation with the MRI grading of muscle atrophy severity and clinical function in CMT as determined by the CMT neuropathy score (CMTNS). STUDY TYPE: Prospective case-control. SUBJECTS: Nine CMT patients and nine age-matched controls. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3 T T(1) -weighted in-/out-of phase spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) and DTI sequences. ASSESSMENT: Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) values for sciatic and peroneal nerves were obtained from DTI. Muscle atrophy was graded according to the Goutallier classification using in-/out-of phase SPGRs. DTI parameters and muscle atrophy grades were compared between CMT and controls, and the relationship between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS were assessed. STATISTICAL TESTS: The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used to compare DTI parameters between CMT and controls. The relationship between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS were analyzed using the Spearman correlation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of DTI parameters that can differentiate CMT from healthy controls were done. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in FA and increase in RD of both nerves (P < 0.05) in CMT, with significant correlations between FA (negative; P < 0.05) and RD (positive; P < 0.05) with muscle atrophy grade. In the sciatic nerve, there was significant correlation between FA and CMTNS (r = -0.795; P < 0.05). FA and RD could discriminate CMT from controls with high sensitivity (77.8-100%) and specificity (88.9-100%). DATA CONCLUSION: There were significant differences of DTI parameters between CMT and controls, with significant correlations between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grade, and CMTNS.

N2  - Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) has been used extensively to study pathological  conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, tissue damage is assessed qualitatively with little information regarding the underlying pathophysiological processes involved. Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging method which is sensitive to tissue macromolecular content and may therefore have an important role in the study of pathologies affecting the PNS. This study explored the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus of healthy volunteers using MRN to identify and segment each lumbar segment (L2-L5) and regions (preganglionic, ganglionic and postganglionic). Reproducibility of the MTR measurements and of the segmentation method were assessed from repeated measurements (scan-rescan), and from the reanalysis of images (intra- and inter-rater assessment), by calculating the coefficient of variation (COV). In all segments combined (L2-L5), mean (± SD) MTR was 30.5 (± 2.4). Scan-rescan, intra- and inter-rater COV values were 3.2%, 4.4% and 5.3%, respectively. One-way analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference in MTR between the preganglionic and postganglionic regions in all lumbar segments. This pilot study in healthy volunteers demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus, opening up the possibility of studying a broad spectrum of neurological conditions in vivo.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To detect and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis  (MS) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). METHODS: Thirty-six patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing-remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease-modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age-/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. Three Tesla MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2-dimensional (2D) fat-saturated, T2-weighted (T2w) and dual echo turbo spin echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton spin density and T2 relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion. RESULTS: T2w hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients, with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5 ± 5.7 versus 19.1 ± 2.4 in controls (p < 0.0001). Nerve proton spin density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8 ± 7.7/368.9 ± 8.2) versus controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0 ± 11.0/276.8 ± 9.7, p < 0.0001). In contrast, T2 relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal: 82.0 ± 2.1/78.3 ± 1.7) versus MS (tibial/peroneal: 64.3 ± 1.0/61.2 ± 0.9, p < 0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial: 52.4 ± 2.1mm(2) , peroneal: 25.4 ± 1.3mm(2) ) versus controls (tibial: 45.2 ± 1.4mm(2) , p < 0.0015; peroneal: 21.3 ± 0.7mm(2) , p = 0.0049). INTERPRETATION: Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS in vivo by high-resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton spin density and a decrease of T2 relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS. Ann Neurol 2017;82:676-685.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation between  neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) germline mutations and imaging features of neurofibromas on whole-body MRI (WBMRI) by using radiomics image analysis techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with NF1 who had known germline mutations determined by targeted next-generation sequencing were selected from a previous WBMRI study using coronal short tau inversion recovery sequence. Each tumor was segmented in WBMRI and a set of 59 imaging features was calculated using our in-house volumetric image analysis platform, 3DQI. A radiomics heatmap of 59 imaging features was analyzed to investigate the per-tumor and per-patient associations between the imaging features and mutation domains and mutation types. Linear mixed-effect models and one-way analysis of variance tests were performed to assess the similarity of tumor imaging features within mutation groups, between mutation groups, and between randomly selected groups. RESULTS: A total of 218 neurofibromas (97 discrete neurofibromas and 121 plexiform neurofibromas) were identified in 19 of the 29 patients. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering in heatmap analysis revealed 6 major image feature patterns that were significantly correlated with gene mutation domains and types with strong to very strong associations of genotype-phenotype correlations in both per-tumor and per-patient studies (p < 0.05, Cramer V > 0.5), whereas tumor size and locations showed no correlations with imaging features (p = 0.79 and p = 0.42, respectively). The statistical analyses revealed that the number of significantly different features (SDFs) within mutation groups were significantly lower than those between mutation groups (mutation domains: 10.9 ± 9.5% vs 31.9 ± 23.8% and mutation types: 31.8 ± 30.7% vs 52.6 ± 29.3%). The first and second quartile p values of within-patient groups were more than 2 times higher than those between-patient groups. However, the numbers of SDFs between randomly selected groups were much lower (approximately 5.2%). CONCLUSION: This preliminary study identified the NF1 radiogenomics linkage between NF1 causative mutations and MRI radiomic features, i.e., the correlation between NF1 genotype and imaging phenotype on WBMRI.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a significant neurological  issue that may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. When evaluating patients with traumatic brain injury, it is crucial to identify those with high ICP in order to expedite ICP lowering measures and maintain adequate cerebral perfusion. Several measures are used to recognise patients with increased ICP including CT scan, MRI, ICP monitor, and lumbar puncture (LP). However, these tests can be invasive, associated with radiation exposure, contraindicated, or not readily available. Ultrasonography measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is proposed as a non-invasive and quick measure to identify high ICP. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be to examine the accuracy of ONSD sonography for increased ICP diagnosis. METHODS AND ANALYSES: We will include published and unpublished randomised controlled trials, observational studies, and abstracts, with no publication type or language restrictions. Search strategies will be designed to peruse the MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, WHO Clinical Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library databases. We will also implement strategies to search grey literature. Two reviewers will independently complete data abstraction and conduct quality assessment. Included studies will be assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. We will construct the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve for included studies and pool sensitivity and specificity using the bivariate model. We also plan to conduct prespecified subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence will be rated using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics board approval is not required for this study as it draws from published data and raises no concerns related to patient privacy. This review will provide a comprehensive assessment of the evidence on ONSD sonography diagnostic accuracy and is directed to a wide audience. Results from the review will be disseminated extensively through conferences and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017055485. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Trial registration number is NCT00783809.

N2  - Peripheral nerve imaging is recognized as a complement to clinical and  neurophysiological assessment in the evaluation of peripheral nerves with the ability to impact patient management, even for small and difficult nerves. The European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, suggest to use ultrasound (US) for nerve evaluation due to the fact that, in sever anatomical area, magnetic resonance imaging is not able to give additional informations. US could be considered the first-choice approach for the assessment of peripheral nerves. The relative drawback of peripheral nerve US is the long learning curve and the deep anatomic competence to evaluate even small nerves. In the recent years, the role of US in peripheral nerve evaluation has been widened. In the past, nerve US was mainly used to assess nerve-cross sectional area, but now more advanced measurements and considerations are desirable and can boost the role of peripheral nerve US. Nerve echotexture evaluation was defined in 2010: The ratio between the hypoechoic and hyperechoic areas of peripheral nerves on US was called "nerve density". For evaluation of patients who have peripheral neuropathies, the role of peripheral nerve is US wider than simple cross-sectional area evaluation. Quantitative measurements describing the internal fascicular echotexture of peripheral nerves introduce the concept of considering US as a possible quantitative imaging biomarker technique. The potential of nerve US has started to be uncovered. It seems clear that only cross-sectional area measurement is no more sufficient for a comprehensive US evaluation of peripheral nerves.

N2  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the relationship between the area around the distal radioulnar  joint according to the ulnar variances and the cross-sectional area using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in this prospective study of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: From among a total of 243 patients who had been diagnosed with CTS between March 2012 and February 2017 at our hospital, 41 patients with positive ulnar variance were enrolled in group 1. As control groups, 39 healthy volunteers who underwent MRI evaluations were included in group 2 (neutral ulnar variance) and group 3 (negative variance). Basic demographic data, including age, sex, and body mass index, were recorded for all 3 groups. An area encompassing the contents of carpal tunnel (nerves/tendons) was designated as area "A," and the area just beneath the subcutaneous fat was designated as area "B" at the levels of the lunate (L) and pisiform (P) on axial MRI. Ratios of these areas ("A/B at L" and "A/B at P") were evaluated in terms of their correlations with ulnar variance. RESULTS: Mean age, sex, and body mass index were not statistically different among the groups, respectively. Within each group, there was no difference between "A/B at L" and "A/B at P," respectively. When comparing the 3 groups, "A/B at L" and "A/B at P" were all significantly decreased in group 1 than in other groups. Regardless of the group, ulnar length negatively correlated with both "A/B at L" and "A/B at P" ratios. CONCLUSIONS: We found a positive relationship between decreased cross-sectional area around the distal radioulnar joint and positive ulnar variance on radiologic investigation. These findings show the importance of variance in the positive ulna variance to the development of CTS.

N2  - Repetitive electrical activity produces microstructural alteration in myelinated  axons, which may afford the opportunity to noninvasively monitor function of myelinated fibers in peripheral nervous system (PNS)/CNS pathways. Microstructural changes were assessed via two different magnetic-resonance-based approaches: diffusion fMRI and dynamic T(2) spectroscopy in the ex vivo perfused bullfrog sciatic nerves. Using this robust, classical model as a platform for testing, we demonstrate that noninvasive diffusion fMRI, based on standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can clearly localize the sites of axonal conduction blockage as might be encountered in neurotrauma or other lesion types. It is also shown that the diffusion fMRI response is graded in proportion to the total number of electrical impulses carried through a given locus. Dynamic T(2) spectroscopy of the perfused frog nerves point to an electrical-activity-induced redistribution of tissue water and myelin structural changes. Diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) reveals a reversible shift of tissue water into a restricted isotropic diffusion signal component. Submyelinic vacuoles are observed in electron-microscopy images of tissue fixed during electrical stimulation. A slowing of the compound action potential conduction velocity accompanies repetitive electrical activity. Correlations between electrophysiology and MRI parameters during and immediately after stimulation are presented. Potential mechanisms and interpretations of these results are discussed.

N2  - The group of Multiplied, Added, Subtracted and/or fiTted Inversion Recovery (MASTIR)  pulse sequences in which usually two or more inversion recovery (IR) images of different types are combined is described, and uses for this type of sequence are outlined. IR sequences of different types can be multiplied, added, subtracted, and/or fitted together to produce variants of the MASTIR sequence. The sequences provide a range of options for increasing image contrast, demonstrating specific tissues and fluids of interest, and suppressing unwanted signals. A formalism using the concept of pulse sequences as tissue property filters is used to explain the signal, contrast and weighting of the pulse sequences with both univariate and multivariate filter models. Subtraction of one magnitude reconstructed IR image from another with a shorter TI can produce very high T(1) dependent positive contrast from small increases in T(1). The reverse subtracted IR sequence can provide high positive contrast enhancement with gadolinium chelates and iron deposition which decrease T(1). Additional contrast to that arising from increases in T(1) can be produced by supplementing this with contrast arising from concurrent increases in ρ(m) and T(2), as well as increases or decreases in diffusion using subtraction IR with echo subtraction and/or diffusion subtraction. Phase images may show 180º differences as a result of rotating into the transverse plane both positive and negative longitudinal magnetization. Phase images with contrast arising in this way, or other ways, can be multiplied by magnitude IR images to increase the contrast of the latter. Magnetization Transfer (MT) and susceptibility can be used with IR sequences to improve contrast. Selective images of white and brown adipose tissue lipid and water components can be produced using different TIs and in and out-of-phase TEs. Selective images of ultrashort and short T(2) tissue components can be produced by nulling long T(2) tissue components with an inversion pulse and subtraction of images with longer TEs from images with ultrashort TEs. The Double Echo Sliding IR (DESIRE) sequence provides images with a wide range of TIs from which it is possible to choose values of TI to achieve particular types of tissue and/or fluid contrast (e.g., for subtraction with different TIs, as described above, and for long T(2) tissue signal nulling with UTE sequences). Unwanted tissue and fluid signals can be suppressed by addition and subtraction of phase-sensitive (ps) and magnitude reconstructed images. The sequence also offers options for synergistic use of the changes in blood and tissue ρ(m), T(1), T(2)/T(2)*, D* and perfusion that can be seen with fMRI of the brain. In-vivo and ex-vivo illustrative examples of normal brain, cartilage, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and peripheral nerve imaged with different forms of the MASTIR sequence are included.

N2  - Diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies relies on neurological examinations,  electrodiagnostic studies, and since recently magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a fully-automatic segmentation method of peripheral nerves of the thigh. T2-weighted sequences without fat suppression acquired on a 3 T MR scanner were retrospectively analyzed in 10 healthy volunteers and 42 patients suffering from clinically and electrophysiologically diagnosed sciatic neuropathy. A fully-convolutional neural network was developed to segment the MRN images into peripheral nerve and background tissues. The performance of the method was compared to manual inter-rater segmentation variability. The proposed method yielded Dice coefficients of 0.859 ± 0.061 and 0.719 ± 0.128, Hausdorff distances of 13.9 ± 26.6 and 12.4 ± 12.1 mm, and volumetric similarities of 0.930 ± 0.054 and 0.897 ± 0.109, for the healthy volunteer and patient cohorts, respectively. The complete segmentation process requires less than one second, which is a significant decrease to manual segmentation with an average duration of 19 ± 8 min. Considering cross-sectional area or signal intensity of the segmented nerves, focal and extended lesions might be detected. Such analyses could be used as biomarker for lesion burden, or serve as volume of interest for further quantitative MRN techniques. We demonstrated that fully-automatic segmentation of healthy and neuropathic sciatic nerves can be performed from standard MRN images with good accuracy and in a clinically feasible time.

N2  - PURPOSE: To study optic disc in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with  diffusion tensor imaging. METHODS: Prospective study was carried out on 31 consecutive patients with IIH and 17 age and sex-matched controls that underwent diffusion tensor imaging of optic nerve. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of optic disc were measured by two readers. Grades of papilledema and visual field defects were evaluated by ophthalmologist. RESULTS: FA of optic disc was significantly lower in IIH than controls (p = 0.001) with excellent inter-observer agreement (K = 0.93) of both readers. The cutoff FA used to differentiating IIH from controls were 0.28 and 0.29 with area under curve (AUC) of 0.921 and 0.914, accuracy 92% and 91%, and sensitivity 97% and 96%. MD of optic disc were significantly higher in IIH than in controls (p = 0.001) with excellent inter-observer agreement (K = 0.91) of both readers. The cutoff MD used to differentiating IIH from controls was 1.51 and 1.22 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s with AUC 0.943 and 0.922, and accuracy 94% and 92% respectively. FA of optic disc was significantly lower in early than advanced papilledema and visual field defects (p = 0.001, 0.001) respectively. The MD of optic disc was significantly higher in early than advanced papilledema and visual field defects (p = 0.001, 0.001) respectively. CONCLUSION: Diffusion tensor imaging parameters of optic disc are non-invasive reliable imaging parameters that can be used for diagnosis of IIH and well correlated with papilledema and visual field defects.

Analysis of the resulting image data allows for the determination of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), as well as allowing three-dimensional visualization of the fiber tract (tractography). We visualized the ulnar nerve of ten healthy volunteers with DTI. We found FA to be 0.752 ± 0.067 and the ADC to be 0.96 ± 0.13 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s. A nuts-and-bolts description of the physical aspects of DTI is provided as an educational process for readers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the value of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) for characterization of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). METHODS: Twenty-six patients with NF1 and suspicion of malignant transformation of PNSTs were prospectively enrolled and underwent DW MRI at 3T. For a set of benign (n = 55) and malignant (n = 12) PNSTs, functional MRI parameters were derived from both biexponential intravoxel incoherent motion (diffusion coefficient D and perfusion fraction f) and monoexponential data analysis (apparent diffusion coefficients [ADCs]). A panel of morphological MRI features was evaluated using T1- and T2-weighted imaging. Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher's exact test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative and qualitative MRI. Cohen's kappa was used to determine interrater reliability. RESULTS: Malignant PNSTs demonstrated significantly lower diffusivity (P < 0.0001) compared with benign PNSTs. The perfusion fraction f was significantly higher in malignant PNSTs (P < 0.001). In ROC analysis, functional MRI parameters showed high diagnostic accuracy for differentiation of PNSTs (eg, ADCmean, 92% sensitivity with 98% specificity, AUC 0.98; Dmean, 92% sensitivity with 98% specificity, AUC 0.98). By contrast, morphological imaging features had only limited sensitivity (18-94%) and specificity (18-82%) for identification of malignancy. Interrater reliability was higher for monoexponential data analysis. CONCLUSION: DW imaging shows better diagnostic performance than morphological features and allows accurate differentiation of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1.

N2  - Recent developments in the field of peripheral nerve imaging extend the capabilities  of imaging modalities to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with peripheral nerve maladies. Methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its derivative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), ultrasound (US) and positron emission tomography (PET) are capable of assessing nerve structure and function following injury and relating the state of the nerve to electrophysiological and histological analysis. Of the imaging methods surveyed here, each offered unique and interesting advantages related to the field. MRI offered the opportunity to visualize immune activity on the injured nerve throughout the course of the regeneration process, and DTI offered numerical characterization of the injury and the ability to develop statistical bases for diagnosing injury. US extends imaging to the treatment phase by enabling more precise analgesic applications following surgery, and PET represents a novel method of assessing nerve injury through analysis of relative metabolism rates in injured and healthy tissue. Exciting new possibilities to enhance and extend the abilities of imaging methods are also discussed, including innovative contrast agents, some of which enable multimodal imaging approaches and present opportunities for treatment application.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies demonstrated that soft tissues, such as retinaculum,  fibrous band, and anconeus, cause ulnar nerve compression, whereas other studies showed that the bony structures strain the ulnar nerve that runs directly behind the medial epicondyle constituting the boundary of the cubital tunnel during elbow flexion. However, no studies have reported the association of the shape of the bony structure with cubital tunnel syndrome symptoms. Are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-measured parameters of the bony cubital tunnel related to idiopathic cubital tunnel syndrome symptoms? HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that CT and MRI-measured parameters of the bony cubital tunnel were related to idiopathic cubital tunnel syndrome symptoms. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the radiographic parameters based on CT and MRI and idiopathic cubital tunnel syndrome symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 224 elbows (77 affected elbows of patients with idiopathic cubital tunnel syndrome, 77 unaffected elbows of patients with cubital tunnel syndrome, 70 elbows of patients without cubital tunnel syndrome symptoms) using CT and MRI. Cubital tunnel cross-sectional area, cubital tunnel volume, and ulnar nerve cross-sectional area were measured in the three groups at flexion and extension. A new cubital tunnel center with a new boundary was proposed that could play a role in ulnar nerve compression symptoms. RESULTS: The cross-sectional areas and volumes of the cubital tunnel measured in the elbow flexion state were the smallest among the group with the affected elbows in patients. There was no difference between unaffected elbows and the non-patient group. The cross-sectional area of the ulnar nerve highly correlated with cubital tunnel symptoms in the flexion state. DISCUSSION: The shape of the cubital tunnel is an important factor in cubital tunnel syndrome, and normal variations in the volume and cross-sectional area of the cubital tunnel and ulnar nerve could influence the occurrence of idiopathic cubital tunnel syndrome. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, Therapeutic study.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a powerful MR imaging technique that can be used  to probe the microstructural environment of highly anisotropic tissues such as peripheral nerves. DTI has been used predominantly in the central nervous system, and its application in the peripheral nervous system does pose some challenges related to imaging artifacts, the small caliber of peripheral nerves, and low water proton density. However advances in MRI hardware and software have made it possible to use the technique in the peripheral nervous system and to obtain functional data relating to the effect of pathologic processes on peripheral nerves. This article reviews the imaging principles behind DTI and examines the literature regarding its application in assessing peripheral nerves.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Muscle MRI is of increasing importance for neuromuscular patients to  detect changes in muscle volume, fat-infiltration, and edema. We developed a method for semi-automated segmentation of muscle MRI datasets. METHODS: An active contour-evolution algorithm implemented within the ITK-SNAP software was used to segment T1-weighted MRI, and to quantify muscle volumes of neuromuscular patients (n = 65). RESULTS: Semi-automated compared with manual segmentation was shown to be accurate and time-efficient. Muscle volumes and ratios of thigh/lower leg volume were lower in myopathy patients than in controls (P < .0001; P < .05). We found a decrease of lower leg muscle volume in neuropathy patients compared with controls (P < .01), which correlated with clinical parameters. In myopathy patients, muscle volume showed a positive correlation with muscle strength (r(left) = 0.79, p(left) < .0001). Muscle volumes were independent of body mass index and age. CONCLUSIONS: Our method allows for exact and time-efficient quantification of muscle volumes with possible use as a biomarker in neuromuscular patients.

N2  - PURPOSE: To explore the brain microstructural and functional changes in patients  with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 12 PHN patients and 12 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) sequences were scanned by a 3T MR scanner. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) t-maps were obtained following DTI data processing. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were obtained following rfMRI data processing. A two sample t-test was performed to compare the FA, MD, ALFF and fALFF differences between the PHN patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted with regard to the parameters gender, age and education years between the two groups. FA, MD, ALFF and/or fALFF indicated significant alterations in specific pain or pain-related brain regions, such as brainstem, cerebellum, parietal lobe, precuneus, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, postcentral and precentral gyrus, corpus callosum, cingulate gyrus, putamen and insula. CONCLUSION: Multi-local alterations of spontaneous brain activity could form a network related to chronic pain, sensory discrimination, emotion and cognition, suggesting complicated central mechanisms of PHN. The combined-action of brain microstructure and function may play a critical role in comprehension of neurological mechanisms of PHN-induced pain.

N2  - BACKGROUND: As diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is able to assess tissue integrity,  authors used diffusion to detect abnormalities in trigeminal nerves (TGN) in patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) caused by neurovascular compression (NVC) who had undergone microvascular decompression (MVD). The authors also studied anatomical TGN parameters (cross-sectional area [CSA] and volume [V]). The study compared pre- and postoperative findings. METHODS: Using DTI sequencing on a 3-T MRI scanner, we measured the fraction of anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the TGN in 10 patients who had undergone MVD for TN and in 6 normal subjects. We compared data between affected and unaffected nerves in patients and both nerves in normal subjects (controls). We then correlated these data with CSA and V. Data from the affected side and the unaffected side before and 4 years after MVD were compared. RESULTS: Before MVD, the FA of the affected side (0.37 ± 0.03) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared to the unaffected side in patients (0.48 ± 0.03) and controls (0.52 ± 0.02), and the ADC in the affected side (5.6 ± 0.34 mm(2)/s) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to the unaffected side in patients (4.26 ± 0.25 mm(2)/s) and controls (3.84 ± 0.18 mm(2)/s). Affected nerves had smaller V and CSA compared to unaffected nerves and controls (p < 0.05). After MVD, the FA in the affected side (0.41 ± 0.02) remained significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared to the unaffected side (0.51 ± 0.02), but the ADC in the affected side (4.24 ± 0.34 mm(2)/s) had become similar (p > 0.05) to the unaffected side (4.01 ± 0.33 mm(2)/s). CONCLUSIONS: DTI revealed a loss of anisotropy and an increase in diffusivity in affected nerves before surgery. Diffusion alterations correlated with atrophic changes in patients with TN caused by NVC. After removal of the compression, the loss of FA remained, but ADC normalized in the affected nerves, suggesting improvement in the diffusion of the trigeminal root.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study compares median nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements  at the wrist obtained with ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using cadaveric measurements as the gold standard. METHODS: Median nerve CSA was measured using US and MRI in 9 cadaveric wrists obtained from 5 subjects at 5 locations: distal forearm, proximal to tunnel inlet, at tunnel inlet, at tunnel outlet, and distal to tunnel outlet and then on identical cadaveric transverse sections obtained with a bandsaw. All US, MRI, and cadaveric measurements were repeated to determine reliability. Median nerves of 10 patients with clinical carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were measured with US and MRI using an identical method US. RESULTS: Median nerve CSA MRI measurements correlated better (Pearson correlation: 0.80-0.95, P < .05) with cadaveric measurements than with US measurements (Pearson correlation: 0.61-0.79, P < .05). Median nerve CSA US measurements (8.6-12.5 mm(2) , P < .05) were smaller at all levels than MRI (11.3-14.7 mm(2) ) or cadaveric (11.0-14.9 mm(2) ) measurements while MRI and cadaver measurements were similar at all levels. Median nerve CSA MRI measurements in CTS patients were larger than US measurements at all levels. CONCLUSION: Median nerve CSA measurements by MRI are larger than US measurements and correlated better with cadaveric measurements. Median nerve CSA criteria used for diagnosing CTS on US are not likely to be applicable to MRI.

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine dorsal root ganglia and proximal nerve segments in patients  carrying the Fabry-related GLA-gene variant p.D313Y in comparison to patients with classical Fabry mutations and healthy controls by morphometric and functional magnetic resonance neurography. METHODS: This prospective multicenter study examines the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve in 11 female p.D313Y patients by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3 T. Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3 to S2, permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1, and spinal nerve L5 as well as cross-sectional area of the sciatic nerve were assessed and compared to 10 females carrying a classical Fabry mutation and 16 healthy female controls. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, dorsal root ganglia volumes of p.D313Y females were enlarged by 53% (L3), 48% (L4), 43% (L5), 57% (S1) (p < 0.001), and 55% (S2) (p < 0.05), but less pronounced compared to females carrying a classical Fabry mutation. Compared to healthy controls, p.D313Y patients showed no changes of dorsal root ganglia vascular permeability, while patients with a classical Fabry mutation showed a distinct decrease (p < 0.05). Sciatic nerve cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6% in p.D313Y as well as in classical Fabry patients (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients carrying the GLA-gene variant p.D313Y show distinctly enlarged dorsal root ganglia, while vascular permeability remains within normal limits. Overall, these alterations partially share characteristics commonly seen in patients with a mutation causing classical FD. This suggests that p.D313Y causes a potentially treatable condition resembling an early stage of Fabry disease.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the magnetic resonance (MRI) features of the  superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and to track changes to it induced using radiotherapy across a long-term follow-up. METHODS: In total, 75 patients who underwent radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies and who were studied with MRI were recruited from two centers. MRI was performed before and after radiotherapy, with a median long-term follow-up of 4.5 years. Baseline SCG features were assessed. Changes in axial cross-sectional area, T2-normalized signal, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) (the latter available in about half of the patients) were analyzed. Repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni's correction was used to analyze changes in the aforementioned parameters (significance level 0.05). RESULTS: Out of a potential 149 SCGs, 136 were visible at baseline MRI. A variable spatial relationship with the internal carotid artery was found. SCGs showed the "black dot" sign in almost all of the patients. ADC was higher in SCGs than in regional lymph nodes. Cross-sectional area, normalized T2, and ADC increased in the period up to 1 year after radiotherapy and then remained stable in subsequent longer-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: The SCG has unusual features that allow differentiation from the regional lymph nodes. Changes in morphology and signal after radiotherapy must be taken into account by radiologists to avoid misdiagnosis as recurrent nodal disease. Changes induced using radiotherapy are stable in long-term follow-up and are thus likely attributed to other factors (such as Schwann cell hypertrophy/proliferation) rather than edema.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to detect microstructural  alteration and effect of surgical treatment of the trigeminal nerve root (TR) in patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia (CTN) underwent microvascular decompression (MVD). Patients with CTN without neurovascular compression (woNVC) is a special population of TN, however, the pathogenesy of CTN woNVC and the mechanism of internal neurolysis (IN) remain unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 21 patients with CTN woNVC who underwent IN and 20 healthy controls were included in this study. The differences in the means, kurtosis and skewness of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between the affected and unaffected nerves in patients and both nerves in controls were investigated by independent t-test and paired t-test respectively. Longitudinal changes of FA and ADC were correlated with outcome of IN via Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in preoperative mean and kurtosis values for both FA and ADC of the affected side TR, compared to the unaffected side and control group respectively. However, these differences remarkably reduced postoperatively. Further, the Spearman correlation coefficient showed a strong negative correlation between decrease of ADC in the affected side and the surgical outcome in BNI total score. CONCLUSION: The changes of diffusive property of TR, especially the FA and ADC, provide alternative radiological evidence for evaluating the mechanism of CTN woNVC. The modification of DTI metrics could be an effective factor for providing potential noninvasive biomarkers for determining the prognosis of patients with CTN woNVC underwent IN.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Adequate diagnosis of acute anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION)  is challenging to achieve with traditional medical imaging approaches. The aim of this study was to evaluate the detection capacity of diffusion tensor imaging for abnormalities of the optic nerve in acute AION patients. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging data were collected from 31 patients with acute AION and 20 healthy subjects. The mean fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion co-efficient subsequently were evaluated across all subjects. RESULTS: In affected nerves, the mean fractional anisotropy was reduced and the mean apparent diffusion co-efficient was increased in acute AION patients compared with control nerves (p < 0.001), as well as clinically unaffected contralateral nerves (p < 0.001). The mean fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion co-efficient demonstrated no difference between normal control nerves and clinically unaffected contralateral nerves (p = 0.73 and 0.92, respectively). CONCLUSION: Diffusion tensor imaging of the optic nerves demonstrated diagnostic potential for acute AION and could serve as a novel tool for the detection and evaluation of therapies.

N2  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is increasingly being used in magnetic  resonance neurography (MRN). The purpose of this study was to determine the interreader and test-retest reliability of peripheral nerve DTI in MRN with focus on the sciatic nerve. METHODS: In this prospective study 27 healthy volunteers each underwent 3 scans of a short DTI protocol on separate days consisting of a T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and single-shot DTI sequence of the sciatic nerve of the dominant leg. The DTI parameters fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were obtained after manual nerve segmentation by two independent readers. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and Bland-Altman plots were calculated as measures for both interreader and test-retest agreement for all readout parameters. RESULTS: The mean ± standard deviation was 0.507 ± 0.05 for FA, 1308.5 ± 162.4 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s for MD, 905.6 ± 145.4 ×10(-6) mm(2)/s for RD and 2114.1 ± 219.2 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s for AD. The SEM for FA was 0.02 for interreader and test-retest agreement, the SEM for MD, RD, and AD ranged between 46.2 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s (RD) and 70.1 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s (AD) for interreader reliability and between 45.9 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s (RD) and 70.1 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s (AD) for test-retest reliability. The ICC for interreader reliability of DTI parameters ranged between 0.81 and 0.92 and ICC for test-retest reliability between 0.76 and 0.91. CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve DTI of the sciatic nerve is reliable and reproducible. The measures presented here may serve as first orientation values of measurement accuracy when interpreting parameters of sciatic nerve DTI.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Elevation of intracranial pressure in idiopathic intracranial  hypertension induces an edema of the prelaminar section of the optic nerve (papilledema). Beside the commonly observed optic nerve sheath distention, information on a potential pathology of the retrolaminar section of the optic nerve and the short-term effect of normalization of intracranial pressure on these abnormalities remains scarce. METHODS: In this exploratory study 8 patients diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension underwent a MRI scan (T2 mapping) as well as a diffusion tensor imaging analysis (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity). In addition, the clinical presentation of headache and its accompanying symptoms were assessed. Intracranial pressure was then normalized by lumbar puncture and the initial parameters (MRI and clinical features) were re-assessed within 26 h. RESULTS: After normalization of CSF pressure, the morphometric MRI scans of the optic nerve and optic nerve sheath remained unchanged. In the diffusion tensor imaging, the fractional anisotropy value was reduced suggesting a tissue decompression of the optic nerve after lumbar puncture. In line with these finding, headache and most of the accompanying symptoms also improved or remitted within that short time frame. CONCLUSION: The findings support the hypothesis that the elevation of intracranial pressure induces a microstructural compression of the optic nerve impairing axoplasmic flow and thereby causing the prelaminar papilledema. The microstructural compression of the optic nerve as well as the clinical symptoms improve within hours of normalization of intracranial pressure.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is common among patients receiving  hemodialysis and deeply influences their daily life. Amyloid deposits are considered the main reason for median nerve compression, but its prevalence is unclear. Therefore, to determine the main region of amyloid deposition inside the carpal tunnel, we measured the cross-sectional area (CSA) of each component of the carpal tunnel in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Thirty-five hemodialysis patients (HD group) and age- and sex-matched 35 non-hemodialysis patients (non-HD group), who underwent the first surgery for CTS in registered hospitals from 2005 to 2015, were retrospectively enrolled. CTS was diagnosed from clinical and electromyographic (EMG) findings. The CSA of carpal tunnel, each of the flexor tendons, and the median nerve at the level of the hook of hamate were measured in T1-weighted axial images in preoperative MRI, by using Synapse OP-A software. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test and Pearson's chi-squared test. RESULTS: The mean age of the HD group was 65.9 years and the dialysis duration was 21.9 (11-35) years. The mean age of the non-HD group was 65.3 years. The CSA of carpal tunnel (p = 0.006), flexor tendon (p = 0.03), and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon (p = 0.04) were bigger in the HD group. However, the median nerve, the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon, and the flexor pollicis longus tendon (FPL) were not significantly different between the two groups. The dialysis duration or age at surgery did not show any strong correlation to each CSA. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that hemodialysis caused expansion of the carpal tunnel due to amyloid deposition as previously described. Hemodialysis also caused expansion of the CSA of the flexor tendon, especially the FDP, possibly because of amyloid deposition inside the tendon. Furthermore, the duration of dialysis or age did not correlate with any CSA, which could be due to the good progress of the beta 2-microglobulin removal technique. Based on our results, FDS excision could be considered in case severe deposition of amyloid in FDP is observed during surgery.

N2  - In vivo human optic nerve diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is technically  challenging with two outstanding issues not yet well addressed: (i) non-linear optic nerve movement, independent of head motion, and (ii) effect from partial-volumed cerebrospinal fluid or interstitial fluid such as in edema. In this work, we developed a non-linear optic nerve registration algorithm for improved volume alignment in axial high resolution optic nerve dMRI. During eyes-closed dMRI data acquisition, optic nerve dMRI measurements by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with and without free water elimination (FWE), and by diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI), as well as optic nerve motion, were characterized in healthy adults at various locations along the posterior-to-anterior dimension. Optic nerve DTI results showed consistent trends in microstructural parametric measurements along the posterior-to-anterior direction of the entire intraorbital optic nerve, while the anterior portion of the intraorbital optic nerve exhibited the largest spatial displacement. Multi-compartmental dMRI modeling, such as DTI with FWE or DBSI, was less subject to spatially dependent biases in diffusivity and anisotropy measurements in the optic nerve which corresponded to similar spatial distributions of the estimated fraction of isotropic diffusion components. DBSI results derived from our clinically feasible (∼10 min) optic nerve dMRI protocol in this study are consistent with those from small animal studies, which provides the basis for evaluating the utility of multi-compartmental dMRI modeling in characterizing coexisting pathophysiology in human optic neuropathies.

N2  - From time to time it is thoughtful and productive to review a medical field and  reflect upon what are the major issues that need to be addressed and what is being done to do so. This review article is not meant to be all-inclusive but rather focuses on four evolving areas in the field of peripheral nerve disorders and treatments: (1) nerve surgery under ultrasound guidance using a new ultra-minimally invasive thread technique; (2) evolving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging techniques that are helping to both diagnose and treat a variety of peripheral nerve problems including entrapment neuropathies, traumatic nerve injuries, and masses arising from nerves; (3) promoting recovery after nerve injury using electrical stimulation; and (4) developing animal models to reproduce a severe nerve injury (neurotmetic grade in continuity) that requires a surgical intervention and repair. In each area we first describe the current challenges and then discuss new and emerging techniques and approaches. It is our hope that this article will bring added attention and resources to help better address peripheral nerve problems that remain a challenge for both patients and physicians.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Identify sonographic features of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve  (LFCN) in meralgia paresthetica (MP) and report therapeutic outcomes in sonographically confirmed cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 50 patients with clinically suspected MP and 20 controls. Ultrasounds were reviewed for characteristics of the LFCN and compared between groups. When available, MRIs were reviewed. In cases of sonographically pathologic LFCN, subsequent therapeutic interventions were recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-five of the suspected MP cases (70%) had ultrasound findings suggestive of MP, 10 (20%) were negative, and in 5 (10%) the LFCN was not seen. Sonographic findings in positive cases included nerve enlargement in all cases (mean cross-sectional area 9 mm(2) (standard deviation (SD) ± 5.59) versus 4 mm(2) (SD ± 2.31) and 3 mm(2) (SD ± 2.31) in negative cases and normal controls, respectively; p < 0.01), nerve hypoechogenicity (30 of 35 cases, 86%), and focal lesion (7 of 35 cases, 20%). Sixteen ultrasounds positive for MP had MRIs with only 4 (25%) reporting a concordant LFCN abnormality (enlargement or T2 hyperintensity). Twenty-five of the 35 (71%) patients with positive sonographic findings for MP had a US-guided LFCN block (local anesthetic ± corticosteroid), with 24 of 25 (96%) patients reporting immediate symptomatic improvement. Eighteen of 35 (51%) underwent LFCN neurectomy or neurolysis, all of whom experienced symptomatic improvement. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound is a useful modality for LFCN assessment in clinically suspected MP and is more sensitive for abnormalities than MRI. Nearly all patients who received perineural analgesia and/or neurectomy or neurolysis had symptomatic improvement.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess fractional anisotropy (FA) of sciatic nerve roots within the  pelvis by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients suffering from sciatica with inconclusive lumbar MRI. METHODS: This IRB-approved prospective study included 32 consecutive subjects (11 males and 21 females; mean age 32.2 years) between September 2019 and February 2020. All patients underwent DTI (TR/TE 5800/97 ms; b = 1000; slice thickness 3,5 mm; directions = 20) on a 1.5 T scanner (Siemens Aera). Seventeen patients were symptomatic, whereas 15 patients served as control group. DTI data were analyzed by two radiologists (25 and 11 years of experience, respectively) blinded to clinical data. Each radiologist placed two ROIs on the nerve roots at three different levels. Diagnostic accuracy values of FA numbers were calculated by using receiver operator curves (ROC) and relative area under the curve (AUC), by using clinical findings as standard of reference. Inter-observer agreement was calculated with k-statistics. Paired T-test and Mann-Whitney test were used for comparison accordingly to data distribution. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among the 17 symptomatic patients, FA values were significantly lower in the affected side at all levels (p < 0.05). The FA ratio (FA affected side/FA unaffected side) of symptomatic patients was significantly lower compared to control group at level 1 (p = 0.0005) and level 2 (p = 0.0006). Using a threshold of 0.90 for level 1 and 0.73 for level 2, 76 % and 71 % sensitivity and 100 % and 87 % specificity were achieved, respectively. CONCLUSION: DTI can quantitatively demonstrate sciatic nerve roots impairment within the pelvis.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aims to provide normal reference values for quantitative  parameters for brachial and lumbosacral plexi on multimodal MRI. In addition, the parameter variations between the left and right sides, the individual nerve groups, genders and age groups were also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multimodal MRI was evaluated in 163 healthy subjects, who were randomly divided into three groups: brachial plexus, lumbosacral plexus and diffusion tensor imaging groups. Nerve diameters, contrast ratios, T2 nerve-muscle signal ratios (nT2), fractional anisotropy (FA) values and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were measured in both plexi. Parametric tests and Pearson correlation for normally distributed data, and non-parametric tests and Spearman correlation for non-normally distributed data were used. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in parameters between the left and right sides. The diameters of the C7, L4-S1, sciatic, and femoral nerve roots were larger in men than in women (P < 0.05). The nT2 in the brachial and lumbosacral plexi and the contrast ratio in the lumbosacral plexus were significantly higher in the elderly. The diameter of the S1 nerve root was smaller in the elderly. There were no significant differences between the individual nerve groups in contrast ratios and in brachial plexus nT2. A gradual increase in the nT2 from the top to the bottom was observed in the L4-S1 nerve roots (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides multi-parameter normative data for the brachial and lumbosacral plexi while considering differences between the two sides, the individual nerves, genders, and the ages.

N2  - Peripheral nerves can be affected by a variety of benign and malignant tumour and  tumour-like lesions. Besides clinical evaluation and electrophysiologic studies, MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of these soft tissue tumours. Conventional MR sequences, however, can fail to assess the histologic features of the lesions. Moreover, the precise topographical relationship between the peripheral nerve and the tumor must be delineated preoperatively for complete tumour resection minimizing nerve damage. Using Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography, it is possible to obtain functional information on tumour and nerve structures, allowing the assess anatomy, function and biological features. In this article, we review the technical aspects and clinical application of DTI for the evaluation of peripheral nerve tumours.

N2  - Background The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying painful symptoms in diabetic  polyneuropathy (DPN) are poorly understood. They may be associated with MRI characteristics, which have not yet been investigated. Purpose To investigate correlations between nerve structure, load and spatial distribution of nerve lesions, and pain in patients with DPN. Materials and Methods In this prospective single-center cross-sectional study, participants with type 1 or 2 diabetes volunteered between June 2015 and March 2018. Participants underwent 3-T MR neurography of the sciatic nerve with a T2-weighed fat-suppressed sequence, which was preceded by clinical and electrophysiologic tests. For group comparisons, analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed depending on Gaussian or non-Gaussian distribution of data. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for correlation analysis. Results A total of 131 participants (mean age, 62 years ± 11 [standard deviation]; 82 men) with either type 1 (n = 45) or type 2 (n = 86) diabetes were evaluated with painful (n = 64), painless (n = 37), or no (n = 30) DPN. Participants who had painful diabetic neuropathy had a higher percentage of nerve lesions in the full nerve volume (15.2% ± 1.6) than did participants with nonpainful DPN (10.4% ± 1.7, P = .03) or no DPN (8.3% ± 1.7; P < .001). The amount and extension of T2-weighted hyperintense nerve lesions correlated positively with the neuropathy disability score (r = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21, 0.52; r = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.52, respectively) and the neuropathy symptom score (r = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.55; r = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.49, respectively). Negative correlations were found for the tibial nerve conduction velocity (r = -0.23; 95% CI: -0.44, -0.01; r = -0.37; 95% CI: -0.55, -0.15, respectively). The cross-sectional area of the nerve was positively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.36). Negative correlations were found for the tibial nerve conduction velocity (r = -0.24; 95% CI: -0.45, -0.01). Conclusion The amount and extension of T2-weighted hyperintense fascicular nerve lesions were greater in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy than in those with painless diabetic neuropathy. These results suggest that proximal fascicular damage is associated with the evolution of painful sensory symptoms in diabetic polyneuropathy. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine normative morphological and functional magnetic resonance (MR)  neurography values in children and adolescents in correlation to demographic determinants. METHODS: In this study 29 healthy underage subjects (mean age 13.9 years, range 10-17 years) were examined using a standardized MR neurography protocol of the lumbosacral plexus and the right lower extremity at 3 T. Volumes of the dorsal root ganglia L3-S2, cross-sectional area of the sciatic and tibial nerves, as well as T2-weighted contrast nerve-muscle ratio and quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) values of the sciatic nerve were obtained and correlated with the demographic parameters sex, age, height and weight. RESULTS: While all obtained morphological and functional MR neurography values did not differ between male and female sex, dorsal root ganglia volume, sciatic and tibial nerve cross-sectional area correlated positively with age, height, and weight. The T2-weighted signal of the sciatic nerve was independent of demographic determinants. Negative correlation was found for fractional anisotropy (FA) with age, height, and weight, whereas radial diffusivity (RD) showed a positive correlation only with age. Mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) revealed no correlation with demographic determinants. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that selection of sex-matched controls for further studies assessing peripheral nerve pathologies in underage patients may not be necessary; however, control subjects should be adapted to age, height, and weight of the patient population, especially if assessing dorsal root ganglia volume, nerve cross-sectional area and DTI.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established imaging modality which is  used in all districts of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems. More recently, initial studies have applied multiparametric MRI to evaluate quantitatively different aspects of musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve diseases, thus providing not only images but also numbers and clinical data. Besides (1)H and (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a relatively new MRI-based technique relying on principles of DWI, which has traditionally been used mainly for evaluating the central nervous system to track fibre course. In the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems, DTI has been mostly used in experimental settings, with still few indications in clinical practice. In this review, we describe the potential use of DTI to evaluate different musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve conditions, emphasising the translational aspects of this technique from the experimental to the clinical setting.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the development of morphologic and  diffusion tensor imaging sequences of peripheral nerves at 7 T, using carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as a model system of focal nerve injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Morphologic images were acquired at 7 T using a balanced steady-state free precession sequence. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed using single-shot echo-planar imaging and readout-segmented echo-planar imaging sequences. Different acquisition and postprocessing methods were compared to describe the optimal analysis pipeline. Magnetic resonance imaging parameters including cross-sectional areas, signal intensity, fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as mean, axial, and radial diffusivity were compared between patients with CTS (n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 6) using analyses of covariance corrected for age (significance set at P < 0.05). Pearson correlations with Bonferroni correction were used to determine association of magnetic resonance imaging parameters with clinical measures (significance set at P < 0.01). RESULTS: The 7 T acquisitions with high in-plane resolution (0.2 × 0.2mm) afforded detailed morphologic resolution of peripheral nerve fascicles. For diffusion tensor imaging, single-shot echo-planar imaging was more efficient than readout-segmented echo-planar imaging in terms of signal-to-noise ratio per unit scan time. Distortion artifacts were pronounced, but could be corrected during postprocessing. Registration of FA maps to the morphologic images was successful. The developed imaging and analysis pipeline identified lower median nerve FA (pisiform bone, 0.37 [SD 0.10]) and higher radial diffusivity (1.08 [0.20]) in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (0.53 [0.06] and 0.78 [0.11], respectively, P < 0.047). Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity strongly correlated with patients' symptoms (r = -0.866 and 0.866, respectively, P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the feasibility of morphologic and diffusion peripheral nerve imaging at 7 T. Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity were found to be correlates of symptom severity.

N2  - Traumatic conditions of peripheral nerves and plexus have been classically evaluated  by morphological imaging techniques and electrophysiological tests. New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies based on 3D fat-suppressed techniques are providing high accuracy for peripheral nerve injury evaluation from a qualitative point of view. However, these techniques do not provide quantitative information. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are functional MRI techniques that are able to evaluate and quantify the movement of water molecules within different biological structures. These techniques have been successfully applied in other anatomical areas, especially in the assessment of central nervous system, and now are being imported, with promising results for peripheral nerve and plexus evaluation. DWI and DTI allow performing a qualitative and quantitative peripheral nerve analysis, providing valuable pathophysiological information about functional integrity of these structures. In the field of trauma and peripheral nerve or plexus injury, several derived parameters from DWI and DTI studies such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or fractional anisotropy (FA) among others, can be used as potential biomarkers of neural damage providing information about fiber organization, axonal flow or myelin integrity. A proper knowledge of physical basis of these techniques and their limitations is important for an optimal interpretation of the imaging findings and derived data. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the potential applications of DWI and DTI neurographic studies is performed with a focus on traumatic conditions, including main nerve entrapment syndromes in both peripheral nerves and brachial or lumbar plexus.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used for visualizing  trigeminal nerves in trigeminal neuralgia. OBJECTIVE: To assess atrophy and diffusion abnormalities of affected trigeminal nerves in trigeminal neuralgia with 7-T MRI. METHODS: In this prospective study, 14 patients (mean age 49 years; range 31-64 years) with trigeminal neuralgia underwent 7-T MRI. We measured trigeminal nerve volumes along their course through the pontocerebellar cistern. We also evaluated fractional anisotropy (FA) and quantitative anisotropy (QA) values within cisternal segment and pontine nuclei of the affected-side and unaffected-side trigeminal nerves, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Associations between DTI metrics and Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scores were examined. RESULTS: The volumes were significantly smaller for the affected trigeminal nerves (33.83 ± 23.12 mm3) than for the unaffected ones (47.76 ± 32.48 mm3; p = 0.008). Cisternal segment FA and QA values were significantly lower in affected trigeminal nerves than in unaffected ones. However, DTI measurements in the pontine nuclei revealed no significant differences between affected-side and unaffected-side trigeminal nerves. No DTI metrics significantly correlated with BNI pain scores. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that 7-T MRI allows identifications of atrophy and diffusion abnormalities of trigeminal nerves in trigeminal neuralgia.

N2  - AIM: The aim of our study was to determine whether the diffusion properties of the  auditory pathways alter between patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and the healthy subjects. DTI can well demonstrate FA and ADC changes in auditory tracts and it may be a guide to identify the candidates for hearing loss among NF1 children. METHODS: The study population consisted of 43 patients with NF1 and 21 healthy controls. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to measure apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values from lemniscus lateralis, colliculus inferior, corpus geniculatum mediale and Heschl's gyrus. The results were compared with those of the control group. RESULTS: The ADC values of lateral lemniscus, colliculus inferior and corpus geniculatum mediale were significantly higher in NF1 compared to those of the control group. On the other hand, decreased FA values were observed in lateral lemniscus and colliculus inferior in patients with NF1. CONCLUSION: The increase in ADC and reduction in FA in the auditory pathways of patients with NF1 may suggest microstructural alterations, such as a decrease in the number of axons, edema or inflammation in the auditory tracts.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is characterized by facial pain that may be  sudden, intense, and recurrent. Neurosurgical interventions, such as radiofrequency rhizotomy, can relieve TN pain, but their mechanisms and effects are unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the microstructural tissue changes of the trigeminal nerve (TGN) in patients with TN after they underwent radiofrequency rhizotomy. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with TN were recruited, and diffusion tensor imaging was obtained before and two weeks after radiofrequency rhizotomy. By manually selecting the cisternal segment of the TGN, we measured the volume of the TGN, fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). The TGN volume and mean value of the DTI metrics of the post-rhizotomy lesion side were compared with those of the normal side and those of the pre-rhizotomy lesion side, and they were correlated to the post-rhizotomy visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores after a one-year follow-up. RESULTS: The alterations before and after rhizotomy showed a significantly increased TGN volume and FA, and a decreased ADC, AD, and RD. The post-rhizotomy lesion side showed a significantly decreased TGN volume, FA, and AD compared with the normal side; however, no significant difference in the ADC and RD were found between the groups. The TGN volume was significantly higher in the non-responders than in the responders (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Our results may reflect that the effects of radiofrequency rhizotomy in TN patients include axonal damage with perineural edema and that prolonged swelling associated with recurrence might be predicted by MRI images. Further studies are necessary to understand how DTI metrics can quantitatively represent the pathophysiology of TN and to examine the application of DTI in the treatment of TN.

N2  - Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging is an emerging magnetic resonance (MR) imaging  technique for evaluating the microstructure of well-organized biologic tissues such as muscles and nerves. DT imaging provides information about tissue microstructure by producing three-dimensional maps of water molecule movements. The two main parameters of measurement at DT imaging, fractional anisotropy and the apparent diffusion coefficient, allow quantitation of architectural changes occurring in tissue. These parameters are modified in the presence of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, cervical spine trauma, carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar nerve compression, peripheral nerve tumors, and muscle ischemia. Their alteration may be observed at DT imaging even when no abnormality is seen at conventional MR imaging, a fact that suggests that DT imaging allows the detection of abnormalities at an earlier stage of injury. Experimental studies in animals have shown that DT imaging consistently allows identification of pathophysiologic alterations in tissue that correlate with histologic findings. Tractographic images accurately depict both normal and abnormal diffusion in anatomic structures such as the thigh and pelvic muscles, cervical spine, and lumbar nerves. Patients with chronic diseases also may benefit from follow-up evaluation with DT imaging, although DT imaging sequences must be further adapted to improve the evaluation of specific anatomic regions by reducing artifacts, optimizing spatial resolution, and minimizing acquisition time. Given its proven potential for use in identifying abnormalities that are otherwise identifiable only with electrophysiologic and histopathologic studies, and with future technical improvements, DT imaging could soon become a standard method for early diagnosis, management, and follow-up of disease in the spine, muscles, and peripheral nerves.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Lowering serum cholesterol levels is a well-established treatment for  dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, nerve lesions in patients with T2D increase with lower serum cholesterol levels, suggesting that lowering serum cholesterol levels is associated with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in patients with T2D. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is an association between serum cholesterol levels and peripheral nerve lesions in patients with T2D with and without DPN. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study was performed from June 1, 2015, to March 31, 2018. Observers were blinded to clinical data. A total of 256 participants were approached, of whom 156 were excluded. A total of 100 participants consented to undergo magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg at the Department of Neuroradiology and clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic assessment at the Department of Endocrinology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. EXPOSURES: Quantification of the nerve's diameter and lipid equivalent lesion (LEL) load with a subsequent analysis of all acquired clinical and serologic data with use of 3.0-T magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg with 3-dimensional reconstruction of the sciatic nerve. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was lesion load and extension. Secondary outcomes were clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic findings. RESULTS: A total of 100 participants with T2D (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [0.9] years; 68 [68.0%] male) participated in the study. The LEL load correlated positively with the nerve's mean cross-sectional area (r = 0.44; P < .001) and the maximum length of a lesion (r = 0.71; P < .001). The LEL load was negatively associated with total serum cholesterol level (r = -0.41; P < .001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = -0.30; P = .006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = -0.33; P = .003), nerve conduction velocities of the tibial (r = -0.33; P = .01) and peroneal (r = -0.51; P < .001) nerves, and nerve conduction amplitudes of the tibial (r = -0.31; P = .02) and peroneal (r = -0.28; P = .03) nerves. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that lowering serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D and DPN is associated with a higher amount of nerve lesions and declining nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes. These findings may be relevant to emerging therapies that promote an aggressive lowering of serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D.

N2  - Electroacupuncture (EA) is an adjuvant therapy for peripheral nerve injury (PNI).  Both peripheral and central alterations contribute to the rehabilitation process. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the diffusion plasticity of afferent and efferent pathways caused by EA in model of peripheral nerve injury and reparation. Twenty-four rats were divided into three groups: normal group, model group and intervention group. Rats of the model group and the intervention group underwent sciatic nerve transection and anastomosis. EA intervention was performed on the intervention group at ST-36 and GB-30 for three months. Gait assessment and DTI were conducted at days post-operative (DPO) 30, 60 and 90. We selected corticospinal tract, spinothalamic tract and internal capsule as regions of interest and analyzed diffusion metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). FA values and RD values displayed significant differences or obvious tendency while AD values maintained a stable level. RD values displayed better indicative performance than FA in internal capsule. The intervention group presented significant correlation between RD values and Regularity Index (RI) during the intervention period. The effect of EA on peripheral nerve injury repairing rats appeared to be accelerated recovery process of sensory and motor neural pathway. We proposed that RD was a potential in vivo indicator for structural plasticity caused by EA and PNI.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the optic nerve is  affected by thyroid eye disease (TED) before the development of dysthyroid optic neuropathy with diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Twenty TED patients and 20 controls were included. The mean, axial, and radial diffusivities and fractional anisotropy (FA) value were measured at the optic nerves in DTI. Extraocular muscle diameters were measured on computed tomography. The diffusivities and FA of the optic nerves were compared between TED and controls and between active and inactive stages of TED. The correlations between these DTI parameters and the clinical features were determined. RESULTS: The mean, axial, and radial diffusivities were lower in TED compared with the controls (P < 0.05). In contrast, FA was higher in TED (P = 0.001). Radial diffusivity was lower in the active stage of TED than the inactive stage (P = 0.035). The FA was higher in the TED group than in the control group (P = 0.021) and was positively correlated with clinical activity score (r = 0.364, P = 0.021), modified NOSPECS score (r = 0.469, P = 0.002), and extraocular muscle thickness (r = 0.325, P = 0.041) in the TED group. Radial diffusivity was negatively correlated with modified NOSPECS score (r = -0.384, P = 0.014), and axial diffusivity was positively correlated with exophthalmos degree (r = 0.363, P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The diffusivities and FA reflected changes in the optic nerve before dysthyroid optic neuropathy in TED. The FA, in particular, reflected TED activity and severity.

N2  - The stress system provides integration of both neurochemical and somatic physiologic  functions within organisms as an adaptive mechanism to changing environmental conditions throughout evolution. In mammals and primates the complexity and sophistication of these systems have surpassed other species in triaging neurochemical and physiologic signaling to maximize chances of survival. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and its related peptides and receptors have been identified over the last three decades and are fundamental molecular initiators of the stress response. They are crucial in the top down regulatory cascade over a myriad of neurochemical, neuroendocrine and sympathetic nervous system events. From neuroscience, we've seen that stress activation impacts behavior, endocrine and somatic physiology and influences neurochemical events that one can capture in real time with current imaging technologies. To delineate these effects one can demonstrate how the CRH neuronal networks infiltrate critical cognitive, emotive and autonomic regions of the central nervous system (CNS) with somatic effects. Abundant preclinical and clinical studies show inter-regulatory actions of CRH with multiple neurotransmitters/peptides. Stress, both acute and chronic has epigenetic effects which magnify genetic susceptibilities to alter neurochemistry; stress system activation can add critical variables in design and interpretation of basic and clinical neuroscience and related research. This review will attempt to provide an overview of the spectrum of known functions and speculative actions of CRH and stress responses in light of imaging technology and its interpretation. Metabolic and neuroreceptor positron emission/single photon tomography (PET/SPECT), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), anatomic MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (pMRS) are technologies that can delineate basic mechanisms of neurophysiology and pharmacology. Stress modulates the myriad of neurochemical and networks within and controlled through the central and peripheral nervous system and the effects of stress activation on imaging will be highlighted.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To explore whether texture features using T1-weighted images correlate  with fat fraction, and whether they differ between Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease patients and volunteers. METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the requirement for informed consent was waived; data of eighteen CMT patients and eighteen healthy volunteers from a previous study was used. Texture features of the muscles including mean, standard deviation (SD), skewness, kurtosis, and entropy of the signal intensity were derived from T1-weighted images. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between texture features and fat fraction measured by 3D multiple gradient echo Dixon-based sequence. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the texture features between CMT patients and volunteers. Intraobserver and interobserver agreements for the texture features were assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The SD (ρ = 0.256, p < 0.001) and entropy (ρ = 0.263, p < 0.001) were significantly and positively correlated with fat fraction; skewness (ρ = - 0.110, p = 0.027) and kurtosis (ρ = - 0.149, p = 0.003) were significantly and inversely correlated with fat fraction. The CMT patients showed a significantly higher SD (63.45 vs. 49.26; p < 0.001), skewness (1.06 vs. 0.56; p < 0.001), kurtosis (4.00 vs. 1.81; p < 0.001), and entropy (3.20 vs. 3.02; p < 0.001) than did the volunteers. Intraobserver and interobserver agreements were almost perfect for mean, SD, and entropy. CONCLUSIONS: Texture features using T1-weighted images correlated with fat fraction and differed between CMT patients and volunteers. KEY POINTS: • Standard deviation and entropy of muscles derived from T1-weighted images were significantly and positively correlated with the muscle fat fraction. • Mean, standard deviation, and entropy were considered highly reliable in muscle analyses. • Texture features may have the potential to diagnose early stage of intramuscular fatty infiltration.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance  neurography (DW-MRN) in the visualisation of extremity nerves in the wrist and palm. METHODS: Thirty-two volunteers and 21 patients underwent imaging of the wrist and palm on a 3-T MR scanner. In all subjects, two radiologists evaluated the image quality on DW-MRN using a four-point grading scale. Kappa statistics were obtained for inter-observer performance. In volunteers, the chi-squared test was used to assess the differences in nerve visualisation on DW-MRN and axial fat-suppressed proton density weighted imaging (FS-PDWI). RESULTS: In volunteers, the mean image quality scores for the median nerve (MN) and ulnar nerve (UN) were 3.71 ± 0.46 and 3.23 ± 0.67 for observer 1, and 3.70 ± 0.46 and 3.22 ± 0.71 for observer 2, respectively. The inter-observer agreement was excellent (k = 0.843) and good (k = 0.788), respectively. DW-MRN provided significantly improved visualisations of the second and the third common palmar digital nerves and three branches of UN compared with FS-PDWI (P < 0.05). In patients, the mean image quality scores for the two observers were 3.24 ± 0.62 and 3.10 ± 0.83, inter-observer performance was excellent (k = 0.842). CONCLUSIONS: DW-MRN is feasible for improved visualisation of extremity nerves and their lesions in the wrist and palm with adequate image quality, thereby providing a supplementary method to conventional MR imaging. KEY POINTS: • DW-MRN provides adequate image quality for wrist and palm neurography • DW-MRN performs similarly to FS-PDWI in nerve visualisation at the wrist • DW-MRN provides improved visualisation of small nerves in the palm • DW-MRN serves as a supplementary method to evaluate peripheral neuropathies.

N2  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 1. Foot infections in patients with diabetes cause substantial  morbidity and frequent visits to health care professionals and may lead to amputation of a lower extremity. 2. Diabetic foot infections require attention to local (foot) and systemic (metabolic) issues and coordinated management, preferably by a multidisciplinary foot-care team (A-II). The team managing these infections should include, or have ready access to, an infectious diseases specialist or a medical microbiologist (B-II). 3. The major predisposing factor to these infections is foot ulceration, which is usually related to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral vascular disease and various immunological disturbances play a secondary role. 4. Aerobic Gram-positive cocci (especially Staphylococcus aureus) are the predominant pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have chronic wounds or who have recently received antibiotic therapy may also be infected with Gram-negative rods, and those with foot ischemia or gangrene may have obligate anaerobic pathogens. 5. Wound infections must be diagnosed clinically on the basis of local (and occasionally systemic) signs and symptoms of inflammation. Laboratory (including microbiological) investigations are of limited use for diagnosing infection, except in cases of osteomyelitis (B-II). 6. Send appropriately obtained specimens for culture before starting empirical antibiotic therapy in all cases of infection, except perhaps those that are mild and previously untreated (B-III). Tissue specimens obtained by biopsy, ulcer curettage, or aspiration are preferable to wound swab specimens (A-I). 7. Imaging studies may help diagnose or better define deep, soft-tissue purulent collections and are usually needed to detect pathological findings in bone. Plain radiography may be adequate in many cases, but MRI (in preference to isotope scanning) is more sensitive and specific, especially for detection of soft-tissue lesions (A-I). 8. Infections should be categorized by their severity on the basis of readily assessable clinical and laboratory features (B-II). Most important among these are the specific tissues involved, the adequacy of arterial perfusion, and the presence of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability. Categorization helps determine the degree of risk to the patient and the limb and, thus, the urgency and venue of management. 9. Available evidence does not support treating clinically uninfected ulcers with antibiotic therapy (D-III). Antibiotic therapy is necessary for virtually all infected wounds, but it is often insufficient without appropriate wound care. 10. Select an empirical antibiotic regimen on the basis of the severity of the infection and the likely etiologic agent(s) (B-II). Therapy aimed solely at aerobic Gram-positive cocci may be sufficient for mild-to-moderate infections in patients who have not recently received antibiotic therapy (A-II). Broad-spectrum empirical therapy is not routinely required but is indicated for severe infections, pending culture results and antibiotic susceptibility data (B-III). Take into consideration any recent antibiotic therapy and local antibiotic susceptibility data, especially the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms. Definitive therapy should be based on both the culture results and susceptibility data and the clinical response to the empirical regimen (C-III). 11. There is only limited evidence with which to make informed choices among the various topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotic agents. Virtually all severe and some moderate infections require parenteral therapy, at least initially (C-III). Highly bioavailable oral antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections, including some cases of osteomyelitis (A-II). Topical therapy may be used for some mild superficial infections (B-I). 12. Continue antibiotic therapy until there is evidence that the infection has resolved but not necessarily until a wound has healed. Suggestions for the duration of antibiotic therapy are as follows: for mild infections, 12 weeks usually suffices, but some require an additional 12 weeks; for moderate and severe infections, usually 24 weeks is sufficient, depending on the structures involved, the adequacy of debridement, the type of soft-tissue wound cover, and wound vascularity (A-II); and for osteomyelitis, generally at least 46 weeks is required, but a shorter duration is sufficient if the entire infected bone is removed, and probably a longer duration is needed if infected bone remains (B-II). 13. If an infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to 1 antibiotic courses, consider discontinuing all antimicrobials and, after a few days, obtaining optimal culture specimens (C-III). 14. Seek surgical consultation and, when needed, intervention for infections accompanied by a deep abscess, extensive bone or joint involvement, crepitus, substantial necrosis or gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis (A-II). Evaluating the limb's arterial supply and revascularizing when indicated are particularly important. Surgeons with experience and interest in the field should be recruited by the foot-care team, if possible. 15. Providing optimal wound care, in addition to appropriate antibiotic treatment of the infection, is crucial for healing (A-I). This includes proper wound cleansing, debridement of any callus and necrotic tissue, and, especially, off-loading of pressure. There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific wound dressing or any type of wound healing agents or products for infected foot wounds. 16. Patients with infected wounds require early and careful follow-up observation to ensure that the selected medical and surgical treatment regimens have been appropriate and effective (B-III). 17. Studies have not adequately defined the role of most adjunctive therapies for diabetic foot infections, but systematic reviews suggest that granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help prevent amputations (B-I). These treatments may be useful for severe infections or for those that have not adequately responded to therapy, despite correcting for all amenable local and systemic adverse factors. 18. Spread of infection to bone (osteitis or osteomyelitis) may be difficult to distinguish from noninfectious osteoarthropathy. Clinical examination and imaging tests may suffice, but bone biopsy is valuable for establishing the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, for defining the pathogenic organism(s), and for determining the antibiotic susceptibilities of such organisms (B-II). 19. Although this field has matured, further research is much needed. The committee especially recommends that adequately powered prospective studies be undertaken to elucidate and validate systems for classifying infection, diagnosing osteomyelitis, defining optimal antibiotic regimens in various situations, and clarifying the role of surgery in treating osteomyelitis (A-III).

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine dorsal root ganglia and the proximal nerve segments in female  patients with Fabry disease by functional and morphometric magnetic resonance neurography. METHODS: In this prospective multicenter study the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and proximal sciatic nerve were examined in ten female patients with Fabry disease by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3 T. Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3-S2, permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1 and the spinal nerve L5 as well as the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic nerve were compared to 16 gender-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Dorsal root ganglia were symmetrically enlarged by 54% (L3), 79% (L4), 60% (L5), 94% (S1), and 106% (S2) (p < 0.001). Additionally, permeability of the blood-tissue interface was decreased by 47% (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the peripheral zone of the dorsal root ganglia, where the cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons are located (p < 0.001). While spinal nerve permeability showed no differences compared to healthy controls, proximal sciatic nerve cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6% (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Although heterozygous, Fabry females show severe enlarged dorsal root ganglia with a concomitant dysfunctional perfusion, even in patients with minor disease progression and in patients who are not considered for enzyme replacement therapy yet. Alterations in dorsal root ganglia volume and perfusion might serve as a very early in vivo marker for involvement of the peripheral nervous system in Fabry disease, even in patients with residual enzyme activity.

N2  - PURPOSE: Magnetostimulation, also known as peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), is  the dominant safety constraint in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the gradient magnetic fields that operate around 0.1-1 kHz, and for the homogeneous drive field in magnetic particle imaging (MPI) that operates around 10-150 kHz. Previous studies did not report correlations between anatomical measures and magnetostimulation thresholds for the gradient magnetic fields in MRI. In contrast, a strong linear correlation was shown between the thresholds and the inverse of body part size in MPI. Yet, the effects of other anatomical measures on the thresholds for the drive field remain unexplored. Here, we investigate the effects of fat percentage on magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range homogeneous magnetic fields such as the drive field in MPI, with the ultimate goal of predicting subject-specific thresholds based on simple anatomical measures. METHODS: Human subject experiments were performed on the upper arms of 10 healthy male subjects (age: 26 ± 2 yr) to determine magnetostimulation thresholds. Experiments were repeated three times for each subject, with brief resting periods between repetitions. Using a solenoidal magnetostimulation coil, a homogeneous magnetic field at 25 kHz with 100 ms pulse duration was applied at 4-s intervals, while the subject reported stimulation via a mouse click. To determine the thresholds, individual subject responses were fitted to a cumulative distribution function modeled by a sigmoid curve. Next, anatomical images of the upper arms of the subjects were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner. A two-point Dixon method was used to obtain separate images of water and fat tissues, from which several anatomical measures were derived: the effective outer radius of the upper arm, the effective inner radius (i.e., the muscle radius), and fat percentage. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the threshold and anatomical measures. This statistical analysis was repeated after factoring out the expected effects of body part size. An updated model for threshold prediction is provided, where in addition to scaling in proportion with the inverse of the outer radius, the threshold has an affine dependence on fat percentage. RESULTS: A strong linear correlation (r = 0.783, P < 0.008) was found between magnetostimulation threshold and fat percentage, and the correlation became stronger after factoring out the effects of outer radius (r = 0.839, P < 0.003). While considering body part size alone did not explain any significant variance in measured thresholds (P > 0.398), the updated model that also incorporates fat percentage yielded substantially improved threshold predictions with R2  = 0.654 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This work shows for the first time that fat percentage strongly correlates with magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range homogenous magnetic fields such as the drive field in MPI, and that the correlations get even stronger after factoring out the effects of body part size. These results have important practical implications for predicting subject-specific thresholds, which in turn can increase the performance of the drive field and improve image quality while remaining within the safety limits.

N2  - OBJECT Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) are uncommon but bear a significant  risk of malignancy. High-resolution MRI is the standard technique for characterizing PNSTs. However, planning the appropriate extent of resection and subsequent reconstructive strategies is highly dependent on the intraoperative findings because preoperative MRI evaluation can be insufficient. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) represents a recently developed advanced MRI technique that reveals the microstructure of tissues based on monitoring the random movement of water molecules. DTT has the potential to provide diagnostic insights beyond conventional MRI techniques due to its mapping of specific fibrillar nerve structures. Here, DTT was applied to evaluate PNSTs and to examine the usefulness of this method for the correct delineation of tumor and healthy nerve tissue and the value of this information in the preoperative planning of surgical interventions. METHODS In this prospective study, patients with the clinical symptoms of a PNST were investigated using DTT 3-Tesla MRI scans. Image data processing and tractography were performed using the FACT (fiber assessment by continuous tracking) algorithm and multiple-regions-of-interest approach. The surgical findings were then compared with the results of the DTT MRI scans. Preoperative fascicle visualization and the correlation with the intraoperative findings were graded. RESULTS In a 21-month period, 12 patients with PNSTs were investigated (7 female and 5 male patients with a mean age of 46.2 ± 19.2 years). All patients underwent surgical removal of the tumor. Schwannoma was the most common benign histopathological finding (n = 7), whereas 2 malignant lesions were detected. In 10 of 12 patients, good preoperative nerve fascicle visualization was achieved using DTT scans. In 9 of 10 patients with good preoperative fascicle visualization, good intraoperative correlation between the DTT scans and surgical anatomy was found. CONCLUSIONS DTT properly visualizes the peripheral nerve fascicles and their correct anatomical relation to PNST. DTT represents a promising new method for the preinterventional planning of nerve tumor resection.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The use of a biofabrication nerve scaffold, which mimics the nerve  microstructure, as an alternative for autologous nerve transplantation is a promising strategy for treating peripheral nerve defects. This study aimed to design a customized biofabrication scaffold model with the characteristics of human peripheral nerve fascicles. METHODS: We used Micro-MRI technique to obtain different nerve fascicles. A full-length 28 cm tibial nerve specimen was obtained and was divided into 14 two-centimetre nerve segments. 3D models of the nerve fascicles were obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction after image segmentation. The central line of the nerve fascicles was fitted, and the aggregation of nerve fascicles was analysed quantitatively. The nerve scaffold was designed by simulating the clinical nerve defect and extracting information from the acquired nerve fascicle data; the scaffold design was displayed by 3D printing to verify the accuracy of the model. RESULT: The microstructure of the sciatic nerve, tibial nerve, and common peroneal nerve in the nerve fascicles could be obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction. The number of cross fusions of tibial nerve fascicles from proximal end to distal end decreased gradually. By designing the nerve graft in accordance with the microstructure of the nerve fascicles, the 3D printed model demonstrated that the two ends of the nerve defect can be well matched. CONCLUSION: The microstructure of the nerve fascicles is complicated and changeable, and the spatial position of each nerve fascicle and the long segment of the nerve fascicle aggregation show great changes at different levels. Under the premise of the stability of the existing imaging techniques, a large number of scanning nerve samples can be used to set up a three-dimensional database of the peripheral nerve fascicle microstructure, integrating the gross imaging information, and provide a template for the design of the downstream nerve graft model.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The goal of surgery in case of a large vestibular schwannoma is complete  excision of tumor and preservation of facial nerve function. The identification and preservation of facial nerve is very difficult during surgery, particularly in case of large tumors. This prospective randomized study was conducted to find out the effectiveness of preoperative facial nerve diffusion tensor imaging tractography (DTI) to predict location of the nerve and preservation of facial nerve function in surgery for large vestibular schwannomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective randomized study, we recruited 100 patients with a large vestibular schwannoma(> 3cm). After initial scrutiny, 94 patients were randomized based on a computer generated chart. In group I, preoperative DTI was done and the operating surgeon was informed about the position of facial nerve preoperatively. In group II, DTI was not done. The facial nerve preservation rates and clinical outcome at follow up was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Out of 94 patients, there were 47 patients in group I (DTI group) and 47 patients in group II (Non DTI group). In DTI group, 40 patients were left for comparison after the exclusion criteria was applied. Preoperative DTI predicted that the facial nerve position was concordant with its intraoperative position in 39 patients (97.5% concordance). Facial nerve preservation rates were statistically significant in group I (DTI group) (P value = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The study establishes the role of preoperative DTI tractography for better facial nerve preservation in surgery for large vestibular schwannomas (>3 cm).

N2  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of a major complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus  (T1DM) and a leading cause of blindness. Evidence of animal study has shown that it is not only a microvasucular lesion of the eye, but also a neurodegeneration disease of the visual system. However, the in vivo imaging evidence of axonal degeneration in the diabetic optic nerve is scarce. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique has been proved to be an effective tool to track the integrity of the nerve fibers in the central nervous system. In this study, type 1 diabetes was induced by intraperitoneally injecting a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) into Sprague-Dawley rats. DTI combined with histological assessments was carried out on the optic nerve to clarify the microstructural alterations underlying DTI indices changes at 4 weeks (4 w), 8 weeks (8 w) and 12 weeks (12 w) after STZ induction. The retinal changes were analyzed by pathological evaluations at 4 weeks (4 w) and 12 weeks (12 w) after STZ induction. DTI results showed significantly decreased mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (Da) in diabetic optic nerve compared to controls at 12 w. Atrophy in diabetic nerves was monitored by high resolution T(2)-weighted images. Axonal degeneration without myelin loss of the optic nerve was confirmed by histological examination. Moreover, there are positive correlations between decreased diffusivities (MD and Da) in the optic nerve and reduced total axolemmal area. The diabetic rats showed intense glial activity since 4 w and thinning of the thickness in inner plexiform layer and nerve fiber layer at 12 w in the retina. In conclusion, DTI could in vivo monitor the progression of optic nerve degeneration in diabetes and the findings in our study would help supply axonal protection for DR in preclinical practice.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare diffusion tensor imaging using the local  look technique and sensitivity encoding for tractography of the periprostatic neurovascular bundle. We compared the surrounding tissues of the prostate in eight healthy volunteers. The results of tractography in terms of the numbers of fibers and the fractional anisotropy map were evaluated. Distortion was evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient between isotropic diffusion images created from diffusion tensor images and T2-weighted images. The number of lines in tractography was significantly greater in diffusion tensor imaging using the local look technique (p < 0.001). Although there was no difference in image distortion of the prostate between methods, an artifact appeared in the center of the diffusion tensor image using sensitivity encoding. In conclusion, diffusion tensor imaging using the local look technique was superior to that using sensitivity encoding for tractography of the periprostatic neurovascular bundle.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the fractional  anisotropy (FA) values of compressed nerves derived in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the corresponding clinical symptoms for quantitative and clinical evaluation in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy. METHODS: Thirty-six patients and ten volunteers participated in the study and measured with DTI. The resultant FA values for L5-S1 lumbar nerve roots were calculated at three sub-regions. Additionally, the DTI relevant tractography was also performed on L4-S1 nerve roots. Clinical symptoms were performed by Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scoring for each patient and volunteer. RESULTS: The FA values of the nerves at the symptomatic side were significantly lower than those at the asymptomatic side (p < 0.001). Diffusion tensor tractography distinctly showed abnormalities in the symptomatic nerve tracts. There was a significant correlation between JOA scores and the FA values of the compressed nerves at middle and distal sub-regions (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: The clinical symptoms associated robustly with the DTI derived FA values of the compressed nerves in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy. Therefore, the FA values can be a potential clinical tool to evaluate the nerve roots in lumbosacral radiculopathy quantitatively.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate if diffusion tensor imaging MR neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect  lesions of peripheral nerves in patients with type 1 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven type 1 diabetic patients with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 type 1 diabetic patients without polyneuropathy (nDPN), and 10 healthy controls (HC) were investigated with a 3T MRI scanner. Clinical examinations, nerve-conduction studies, and vibratory-perception thresholds determined the presence of DPN. DTI-MRN (voxel size: 1.4 × 1.4 × 3 mm(3) ; b-values: 0, 800 s/mm(2) ) covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions of the lower extremity (tibial nerve). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated and compared to T(2) -relaxometry and proton-spin density obtained from a multiecho turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated DTI reproducibility, repeatability, and diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: DTI-MRN could accurately discriminate between DPN, nDPN, and HC. The proximal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 0.37 ± 0.06; nDPN 0.47 ± 0.03; HC 0.49 ± 0.06; P < 0.01). In addition, distal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 0.31 ± 0.05; nDPN 0.41 ± 0.07; HC 0.43 ± 0.08; P < 0.01). Likewise, proximal ADC was highest in DPN (DPN 1.69 ± 0.25 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; nDPN 1.50 ± 0.06 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; HC 1.42 ± 0.12 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; P < 0.01) as was distal ADC (DPN 1.87 ± 0.45 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; nDPN 1.59 ± 0.19 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; HC 1.57 ± 0.26 × 10(-3) mm(2) /s; P = 0.09). The combined interclass-correlation (ICC) coefficient of DTI reproducibility and repeatability was high in the sciatic nerve (ICC: FA = 0.86; ADC = 0.85) and the tibial nerve (ICC: FA = 0.78; ADC = 0.66). T(2) -relaxometry and proton-spin-density did not enable detection of neuropathy. CONCLUSION: DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher ADC. These alterations are likely to reflect proximal and distal nerve fiber pathology. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2017;45:1125-1134.

N2  - PURPOSE:  Sporadic mononeuropathies without trauma or compression are challenging to  diagnose. Nerve ultrasound has recently proven its usefulness in the diagnosis of traumatic neuropathies, tumors and polyneuropathies. However, its role in mononeuropathies currently remains unclear. We describe ultrasonography follow-up results in 12 patients with suggested spontaneous, monophasic mononeuritis without signs of generalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Nerve conduction studies (NCS), ultrasonography of the affected nerves and the contralateral side, laboratory analysis, and if possible magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected nerves were established in all patients at onset. In one patient, additive nerve biopsy was performed. In all patients, ultrasonography was repeated after immunotherapy. RESULTS:  An infectious pathogen of neuritis was not found in any patient. All but one patient showed predominant axonal nerve damage in NCS, whereas ultrasonography and MRI revealed fascicular and/or overall cross-sectional area (CSA) enlargement or T2 hyperintensity of the affected nerve segments, suggesting an inflammatory background of the neuropathy. Most patients showed significant clinical amelioration of symptoms under treatment (75.0 %) and consequently a decrease in CSA/fascicle enlargement over time (77.8 %). CONCLUSION:  Ultrasonography and MRI of the nerves revealed enlargement in patients with mononeuropathy of axonal NCS pattern of unknown origin. Ultrasonography can facilitate the therapeutic decision for immunotherapy. Next to nerve trauma, nerve tumors and nerve entrapments, ultrasonography reliably shows nerve enlargement in the case of inflammation and therefore could further enrich neurophysiology. Nerve imaging might serve as a follow-up tool by observing a decrease in nerve enlargement and improved function.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Oblique sagittal MRI sequences, orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of  the brachial plexus, can reliably depict morphologic and signal abnormalities. However, nerve visualization may be obscured by ghosting artifact from periodic respiratory motion. Respiratory triggering (RT) with a thoracoabdominal bellows can reduce ghosting artifact, but it is not routinely used for brachial plexus MRI. Furthermore, the efficacy of prospective RT for brachial plexus imaging has not yet been reported. PURPOSE: To compare brachial plexus MRI sequences acquired with and without respiratory triggering. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. SUBJECTS: Five volunteers and 20 patients were included. Each subject was imaged with and without RT during the same session. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Proton density or T(2) -weighted Dixon fat suppressed sequences were obtained at 3.0T using receive-only 16-channel flexible array coils. ASSESSMENT: Three musculoskeletal radiologists blindly evaluated each sequence using subjective scoring criteria for ghosting artifact, nerve conspicuity, and diagnostic confidence. Nerve conspicuity scores at three distinct plexus levels were summed to calculate an overall image quality score. STATISTICAL TESTS: Marginal proportional odds logistic regression models were used to compare all scores between RT and non-RT. Gwet's agreement coefficient was used to assess interobserver and intraobserver reliability. RESULTS: Mean scan time per sequence increased from 4:25 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI], 4:02-4:49 min) with non-RT to 6:09 minutes (95% CI, 5:42-6:35 min) with RT. RT reduced ghosting artifact (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.09-0.46, P < 0.001), improved overall image quality (OR = 4.88, 95% CI: 2.18-10.95, P < 0.001), and increased diagnostic confidence (OR = 3.72, 95% CI: 1.61-8.63, P = 0.002) for all readers. Interobserver agreement for ghosting artifact and image quality was substantial to almost perfect (AC(2)  = 0.74-0.85). Interobserver agreement for all other scores was moderate to almost perfect (AC(2)  = 0.61-0.82). Intraobserver agreement was substantial to almost perfect for all parameters (AC(2)  = 0.76-1.0). DATA CONCLUSION: Prospective RT with bellows can effectively minimize ghosting artifact and improve image quality for brachial plexus MRI within clinically optimal acquisition times. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the ability of readout-segmented echo-planar  imaging (rs-EPI)-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing the microstructural change of extraocular muscles (EOMs) and optic nerves in patients with thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO) as well as in evaluating disease activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 35 TAO patients and 22 healthy controls (HCs) who underwent pre-treatment rs-EPI-based DTI. Mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, and RD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the medial and lateral EOMs and optic nerve for each orbit were calculated and compared between TAO and HC groups and between active and inactive TAO groups. Factors such as age, sex, disease duration, mediation, and smoking history between groups were also compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the predictive value of significant variables for disease activity. RESULTS: Disease duration was significantly shorter in active TAOs than in inactive ones (p < 0.001). TAO patients showed significantly lower FA and higher MD, AD, and RD than HCs for both medial and lateral EOMs (p < 0.001), but not the AD value of lateral EOMs (p = 0.619). Active patients had significantly higher FA, MD, and AD than inactive patients for medial EOMs (p < 0.005), whereas only FA differed significantly in the lateral EOMs (p = 0.018). The MD, AD, and RD of optic nerves were significantly lower in TAO patients than HCs (p < 0.05), except for FA (p = 0.129). Multivariate analysis showed that the MD of medial EOMs and disease duration were significant predictors for disease activity. The combination of these two parameters showed optimal diagnostic efficiency for disease activity (area under the curve, 0.855; sensitivity, 68.4%; specificity, 96.9%). CONCLUSION: rs-EPI-based DTI is promising in assessing microstructural changes of EOMs and optic nerves and can help to indicate the disease activity of TAO, especially through the MD of medial EOMs.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To detect and quantify lesions of the small-caliber sural nerve (SN) in  symptomatic and asymptomatic transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in correlation with electrophysiologic and histopathologic findings. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with TTR-FAP, 10 asymptomatic carriers of the mutated transthyretin gene (mutTTR), and 35 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were prospectively included in this cross-sectional case-control study. All participants underwent 3T MRN with high-structural resolution (fat-saturated, T2-weighted, and double-echo sequences). Total imaging time was ≈45 minutes per patient. Manual SN segmentation was performed from its origin at the sciatic nerve bifurcation to the lower leg with subsequent evaluation of quantitative microstructural and morphometric parameters. Additional time needed for postprocessing was ≈1.5 hours per participant. Detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic examinations were conducted in the TTR group. RESULTS: T2 signal and proton spin density (ρ) reliably differentiated between TTR-FAP (198.0 ± 13.3, 429.6 ± 15.25), mutTTR carriers (137.0 ± 16.9, p = 0.0009; 354.7 ± 21.64, p = 0.0029), and healthy controls (90.0 ± 3.4, 258.2 ± 9.10; p < 0.0001). Marked differences between mutTTR carriers and controls were found for T2 signal (p = 0.0065) and ρ (p < 0.0001). T2 relaxation time was higher in patients with TTR-FAP only (p = 0.015 vs mutTTR carriers, p = 0.0432 vs controls). SN caliber was higher in patients with TTR-FAP vs controls and in mutTTR carriers vs controls (p < 0.0001). Amyloid deposits were histopathologically detectable in 10 of 14 SN specimens. CONCLUSIONS: SN injury in TTR-FAP is detectable and quantifiable in vivo by MRN even in asymptomatic mutTTR carriers. Differences in SN T2 signal between controls and asymptomatic mutTTR carriers are derived mainly from an increase of ρ, which overcomes typical limitations of established diagnostic methods as a highly sensitive imaging biomarker for early detection of peripheral nerve lesions. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that MRN accurately identifies asymptomatic mutTTR carriers.

N2  - Peripheral nerves are a composite tissue consisting of neurovascular elements  packaged within a well-organized extracellular matrix. Their composition, size, and anatomy render nerves a challenging medical imaging target. In contrast to morphological MRI, which represents the predominant approach to nerve imaging, quantitative MRI sequences can provide information regarding tissue composition. Here, we applied standard clinical Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) and experimental three-dimensional (3D) ultrashort echo time (UTE) Cones sequences for quantitative nerve imaging including T(2) measurement with single-component analysis, T(2) * measurement with single-component and bi-component analyses, and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) analysis. We demonstrated the feasibility and the high quality of single-component T(2) *, bi-component T(2) *, and MTR approaches to analyze nerves imaged with clinically deployed 3D UTE Cones pulse sequences. For 24 single fascicles from eight nerves, we measured a mean single-component T(2) * of 22.6 ±8.9 ms, and a short T(2) * component (STC) with a mean T(2) * of 1.7 ±1.0 ms and a mean fraction of (6.74 ±4.31)% in bi-component analysis. For eight whole nerves, we measured a mean single-component T(2) * of 16.7 ±2.2 ms, and an STC with a mean T(2) * of 3.0 ±1.0 ms and a mean fraction of (15.56 ±7.07)% in bi-component analysis. For nine fascicles from three healthy nerves, we measured a mean MTR of (25.2 ±1.9)% for single fascicles and a mean MTR of (23.6 ±0.9)% for whole nerves. No statistically significant correlation was observed between any MRI parameter and routine histological outcomes, perhaps due to the small sample size and lack of apparent sample pathology. Overall, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of measuring quantitative MR outcomes ex vivo, which might reflect features of nerve structure and macromolecular content. These methods should be validated comprehensively on a larger and more diverse set of nerve samples, towards the interpretation of in vivo outcomes. These approaches have new and broad implications for the management of nerve disease, injury, and repair.

N2  - Diagnosis and management of peripheral nerve injury is complicated by the inability  to assess microstructural features of injured nerve fibers via clinical examination and electrophysiology. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to accurately detect nerve injury and regeneration in crush models of peripheral nerve injury, but no prior studies have been conducted on nerve transection, a surgical emergency that can lead to permanent weakness or paralysis. Acute sciatic nerve injuries were performed microsurgically to produce multiple grades of nerve transection in rats that were harvested 1 hour after surgery. High-resolution diffusion tensor images from ex vivo sciatic nerves were obtained using diffusion-weighted spin-echo acquisitions at 4.7 T. Fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced at the injury sites of transected rats compared with sham rats. Additionally, minor eigenvalues and radial diffusivity were profoundly elevated at all injury sites and were negatively correlated to the degree of injury. Diffusion tensor tractography showed discontinuities at all injury sites and significantly reduced continuous tract counts. These findings demonstrate that high-resolution DTI is a promising tool for acute diagnosis and grading of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study explores whether objective, quantitative radiomic biomarkers  derived from magnetic resonance (MR), positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT) may be useful in reliably distinguishing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN). METHODS: A registration and segmentation pipeline was established using a cohort of NF1 patients with histopathological diagnosis of PN or MPNST, and medical imaging of the PN including MR and PET-CT. The corrected MR datasets were registered to the corresponding PET-CT via landmark-based registration. PET standard-uptake value (SUV) thresholds were used to guide segmentation of volumes of interest: MPNST-associated PET-hot regions (SUV≥3.5) and PN-associated PET-elevated regions (2.0<SUV<3.5). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from the MR, PET, and CT data and compared for statistical differences. Intensity histogram features included (mean, media, maximum, variance, full width at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and skewness), while image texture was quantified using Law's texture energy measures, grey-level co-occurrence matrices, and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices. RESULTS: For each of the 20 NF1 subjects, a total of 320 features were extracted from the image data. Feature reduction and statistical testing identified 9 independent radiomic biomarkers from the MR data (4 intensity and 5 texture) and 4 PET (2 intensity and 2 texture) were different between the PET-hot versus PET-elevated volumes of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests imaging features can be used to distinguish malignancy in NF1-realted tumors, which could improve MPNST risk assessment and positively impact clinical management of NF1 patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence for the involvement of cerebrovascular  factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate retinal and optic nerve head perfusion in patients with AD using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and to analyze the correlations of quantitative OCTA metrics with AD pathology and vascular cerebral lesions in AD patients. METHODS: 36 eyes of 36 patients with AD (study group) and 38 eyes of 38 healthy subjects (control group) were prospectively included in this study. OCTA was performed using RTVue XR Avanti with AngioVue. In addition, patients underwent a detailed ophthalmological and neurological examination including Mini-Mental State Examination, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, and amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). RESULTS: The flow density in the superficial retinal OCT angiogram of the macula in the study group was significantly lower compared to the control group (p = 0.001). There was a significant correlation between the flow density in the superficial retinal OCT angiogram of the macula, as measured using OCTA, and the Fazekas scale (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.520; p = 0.003). There was no significant correlation between the Aβ or tau levels in the CSF and the flow density data. CONCLUSION: Patients with AD showed a reduced flow density in the radial peripapillary capillaries layer and in the superficial retinal OCT angiogram when compared with healthy controls. The reduced retinal flow density measured using OCTA is not specifically associated with AD pathology but is associated with the vascular cerebral lesions in AD.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The neurofibromatoses (NF) type 1 and 2 are hereditary tumor  predisposition syndromes caused by germline mutations in the NF1 and NF2 tumor suppressor genes. In NF1 and 2, peripheral nerve tumors occur regularly. For further characterizing nerve ultrasound was performed in patients with NF1 and 2. METHODS: Patients with established diagnosis of NF1 (n=27) and NF2 (n=10) were included. Ultrasound of peripheral nerves and cervical roots was performed during routine follow-up visits. Healthy volunteers were studied for comparison. RESULTS: In patients with NF1, median cross-sectional area (CSA) of most nerves was significantly increased compared to controls and to NF2 due to generalized plexiform tumors, which arose out of multiple fascicles in 23 of 27 patients (85%). These were often accompanied by cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas. In NF2, the overall aspect of peripheral nerves consisted of localized schwannomas (80%) and, apart from that, normal nerve segments. CONCLUSION: Nerve ultrasound is able to visualize different nerve pathologies in NF1 and NF2. It is a precise and inexpensive screening method for peripheral nerve manifestation in neurofibromatosis and should be considered as the first choice screening imaging modality for all peripheral nerves within reach of non-invasive ultrasound techniques. SIGNIFICANCE: Ultrasound patterns of peripheral nerve pathologies are described for the first time in a large cohort of patients with NF1 and NF2. It is a suitable screening tool and enables targeted MRI analysis.

N2  - Cross-sectional MRI has modest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing traumatic brachial  plexus root avulsions. Consequently, patients either undergo major exploratory surgery or months of surveillance to determine if and what nerve reconstruction is needed. This study aimed to develop a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol at 3 Tesla to visualize normal roots and identify traumatic root avulsions of the brachial plexus. Seven healthy adults and 12 adults with known (operatively explored) unilateral traumatic brachial plexus root avulsions were scanned. DTI was acquired using a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence at 3 Tesla. The brachial plexus was visualized by deterministic tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated for injured and avulsed roots in the lateral recesses of the vertebral foramen. Compared to healthy nerves roots, the FA of avulsed nerve roots was lower (mean difference 0.1 [95% CI 0.07, 0.13]; p < 0.001) and the MD was greater (mean difference 0.32 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s [95% CI 0.11, 0.53]; p < 0.001). Deterministic tractography reconstructed both normal roots and root avulsions of the brachial plexus; the negative-predictive value for at least one root avulsion was 100% (95% CI 78, 100). Therefore, DTI might help visualize both normal and injured roots of the brachial plexus aided by tractography. The precision of this technique and how it relates to neural microstructure will be further investigated in a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of patients with acute brachial plexus injuries.

N2  - PURPOSE: While standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are increasingly  employed in post-mortem (PM) examinations, more advanced techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) remain unexplored in forensic sciences. Therefore, we studied the temporal stability and reproducibility of DTI and fiber tractography (FT) in non-fixed PM subjects. In addition, we investigated the lumbosacral nerves with PMDTI and compared their tissue characteristics to in vivo findings. METHODS: MRI data were acquired on a 1.5T MRI scanner in seven PM subjects, consisting of six non-trauma deaths and one chronic trauma death, and in six living subjects. Inter-scan (within one session) and inter-session (between days) reproducibility of diffusion parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD), were evaluated for the lumbosacral nerves using Bland-Altman and Jones plots. Diffusion parameters in nerves L3-S2 were compared to living subjects using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Reproducibility of diffusion values of inter-scan 95% limits of agreement ranged from -0.058 to 0.062 for FA, and (-0.037 to 0.052)×10(-3)mm(2)/s for MD. For the inter-session this was -0.0423 to 0.0423, and (-0.0442 to 0.0442)×10(-3)mm(2)/s for FA, and MD, respectively. Although PM subjects showed approximately four-fold lower diffusivity values compared to living subjects, FT results were comparable. The chronic trauma case showed disorganization and asymmetry of the nerves. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that DTI was reproducible in characterizing nervous tissue properties and FT in reconstructing the architecture of lumbosacral nerves in PM subjects. We showed differences in diffusion values between PM and in vivo and showed the ability of PMDTI and FT to reconstruct nerve lesions in a chronic trauma case. We expect that PMDTI and FT may become valuable in identification and documentation of PM nerve trauma or pathologies in forensic sciences.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The development of a noninvasive, objective, and accurate method to  assess peripheral nerve disorders in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is of clinical significance. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to evaluate some peripheral nerve disorders. PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of DTI in evaluating the peripheral nerve disorders in patients with GBS. STUDY TYPE: Case control. SUBJECTS: Twenty GBS patients and 16 healthy volunteers. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T, T(1) WI-SE, T(2) WI-SPAIR, DTI; electrophysiology. ASSESSMENT: MRI data were analyzed by two radiologists blindly and independently. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusion coefficient (AD), and radial diffusion coefficient (RD) values of tibial nerve (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were recorded. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) and motor nerve conduction amplitude of TN and CPN were recorded. STATISTICAL TESTS: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), t-test, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC) analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The FA and AD values of TN and CPN in the GBS group were significantly lower and the ADC and RD values were higher than those in the controls (P <0.05). The AUC of the FA values (0.970 for TN and 0.927 for CPN) were higher than that of the ADC, AD, and RD values. FA and AD values were positively correlated and ADC, RD values were negatively correlated with MCV and motor nerve conduction amplitude, respectively (P <0.05). The correlations between FA value and electrophysiology parameters were the highest. DATA CONCLUSION: DTI quantitative parameters could evaluate the disorders of peripheral nerves in patients with GBS. A moderate correlation was observed between DTI and electrophysiology parameters.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is histological evidence of microstructural changes in the  zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve in migraineurs. This raises the possibility that altered trigeminal nerve properties contribute to migraine pathophysiology. Whilst it is not possible to explore the anatomy of small trigeminal nerve branches it is possible to explore the anatomy of the trigeminal root entry zone using magnetic resonance imaging in humans. The aim of this investigation is to assess the microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in vivo to determine if nerve alterations occur in individuals with episodic migraine. METHODS: In 39 migraineurs and 39 matched controls, T1-weighted anatomical images were used to calculate the volume (mm(3)) and maximal cross-sectional area of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone; diffusion tensor images were used to calculate fractional anisotropy, mean diffusion, axial diffusion and radial diffusion. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the left and right nerve of controls and migraineurs with respect to volume and not cross-sectional area. Migraineurs displayed reduced axial diffusion in the right nerve compared to the left nerve, and reduced fractional anisotropy in the left nerve compared to left controls. Furthermore, although there were no differences in mean diffusion or radial diffusion, regional analysis of the nerve revealed significantly greater radial diffusion in the middle and rostral portion of the left trigeminal nerve in migraineurs compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine pathophysiology is associated with microstructural abnormalities within the trigeminal nerve that are consistent with histological evidence of altered myelin and/or organization. These peripheral nerve changes may provide further insight into migraine pathophysiology and enable a greater understanding for targeted treatments of pain alleviation.

N2  - Due to the technical challenges of large-scale microscopy and analysis, to date only  limited knowledge has been made available about axon morphometry (diameter, shape, myelin thickness, volume fraction), thereby limiting our understanding of neuronal microstructure and slowing down research on neurodegenerative pathologies. This study addresses this knowledge gap by establishing a state-of-the-art acquisition and analysis framework for mapping axon morphometry, and providing the first comprehensive mapping of axon morphometry in the human spinal cord. We dissected, fixed and stained a human spinal cord with osmium tetroxide, and used a scanning electron microscope to image the entirety of 23 axial slices, covering C1 to L5 spinal levels. An automatic method based on deep learning was then used to segment each axon and myelin sheath to produce maps of axon morphometry. These maps were then registered to a standard spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) template. Between 500,000 (lumbar) and 1 million (cervical) myelinated axons were segmented at each level of this human spinal cord. Morphometric features show a large disparity between tracts, but high right-left symmetry. Our results suggest a modality-based organization of the dorsal column in the human, as it has been observed in the rat. The generated axon morphometry template is publicly available at https://osf.io/8k7jr/ and could be used as a reference for quantitative MRI studies. The proposed framework for axon morphometry mapping could be extended to other parts of the central or peripheral nervous system that exhibit coherently-oriented axons.

N2  - Clinical trial design in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains hampered by a  lack of reliable and sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. The present study evaluated peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a surrogate marker of axonal degeneration in ALS. Longitudinal studies were undertaken in 21 ALS patients studied at 0 and 3 months, and 19 patients at 0, 3 and 6 months, with results compared to 13 age-matched controls. Imaging metrics were correlated across a range of functional assessments including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R), lower limb muscle strength (Medical Research Council sum score, MRCSS-LL), compound muscle action potential amplitudes and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Fractional anisotropy was reduced at baseline in ALS patients in the tibial (p < 0.05), and peroneal nerve (p < 0.05). Fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity declined in the tibial nerve between baselines, 3- and 6-month scans (p < 0.01). From a functional perspective, ALSFRS-R correlated with fractional anisotropy values from tibial (R = 0.75, p < 0.001) and peroneal nerves (R = 0.52, p = 0.001). Similarly, peroneal nerve MUNE values correlated with fractional anisotropy values from the tibial (R = 0.48, p = 0.002) and peroneal nerve (R = 0.39, p = 0.01). There were correlations between the change in ALSFRS-R and tibial nerve axial diffusivity (R = 0.38, p = 0.02) and the change in MRCSS-LL and peroneal nerve fractional anisotropy (R = 0.44, p = 0.009). In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that some peripheral nerve DTI metrics are sensitive to axonal degeneration in ALS. Further, that DTI metrics correlated with measures of functional disability, strength and neurophysiological measures of lower motor neuron loss.

N2  - Sensory-motor integration models have been proposed aiming to explain how the brain  uses sensory information to guide and check the planning and execution of movements. Sensory neuronopathy (SN) is a peculiar disease characterized by exclusive, severe and widespread sensory loss. It is a valuable condition to investigate how sensory deafferentation impacts brain organization. We thus recruited patients with clinical and electrophysiological criteria for SN to perform structural and functional MRI analyses. We investigated volumetric changes in gray matter (GM) using anatomical images; the microstructure of WM within segmented regions of interest (ROI), via diffusion images; and brain activation related to a finger tapping task. All significant results were related to the long disease duration subgroup of patients. Structural analysis showed hypertrophy of the caudate nucleus, whereas the diffusion study identified reduction of fractional anisotropy values in ROIs located around the thalamus and the striatum. We also found differences regarding finger-tapping activation in the posterior parietal regions and in the medial areas of the cerebellum. Our results stress the role of the caudate nucleus over the other basal ganglia in the sensory-motor integration models, and suggest an inhibitory function of a recently discovered tract between the thalamus and the striatum. Overall, our findings confirm plasticity in the adult brain and open new avenues to design neurorehabilitation strategies.

N2  - Background: Ultrasound (US) measurement of cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median  nerve has emerged as a viable alternative to electromyography/nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCS) for diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The purpose of this study is to compare CSA of the median nerve between US and MRI using current MRI and US technology. The null hypothesis is there is no difference between US and MRI CSA measurements. Methods: The study design was an observational cohort, enrolling patients presenting to clinic with MRI of the wrist. Participants with clinical signs and symptoms of CTS were excluded. The CSA measurements of the median nerve on MRI T1-weighted axial images were performed by a hand fellow blinded to results of US measurements, and US measurement of median nerve CSA was performed by a hand fellowship trained surgeon blinded to results of the MRI measurements. Results were analyzed via percent error, Pearson correlation, and t tests. Results: Twenty participants were enrolled with mean age of 29.4 years. Four left wrists and 16 right wrists were measured. The US mean CSA of the median nerve was 6.8 mm(2) (±2.330 mm(2)). The MRI mean CSA of the median nerve was 6.8 mm(2) (±2.153 mm(2)), P = .442. Pearson correlation between modalities was 0.93, suggesting near-perfect correlation. Mean percent error was 8.8%. Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that US is an accurate method to measure CSA of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel inlet. The mean difference between US and MRI was unlikely to be clinically significant.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We present a clinical, electrophysiological, sonographical and magnetic  resonance neurography (MRN) study examining the complementary role of two neuroimaging methods of the peripheral nervous system for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Furthermore, we explore the significance of cross-sectional area (CSA) increase through correlations with MRN markers of nerve integrity. METHODS: A total of 108 nerve segments on the median, ulnar, radial, tibial and fibular nerve, as well as the lumbar and cervical plexus of 18 CIDP patients were examined with high-resonance nerve ultrasound (HRUS) and MRN additionally to the nerve conduction studies. RESULTS: We observed a fair degree of correlation of the CSA values for all nerves/nerve segments between the two methods, with a low random error in Bland-Altman analysis (bias = HRUS-CSA - MRN-CSA, -0.61 to -3.26 mm). CSA in HRUS correlated with the nerve T2-weighted (nT2) signal increase as well as with diffusion tensor imaging parameters such as fractional anisotropy, a marker of microstructural integrity. HRUS-CSA of the interscalene brachial plexus correlated significantly with the MRN-CSA and nT2 signal of the L5 and S1 roots of the lumbar plexus. CONCLUSIONS: HRUS allows for reliable CSA imaging of all peripheral nerves and the cervical plexus, and CSA correlates with markers of nerve integrity. Imaging of proximal segments as well as the estimation of nerve integrity require MRN as a complementary method.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent imaging modality for  soft tissues. Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging is an MRI technique that is sensitive to the bound protons of macromolecules and therefore can aid in the assessment of nerve damage. METHODS: Measurements of the MT ratio (MTR), which provides an index of the MT effects in tissues, were performed in the wrist and foot of 5 volunteers. RESULTS: The MTR of foot (interdigital) nerves (22.2 ± 2.1%) was smaller than that of the median nerve (41.1 ± 1.4%). No difference was observed between MTR in muscles adjacent to foot nerves (46.0 ± 1.5%) and muscles adjacent to the median nerve (44.2 ± 1.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the MTR of foot nerves. The difference of MTR between median and foot nerves indicates a difference in structure/composition. The MTR of peripheral nerves may serve as a biomarker of nerve damage, collagen integrity, and demyelination.

N2  - The assessment of human peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles by means of diffusion  tensor imaging and tractograpy has been a recent area of research. These techniques have been successfully applied in both volunteers and patients, providing non-invasively, quantitative microstructural parameters (mainly mean fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient) and offering a three-dimensional visualization tool of nerves and muscles fibers. DTI and tractography may reveal abnormalities that are beyond the resolution of conventional MR techniques and hence open the way to potential clinical applications. In this article, we will first summarize the current state of DTI and tractography in the evaluation of peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles as well as their potential future clinical applications. Then, we will address important technical considerations, which understanding is necessary to appropriately apply DTI and tractograhy, and in order to understand the current limitations of these innovative and promising techniques.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that a magnetic  resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can differentiate between crush and complete transection peripheral nerve injuries in a rat model ex vivo. DTI measures the directionally dependent effect of tissue barriers on the random diffusion of water molecules. In ordered tissues such as nerves, this information can be used to reconstruct the primary direction of diffusion along fiber tracts, which may provide information on fiber tract continuity after nerve injury and surgical repair. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with different degrees of partial transection of the sciatic nerve followed by immediate repair and euthanized after 1 week of recovery. Nerves were then harvested, fixed, and scanned with a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging to obtain DTIand fiber tractography in each sample. Additional behavioral (sciatic function index, foot fault asymmetry) and histological (Toluidine blue staining) assessments were performed for validation. RESULTS: Tractography yielded a visual representation of the degree of injury that correlated with behavioral and histological evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: DTI tractography is a noninvasive tool that can yield a visual representation of a partial nerve transection as early as 1 week after surgical repair.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The genetic component of multiple sclerosis (MS) is now set to 200  autosomal common variants. However, it is unclear how genetic knowledge be clinically used in the differential diagnosis between MS and other inflammatory conditions like adult-onset postinfectious neurological syndromes (PINS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether PINS and MS have a shared genetic background using an updated polygenic risk scores. METHODS: Eighty-eight PINS patients have been consecutively recruited between 1996 and 2016 at Mondino Foundation of Pavia, diagnosed according to clinical, MRI and CSF findings and followed-up for several years. Patients were typed using Illumina array, and genotypes imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. A weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) has been calculated based on autosomal MS risk loci derived from large-scale studies, and an HLA genetic burden (HLAGB) was also calculated on loci associated to MS. RESULTS: PINS occurred as an episode of myelitis in 44% of patients, encephalomyelitis in 44%, and encephalitis in remaining cases, with an involvement of peripheral nervous system in 41% of patients. Mean age of onset was 50.1 years, and female:male ratio was 1.4. Patients were followed-up for a mean of 7.2 years, and at last visit 55% had a low disability grade (mRS 0-1). Disease was monophasic in 67% of patients, relapsing in 18% and chronic-progressive in 15%. The wGRS of PINS cases was comparable to 370 healthy controls, while significantly lower compared to 907 bout-onset MS (BOMS) cases (wGRS= 20.9 vs 21.2; p<0.0001). The difference was even larger for PINS with peripheral nervous system involvement (wGRS=20.6) vs BOMS. CONCLUSION: The distinction between MS and PINS is not easy to make in clinical practice. However, our study shows that the new set of MS risk alleles does not confer increased susceptibility to PINS. These data support the importance to discriminate these cases from MS with pathophysiological and therapeutic implications.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Multiple recent studies have reported on diffusion tensor-based fiber  tracking of cranial nerves in vestibular schwannoma, with conflicting results as to the accuracy of the method and the occurrence of cochlear nerve depiction. Probabilistic nontensor-based tractography might offer advantages in terms of better extraction of directional information from the underlying data in cranial nerves, which are of subvoxel size. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with large vestibular schwannomas were recruited. The probabilistic tracking was run preoperatively and the position of the potential depictions of the facial and cochlear nerves was estimated postoperatively by 3 independent observers in a blinded fashion. The true position of the nerve was determined intraoperatively by the surgeon. Thereafter, the imaging-based estimated position was compared with the intraoperatively determined position. Tumor size, cystic appearance, and postoperative House-Brackmann score were analyzed with regard to the accuracy of the depiction of the nerves. RESULTS: The probabilistic tracking showed a connection that correlated to the position of the facial nerve in 81% of the cases and to the position of the cochlear nerve in 33% of the cases. Altogether, the resulting depiction did not correspond to the intraoperative position of any of the nerves in 3 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In a majority of cases, the position of the facial nerve, but not of the cochlear nerve, could be estimated by evaluation of the probabilistic tracking results. However, false depictions not corresponding to any nerve do occur and cannot be discerned as such from the image only.

N2  - AIM: To evaluate the relationship between trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and potential  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-related measurements in patients with TN. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 104 patients with TN was performed. MRI studies of 98 healthy controls were included in the study to compare the parameters with TN patientsâ€™ measurements. MRI measurements of cerebellopontine cistern (CPC) cross-sectional area, trigeminal-pontine angle (TPA) width, and trigeminal nerve cisternal segment length and thickness were assessed on both symptomatic and asymptomatic sides using 1.5T MRI with constructive interference in steady-state sequences. The images were interpreted by two radiologists blinded to the affected sides of the patients. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides in terms of mean trigeminal nerve length (8.8 ± 2.34 mm vs. 9.39 ± 2.29 mm; respectively, p=0.001) and thickness (20.9 ± 9.6 mm2 vs. 25 ± 9.98 mm2, respectively; p < 0.001). The median cerebellopontine cistern cross-sectional area was considerably lower on the symptomatic side compared with the asymptomatic side [201 mm2 (interquartile range=93) vs. 224.5 mm2 (interquartile range=77), respectively; p < 0.001]. There were no significant differences between the trigeminal-pontine angle width on either side (38.32 ± 10.38 vs. 38.78 ± 10.9, respectively; p=0.679). There were no statistically significant differences between the right and left sides regarding these parameters in the control group. CONCLUSION: Smaller CPC cross-sectional area, trigeminal nerve length, and trigeminal nerve thickness on MRI were demonstrated to commonly exist on the symptomatic side in patients with TN. We suggest that this narrow space may increase the risk of vascular compression on the nerve.

N2  - The need for non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerves that can reliably assess  extent of nerve fiber degeneration and regeneration is increasingly realized. Availability of such a technology has several immediate clinical and preclinical applications. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an emerging magnetic resonance based technology that is particularly suited for imaging nerve fiber tracts. This review highlights immediate clinical and preclinical uses of non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerve regeneration and DTI as a potential technology that can fulfill these clinical and research needs.

N2  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to propose a semiautomated  technique to segment and measure the volume of different nerve components of the tibial nerve, such as the nerve fascicles and the epineurium, based on magnetic resonance microneurography and a segmentation tool derived from brain imaging; and to assess the reliability of this method by measuring interobserver and intraobserver agreement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tibial nerve of 20 healthy volunteers (age range = 23-69; mean = 47; standard deviation = 15) was investigated at the ankle level. High-resolution images were obtained through tailored microneurographic sequences, covering 28 mm of nerve length. Two operators manually segmented the nerve using the in-phase image. This region of interest was used to mask the nerve in the water image, and two-class segmentation was performed to measure the fascicular volume, epineurial volume, nerve volume, and fascicular to nerve volume ratio (FNR). Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were calculated. RESULTS: The nerve structure was clearly visualized with distinction of the fascicles and the epineurium. Segmentation provided absolute volumes for nerve volume, fascicular volume, and epineurial volume. The mean FNR resulted in 0.69 with a standard deviation of 0.04 and appeared to be not correlated with age and sex. Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were excellent with alpha values >0.9 for each parameter investigated, with measurements free of systematic errors at the Bland-Altman analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the method is reproducible and the parameter FNR is a novel feature that may help in the diagnosis of neuropathies detecting changes in volume of the fascicles or the epineurium.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the reliability and reproducibility of peripheral nerve  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the test-retest and interrater reliability studies of peripheral nerve DTI in a cohort of 12 healthy subjects (mean age 44.0 years, range 26-71 years). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed on a 3T scanner (MR750, GE Healthcare). DTI and T1 -weighted sequences were performed on the tibial and peroneal nerves in the knee. Each subject was scanned on three separate occasions. Image analyses were performed at two anatomic positions: the level of the lateral femoral condyle (position 1), and the superior pole of the patella (position 2). Analysis was performed using three software packages ("raters"): FuncTools, FSL, and Diffusion Toolkit. Metrics obtained included fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). RESULTS: DTI metrics were not significantly different between each measurement position, except peroneal nerve AD and tibial nerve RD were higher at position 1 (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). There was no significant difference in DTI metrics between male and female subjects (P = 0.10-0.99). The test-retest reliability of DTI metrics was high, maximal for FA (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96). ICC values for individual DTI metrics were similar between each measurement position, except that tibial nerve AD was significantly higher at position 2 (P = 0.03). Interrater reliability was also high (ICC = 0.95-0.96). CONCLUSION: We found peripheral nerve DTI to be reliable and reproducible, with few effects related to the postprocessing package used.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging markers have been widely used to detect and  quantify white matter pathologies in multiple sclerosis. We have recently developed a diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) to distinguish and quantify co-existing axonal injury, demyelination, and inflammation in multiple sclerosis patients and animal models. It could serve as a longitudinal marker for axonal loss, a primary cause of permanent neurological impairments and disease progression. METHODS: Eight 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice underwent optic nerve DBSI, followed by a week-long recuperation prior to active immunization for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Visual acuity of all mice was assessed daily. Longitudinal DBSI was performed in mouse optic nerves at baseline (naïve, before immunization), before, during, and after the onset of optic neuritis. Tissues were perfusion fixed after final in vivo scans. The correlation between DBSI detected pathologies and corresponding immunohistochemistry markers was quantitatively assessed. RESULTS: In this cohort of EAE mice, monocular vision impairment occurred in all animals. In vivo DBSI detected, differentiated, and quantified optic nerve inflammation, demyelination, and axonal injury/loss, correlating nerve pathologies with visual acuity at different time points of acute optic neuritis. DBSI quantified, in the presence of optic nerve swelling, ~15% axonal loss at the onset of optic neuritis in EAE mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the notion that axonal loss could occur early in EAE mice. DBSI detected pathologies in the posterior visual pathway unreachable by optical coherence tomography and without confounding inflammation induced optic nerve swelling. DBSI could thus decipher the interrelationship among various pathological components and the role each plays in disease progression. Quantification of the rate of axonal loss could potentially serve as the biomarker to predict treatment outcome and to determine when progressive disease starts.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ultrasound (US) characteristics of peripheral nerves in  chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and their correlations with electrodiagnostic (EDX) characteristics. METHODS: Nineteen patients with CIDP and 19 healthy controls matched by age and body mass index were included in a blind case-control, observational study. All patients underwent a neurologic examination (including inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment [INCAT] and Medical Research Council [MRC] sum score) and an EDX study. Each patient and each control underwent a US study of 14 nerve segments, yielding a total number of 266 segments scanned in each group. RESULTS: US changes, characterized by an increased nerve cross-sectional area (NCSA), were detected in 53% of the 266 patient nerve segments. Mean NCSA was higher in nerve segments of patients than in those of controls (p < 0.001). Nerve segments with abnormal US belonged to patients with longer disease duration, lower MRC sum score, higher INCAT score, and progressive disease form (all p < 0.0001). All the aforementioned variables were independently associated with the occurrence of US changes. Motor nerve conduction was significantly lower in nerve segments with increased NCSA than in those with normal NCSA (p < 0.0001). NCSA in segments with prevalent myelin damage was higher than that in segments with prevalent axonal damage (p = 0.001) or in segments with normal EDX characteristics (p < 0.0001). NCSA and motor nerve conduction velocity were inversely correlated in nerve segments with EDX evidence of myelin damage (R = 0.599; p < 0.0001). Conduction blocks were associated with increased NCSA (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: US may, similar to MRI, have a supporting role in the diagnosis of CIDP. US and EDX changes are correlated.

N2  - PURPOSE: To implement a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol for visualization of  peripheral nerves in human forearm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from 10 healthy participants. T(1) - and T(2) -weighted turbo spin echo with fat saturation, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and DTI sequences with 21 diffusion-encoding directions were implemented to acquire images of the forearm nerves with an 8 channel knee coil on a 3T MRI scanner. Identification of the nerves was based on T(1) -weighted, T(2) -weighted, STIR, and DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) images. Maps of the DTI-derived indices, FA, mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity (λ(//) ), and radial diffusivity (λ(⟂) ) along the length of the nerves were generated. RESULTS: DTI-derived maps delineated the forearm nerves more clearly than images acquired with other sequences. Only ulnar and median nerves were clearly visualized on the DTI-derived FA maps. No significant differences were observed between the left and right forearms in any of the DTI-derived measures. Significant variation in the DTI measures was observed along the length of the nerve. Significant differences in the DTI measures were also observed between the median and ulnar nerves. CONCLUSION: DTI is superior in visualizing the median and ulnar nerves in the human forearm. The normative data could potentially help distinguish normal from diseased nerves.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to establish dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion  in peripheral nerves for determination of blood-nerve permeability (K) and nerve blood volume (NBV) in peripheral neuropathies as compared with healthy controls. METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Forty-three controls (24 women, 19 men; age, 48.7 ± 17.5 years) and 59 patients with peripheral neuropathy (28 women, 31 men; age, 52.7 ± 12.4 years) were examined by a standard protocol including a T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence (time of repetition/time of echo, 4.91/1.64; 10 slices; resolution 0.8 × 0.6 × 3.0 mm3). Time - signal intensity analysis was performed by normalizing to pre-bolus arrival and calculating the mean contrast uptake (MCU) for each patient. Further analyses were performed by customized software to calculate K trans and NBV. Statistical analysis included 2-sided Student's t tests of controls versus patients, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and subgroup analysis of patients according to etiologies of neuropathy. RESULTS: Time-signal intensity analysis showed significantly increased contrast uptake in patients as compared with controls (MCU, 1.29 ± 0.15 vs 1.18 ± 0.08; P < 0.001). This was caused mainly by an increase in K trans (0.046 ± 0.025 vs 0.026 ± 0.016 min(-1); P < 0.001) and less by an increase in NBV (3.9 ± 2.6 vs 3.0 ± 1.9 mL/100 mL; P = 0.12). This trend was true for all etiologies except entrapment neuropathies. Excluding these, receiver operating characteristic analysis found an area under the curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.89) for MCU and 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.90) for K to discriminate neuropathy from control. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion is a feasible technique to assess K trans and NBV in peripheral nerves and may be used in future investigations on peripheral neuropathies.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether pretreatment magnetic resonance (MR)-based radiomics  nomogram can individualize prediction of perineural invasion (PNI) status in rectal cancer (RC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 122 RC patients with pathologically confirmed were classified as training cohort (n = 87) and test cohort (n = 35). 180 radiomics features were extracted from all lesions based on oblique axial T(2)WI TSE images. The dimensionality reduction and feature selection in training cohort were realized by the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. A predictive model combining radiomics features and clinical risk factors (pathological N stage, pathological LVI status) was established by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The performance of the model was assessed based on its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, nomogram, and calibration. RESULTS: The developed radiomics nomogram that integrated the radiomics signature and clinical risk factors could provide discrimination in the training and test cohorts. The accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) for assessing PNI status were 0.82, 0.86, respectively, in the training cohort, while they were 0.71 and 0.85 in the test cohort. The goodness-of-fit of the nomogram was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p = 0.52 in training cohort and p = 0.24 in test cohort). Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: The developed radiomics nomogram might be helpful in the individualized assessment PNI status in patients with RC. This stratification of RC patients according to their PNI status may provide the basis for individualized adjuvant therapy, especially for stage II patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been applied in the lumbar and sacral  nerves in vivo, but information about the reproducibility of this method is needed before DTI can be used reliably in clinical practice across centers. PURPOSE: In this multicenter study the reproducibility of DTI of the lumbosacral nerves in healthy volunteers was investigated. STUDY TYPE: Prospective control series. SUBJECTS: Twenty healthy subjects. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T MRI. 3D turbo spin echo, and 3.0 mm isotropic DTI scan. ASSESSMENT: The DTI scan was performed three times (twice in the same session, intrascan reproducibility, and once after an hour, interscan reproducibility). At site 2, 1 week later, the protocol was repeated (interweek reproducibility). Fiber tractography (FT) of the lumbar and sacral nerves (L3-S2) was performed to obtain values for fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity. STATISTICAL TESTS: Reproducibility was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and power calculations were performed. RESULTS: FT was successful and reproducible in all datasets. ICCs for all diffusion parameters were high for intrascan (ranging from 0.70-0.85), intermediate for interscan (ranging from 0.61-0.73), and interweek reliability (ranging from 0.58-0.62). There were small but significant differences between the interweek diffusivity values (P < 0.0005). Depending on the effect size, nerve location, and parameter of interest, power calculations showed that sample sizes between 10 and 232 subjects are needed for cross-sectional studies. DATA CONCLUSION: We found that DTI and FT of the lumbosacral nerves have intermediate to high reproducibility within and between scans. Based on these results, 10-58 subjects are needed to find a 10% change in parameters in cross-sectional studies of the lumbar and sacral nerves. The small significant differences of the interweek comparison suggest that results from longitudinal studies need to be interpreted carefully, since small differences may also be caused by factors other than disease progression or therapeutic effects.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerve injury is a common and important cause of morbidity and  disability in patients who have suffered a traumatic injury, particularly younger people. Various different injuries can result in damage to specific nerves. In patients with multiple trauma, the prevalence of peripheral nerve injury is estimated at 2.8%, but can reach 5% with the inclusion of brachial plexus involvement. Physical examination, as well as the origin and location of the trauma, can indicate the nerve involved and the type of nerve damage. However, the depth and severity of damage, and the structures involved often cannot be determined initially, but depend on longer periods of observation to reach a definitive and accurate diagnosis for which treatment can be proposed. Current approaches to locate and assess the severity of traumatic nerve injury involve clinical and electrodiagnostic studies. From a clinical and neurophysiological point of view, nerve injuries are classified in an attempt to correlate the degree of injury with symptoms, type of pathology, and prognosis, as well as to determine the therapy to be adopted. OBJECTIVES: MRI in the diagnosis of traumatic peripheral nerve injury has increasingly been used by surgeons in clinical practice. In this article, we analyze the use of magnetic resonance (MR) for the evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve diseases that are surgically treatable. We also consider basic concepts in the evaluation of technical and MR signs of peripheral nerve injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were identified following a computerized search of MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present), and the Cochrane database. The MEDLINE search was conducted on PUBMED, the EMBASE search was conducted on OVID, and the Cochrane database was conducted using their online library. A set was created using the terms: 'traumatic', 'nerve', and 'resonance'. RESULTS: The included articles were identified using a computerized search and the resulting databases were then sorted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This yielded 10,340 articles (MEDLINE, n = 758; EMBASE, n = 9564; and Cochrane, n = 18). A search strategy was then built by excluding articles that only concern plexus injury and adding the terms 'neuropathies', 'DTI' and 'neurotmesis'. In total, seven studies were included in the review effectively addressing the role of MRI in the evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injury. We extracted all relevant information on the imaging findings and the use of magnetic resonance in trauma. We did not include technical or specific radiological aspects of the imaging techniques. CONCLUSIONS: These seven articles were subsequently evaluated by analyzing their results, methodological approach, and conclusions presented.

N2  - Peripheral nerve injuries result in severe loss of sensory and motor functions in  the afflicted limb. There is a lack of standardised models to non-invasively study degeneration, regeneration, and normalisation of neuronal microstructure in peripheral nerves. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive evaluation of peripheral nerve injuries, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and tractography on a rat model of sciatic nerve injury. 10 female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to sciatic nerve neurotmesis and studied using a 9.4 T magnet, by performing DTI and DKI of the sciatic nerve before and 4 weeks after injury. The distal nerve stump showed a decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis (MK), axonal water fraction (AWF), and radial and axonal kurtosis (RK, AK) after injury. The proximal stump showed a significant decrease in axial diffusivity (AD) and increase of MK and AK as compared with the uninjured nerve. Both mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) increased in the distal stump after injury. Tractography visualised the sciatic nerve and the site of injury, as well as local variations of the diffusion parameters following injury. In summary, the described method detects changes both proximal and distal to the nerve injury.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included a total of 77 wrists; 18 normal, 35 wrists with mild, 9 wrists with moderate and 15 wrists with severe carpal tunnel syndrome. Elastography of the median nerve was performed by defining the boundaries of a segment of the nerve at sagittal plane at the level of proximal carpal row. Additionally, the cross-sectional area of the median nerve was evaluated. Fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient measurements were carried out by placing region-of-interest at three levels: at pisiform bone (carpal tunnel inlet), mid carpal tunnel, and hook of hamate (carpal tunnel outlet). RESULTS: Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome had higher elasticity values of median nerve (53.0 kPa; IQR 40.8-77.0 kPa) compared to control subjects. (36.8 kPa; IQR 31.0-39.9 kPa) Patients with moderate-severe carpal tunnel syndrome had higher elasticity values (82 kPa; IQR 64.0-95.5 kPa) compared to patients with mild carpal tunnel syndrome. (44 kPa; IQR 32.5-59.5 kPa) Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome had lower fractional anisotropy at mid-carpal level (0.382; IQR 0.330-0.495) compared to the control group. (0.494; IQR 0.434-0.537) Patients with moderate-severe carpal tunnel syndrome had lower fractional anisotropy values (0.366; IQR 0.331-0.407) and higher apparent diffusion coefficient values (1.509 mm(2)/s; IQR 1.374-1.733 mm(2)/s) compared to patients with mild carpal tunnel syndrome. (0,423; IQR 0.324-0.526 and 1.293 mm(2)/s; IQR 0.967-1.514 mm(2)/s) CONCLUSION: Shear-wave elastography and diffusion tensor imaging are helpful imaging modalities in diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome and assessing its severity.

N2  - PURPOSE: To implement high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for  visualization and quantification of peripheral nerves in human forearm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all the study participants. Images were acquired with T1 -and T2 -weighted turbo spin echo with/without fat saturation, short tau inversion recovery (STIR). In addition, high spatial resolution (1.0 × 1.0 × 3.0 mm(3) ) DTI sequence was optimized for clearly visualizing ulnar, superficial radial and median nerves in the forearm. Maps of the DTI derived indices, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity (λ// ) and radial diffusivity (λ⊥ ) were generated. RESULTS: For the first time, the three peripheral nerves, ulnar, superficial radial, and median, were visualized unequivocally on high resolution DTI-derived maps. DTI delineated the forearm nerves more clearly than other sequences. Significant differences in the DTI-derived measures, FA, MD, λ// and λ⊥ , were observed among the three nerves. A strong correlation between the nerve size derived from FA map and T2 -weighted images was observed. CONCLUSION: High spatial resolution DTI is superior in identifying and quantifying the median, ulnar, and superficial radial nerves in human forearm. Consistent visualization of small nerves and nerve branches is possible with high spatial resolution DTI. These normative data could potentially help in identifying pathology in diseased nerves. J.

N2  - AIM: To investigate the applicability of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance  neurography (DW-MRN) in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 47 patients with CTS (69 wrists) and 19 normal participants (38 wrists) was included in this study. Cross-sectional area (CSA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median nerves in the carpal tunnel were determined using DW-MRN. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. RESULTS: No significant differences in age or body mass index (BMI) were observed between the control and CTS groups. DW-MRN imaging showed obvious hyperintensity in the lesions in CTS wrists, while other nerve regions were related to slight hyperintensity. Interobserver variability analysis indicated excellent agreement regarding both the CSA and ADC measurements for the control and CTS groups. Both the mean CSA and ADC values of the median nerves in carpal tunnel in the CTS group were significantly higher than the control group. According to the ROC analysis, the CSA cut-off value was 11.7 mm(2), and sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 89.5%, respectively. Conversely, the median nerve ADC cut-off value was 1.047×10(-3) mm(2)/s. The sensitivity and specificity were 91.3% and 76.3.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: DW-MRN represents a highly reproducible diagnostic technique for CTS. The ADC value of median nerves in the carpal tunnel is significantly higher in CTS patients, which provides a potential powerful tool for the disease diagnosis.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Investigation of peripheral neuropathies by magnetic resonance  neurography (MRN) may provide increased diagnostic accuracy when performed in combination with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This study seeks to evaluate DTI in the detection of neuropathic abnormalities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A). METHODS: MRI of the sciatic and tibial nerves, including MRN and DTI, was prospectively performed in 15 CMT1A patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs). The following MRI parameters were evaluated and correlated with clinical and neurophysiological findings: T2-relaxation time, proton spin density (PD) and DTI (fractional anisotropy [FA] and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]). RESULTS: DTI showed lower FA and higher ADC in CMT1A compared with HCs. T2 relaxation time showed no difference; however, PD of the sciatic nerve was higher in CMT1A. There were some close associations between neuropathy severity and MRN-DTI, with the closest correlation between FA and nerve conduction velocity in the sciatic nerve (r = 0.76, P < 0.01). DISCUSSION: MRN-DTI evaluation of sciatic and tibial nerves improves the detection of nerve abnormalities in patients with CMT1A. Muscle Nerve 56: E78-E84, 2017.

N2  - AIM: To evaluate inter-reader performance for cross-sectional area and fat  quantification of bilateral sciatic nerves on MRI and assess correlations with anthropometrics. METHODS: In this IRB-approved, HIPPA-compliant study, three readers performed a cross-sectional analysis of 3T lumbosacral plexus MRIs over an 18-month period. Image slices were evaluated at two levels (A and B). The sciatic nerve was outlined using a free hand region of interest tool on PACS. Proton-density fat fraction (FF) and cross-sectional areas were recorded. Inter-reader agreement was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Spearman correlation coefficients were used for correlations with age, BMI and height and Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess gender differences. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients were included in this study with male to female ratio of 1:1. Inter-reader agreement was good to excellent for FF measurements at both levels (ICC=0.71-0.90) and poor for sciatic nerve areas (ICC=0.08-0.27). Positive correlations of sciatic FF and area were seen with age (p value<0.05). Males had significantly higher sciatic intraneural fat than females (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Fat quantification MRI is highly reproducible with significant positive correlations of sciatic FF and area with age, which may have implications for MRI diagnosis of sciatic neuropathy. KEY POINTS: • MR proton density fat fraction is highly reproducible at multiple levels. • Sciatic intraneural fat is positively correlated with increasing age (p < 0.05). • Positive correlations exist between bilateral sciatic nerve areas and age (p < 0.05). • Males had significantly higher sciatic intraneural fat than females (p < 0.05).

N2  - PURPOSE: Given no definite consensus on the accepted autograft orientation during  peripheral nerve injury repair, we compare outcomes between reverse and normally oriented autografts using an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique, diffusion tensor imaging. METHODS: Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: sham-left sciatic nerve isolation without injury, reverse autograft-10-mm cut left sciatic nerve segment reoriented 180° and used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps, or normally oriented autograft-10-mm cut nerve segment kept in its normal orientation for coaptation. Animals underwent sciatic functional index and foot fault behavior studies at 72 hours, and then weekly. At 6 weeks, axons proximal, within, and distal to the autograft were evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging and choline acetyltransferase motor staining for immunohistochemistry. Toluidine blue staining of 1-μm sections was used to assess axon count, density, and diameter. Bilateral gastrocnemius/soleus muscle weights were compared to obtain a net wet weight. Comparison of the groups was performed using Mann-Whiney U or Kruskal-Wallis H tests to determine significance. RESULTS: Diffusion tensor imaging findings including fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity were similar between reverse and normally oriented autografts. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography demonstrated proximodistal nerve regeneration in both autograft groups. Motor axon counts proximal, within, and distal to the autografts were similar. Likewise, axon count, density, and diameter were similar between the autograft groups. Muscle net weight at 6 weeks and behavioral outcomes (sciatic functional index and foot fault) at any tested time point were also similar between reverse and normally oriented autografts. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging may be a useful assessment tool for peripheral nerve regeneration. Reversing nerve autograft polarity did not demonstrate to have an influence on functional or regenerative outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerve injury is often followed by a highly variable recovery  process with respect to both rapidity and efficacy. Identifying post-nerve injury phenomena is key to assessing the merit and timing of surgery as well as to tracking nerve recovery postoperatively. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has been investigated in the clinical and research settings as a noninvasive technique to both assess and monitor each patient's unique case of peripheral nerve damage. NEW METHOD: We identify a MRI-suitable marker for tracking the exact site of either nerve injury or coaptation following surgical repair to aid with DTI analysis. RESULTS: Due to artefact and disruption of tractography, silver wire and microvascular clips were not suitable markers. AxoGuard®, 4-0 vicryl suture, and 10-0 polyamide suture, although detectable, did not produce a signal easily distinguished from post-surgical changes. Silicone was easily identifiable and stable in both the acute and delayed time points, exhibited negligible impact on DTI parameters, and possessed geometry to prevent nerve strangulation. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: Prior studies have not assessed the efficacy of other markers nor have they assessed silicone for potential artefact with DTI parameter analysis. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the reliability and compatibility of silicone in the delayed postoperative time period and includes its unique imaging appearance on high-resolution 11.7 MRI. CONCLUSION: Semi-cylindrical silicone tubing can be used as a safe, reliable, and readily available radiological marker to visualize and monitor a region of interest on a rodent's peripheral nerve for aiding assessments with diffusion tensor imaging.

N2  - Objective: The aim was to compare the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent  diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the sciatic and femoral nerves in patients with unilateral osteoarthritis of the hip (OA) and osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to investigate the mechanism of hip pain. Methods: Forty-four patients (22 OA and 22 ONFH) underwent DTI of the sciatic and femoral nerves at the level of the hip joint and the S1 roots to visualize the tractography and quantify the FA and ADC values. Results: The tractography of the femoral and the sciatic nerves on the affected side with OA and ONFH were similar to those on the normal side. The mean FA values of the sciatic and femoral nerves, and the S1 roots were 0.542, 0.551, and 0.316 with OA, 0.568, 0.560, and 0.318 with ONFH on the affected side, and 0.559, 0.560, and 0.315 on the normal side, respectively, and did not show significant differences. The FA values of the sciatic nerve on the affected side with OA decreased with longer pain duration. Conclusion: The FA and ADC values of the sciatic and femoral nerves in patients with unilateral OA and ONFH showed no significant differences between the affected and normal sides.

N2  - PURPOSE: Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) is a rare intracranial arterial vasculopathy which  can occur in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) disease, representing a cause of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) impairment, possibly leading to ischemic stroke. Here, we evaluated noninvasive imaging techniques used to assess CVR in MMS patients, describing clinical and imaging findings in patients affected by MMS-NF1. METHODS: Following strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, in this retrospective observational study, we evaluated imaging data of nine consecutive MMS-NF1 patients (M/F = 5/4, mean age: 12.6 ± 4.0). Subjects underwent a multimodal evaluation of cerebral vascular status, including intracranial arterial MR Angiography (MRA), MRI perfusion with dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) technique, and 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT. RESULTS: In 8 out 9 patients (88.8%, 6/8 symptomatic), time-to-peak maps were correlated with the involved cerebral hemisphere, while in 6 out 9 patients (66.6%, 5/6 symptomatic), mean transit time (MTT) maps showed correspondence with the affected cerebrovascular territories. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) calculated using DSC perfusion failed to detect the hypoperfused regions instead identified by SPECT-CBF in all patients, while MTT maps overlapped with SPECT-CBF data in all cases and time-to-peak maps in 60.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Although SPECT imaging still represents the gold standard for CBF assessment, our results suggest that data obtained using DSC perfusion technique, and in particular MTT maps, might be a very useful and noninvasive tool for evaluating hemodynamic status in MMS-NF1 patients.

N2  - In vestibular schwannoma surgery, the preservation of facial and cochlear nerves is  of paramount concern regarding to their effect on patients' quality of life. The rate of nerve function preservation has increased with advancements in surgical technique and neuroimaging and the introduction of intraoperative neuromonitoring. The preoperative depiction of anatomical issues between the nerves and tumor could help in surgical planning. Many studies investigating advanced imaging for cranial nerves detection, in particular diffusion tensor imaging, have been reported in the past decade. A systematic review of the reported data evaluating preoperative facial nerve fiber tracking, followed by intraoperative verification, was conducted. Seventeen studies with 223 patients (mean age, 47.5 years; range 17-77; male/female ratio 1:1.4) met our inclusion criteria. Preoperative facial nerve fiber tracking was obtained for 214 patients (96%), and subsequent intraoperative verification revealed a correct prediction for 187 cases (85.5%). The results from the present review have confirmed that preoperative fiber tracking for facial nerve identification during large vestibular schwannoma surgery is valuable and reliable. However, the included studies were not comparable in terms of images, acquisitions, or postprocessing elaboration. Larger series and homogenous magnetic resonance imaging parameters are required to strengthen these findings.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Methods were invented that made it possible to image peripheral nerves in  the body and to image neural tracts in the brain. The history, physical basis, and dyadic tensor concept underlying the methods are reviewed. Over a 15-year period, these techniques-magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and diffusion tensor imaging-were deployed in the clinical and research community in more than 2500 published research reports and applied to approximately 50,000 patients. Within this group, approximately 5000 patients having MRN were carefully tracked on a prospective basis. METHODS: A uniform Neurography imaging methodology was applied in the study group, and all images were reviewed and registered by referral source, clinical indication, efficacy of imaging, and quality. Various classes of image findings were identified and subjected to a variety of small targeted prospective outcome studies. Those findings demonstrated to be clinically significant were then tracked in the larger clinical volume data set. RESULTS: MRN demonstrates mechanical distortion of nerves, hyperintensity consistent with nerve irritation, nerve swelling, discontinuity, relations of nerves to masses, and image features revealing distortion of nerves at entrapment points. These findings are often clinically relevant and warrant full consideration in the diagnostic process. They result in specific pathological diagnoses that are comparable to electrodiagnostic testing in clinical efficacy. A review of clinical outcome studies with diffusion tensor imaging also shows convincing utility. CONCLUSION: MRN and diffusion tensor imaging neural tract imaging have been validated as indispensable clinical diagnostic methods that provide reliable anatomic pathological information. There is no alternative diagnostic method in many situations. With the elapsing of 15 years, tens of thousands of imaging studies, and thousands of publications, these methods should no longer be considered experimental.

N2  - Development of outcome measures to assess ongoing nerve regeneration in the living  animal that can be translated to human can provide extremely useful tools for monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions to promote nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance based technique, provides image contrast for nerve tracts and can be applied serially on the same subject with potential to monitor nerve fiber content. In this study, we examined the use of ex vivo high-resolution DTI for imaging intact and regenerating peripheral nerves in mice and correlated the MRI findings with electrophysiology and histology. DTI was done on sciatic nerves with crush, without crush, and after complete transection in different mouse strains. DTI measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA), parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity were acquired and compared in segments of uninjured and crushed/transected nerves and correlated with morphometry. A comparison of axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush showed a comparable pattern of regeneration in different mice strains. FA values were significantly lower in completely denervated nerve segments compared to uninjured sciatic nerve and this signal was restored toward normal in regenerating nerve segments (crushed nerves). Histology data indicate that the FA values and the parallel diffusivity showed a positive correlation with the total number of regenerating axons. These studies suggest that DTI is a sensitive measure of axon regeneration in mouse models and provide basis for further development of imaging technology for application to living animals and humans.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Clinical investigations of peripheral nerve lesions routinely  involve nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Imaging studies are often used to exclude focal mass lesions or external compression and to visualize muscle atrophy. More recently, it has been recognized that magnetic resonance imaging can identify changes in peripheral nerves and secondary neurogenic alterations in skeletal muscle, which may significantly enhance its use in the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute axonal nerve lesions cause a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images at and distal to the lesion site, which correlates with Wallerian degeneration and nerve oedema. Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles provide an exciting new tool to detect the invasion of macrophages into the degenerating nerve distal to an axonal lesion. Prolongation of the T2 relaxation time and gadolinium enhancement of denervated muscle develop in parallel to the development of spontaneous activity on electromyography, and are probably the consequence of capillary enlargement and increased muscular blood volume. SUMMARY: Magnetic resonance imaging supplements the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. An advantage over clinical neurophysiological investigations is that it is operator independent and painless. It can identify axonal damage and may thus help to identify a lesion site precisely, where fractionated nerve conduction studies are not applicable. Novel contrast media may potentially be used to detect pathophysiologically relevant mechanisms such as infiltration of the nerve by macrophages. Magnetic resonance imaging also has the advantage of providing a lasting detailed topographical picture of regional variations and avoids localization errors of muscles in electromyography.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters  as in-vivo biomarkers of axon and myelin sheath integrity of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. METHODS: MRI examinations at 3T including DTI were conducted on wrists in 30 healthy subjects. After manual segmentation of the median nerve quantitative analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as axial, radial and mean diffusivity (AD, RD, and MD) was carried out. Pairwise Pearson correlations with electrophysiological parameters comprising sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) as markers of axon integrity, and distal motor latency (dml) and sensory nerve conduction velocity (sNCV) as markers of myelin sheath integrity were computed. The significance criterion was set at P=0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: DTI parameters showed a distinct proximal-to-distal profile with FA, MD, and RD extrema coinciding in the center of the carpal tunnel. AD correlated with CMAP (r=0.50, p=0.04, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of myelin sheath integrity. RD correlated with sNCV (r=-0.53, p=0.02, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of axon integrity. FA correlated with dml (r=-0.63, p=0.002, Bonf. corr.) and sNCV (r=0.68, p=0.001, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of axon integrity. CONCLUSION: AD reflects axon integrity, while RD (and FA) reflect myelin sheath integrity as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. DTI parameters consistently indicate a slight decrease of structural integrity in the carpal tunnel as a physiological site of median nerve entrapment. DTI is particularly sensitive, since these findings are observed in healthy participants. Our results encourage future studies to evaluate the potential of DTI in differentiating axon from myelin sheath injury in patients with manifest peripheral neuropathies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain (NP) is frequent in neuromyelitis optica spectrum  disorders (NMOSD). The ventral posterior nucleus (VPN) of the thalamus receives sensory afferences from the spinothalamic tracts and is associated with central pain in other conditions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between NP and VPN volume in aquaporin-4-IgG- positive (AQP4-IgG+) NMOSD. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 32 AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD patients and 37 healthy controls. NP intensity was determined by the PainDetect Questionnaire. Spinal cord lesion number and location as well as VPN volume were assessed by MRI, the latter using a multi-atlas-based automated segmentation. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (78%) suffered from NP and seven had no pain. Mean VPN volume did not differ between patients with and without NP (p=0.533) or between patients and controls. However, mean VPN volume correlated with average (rho=-0.486, p=0.019) and worst pain intensity (rho=-0.593, p=0.003). Of note, no other thalamic nuclei volumes correlated with measures of pain intensity. Compared to pain-free patients, patients with NP had more lesions involving the thoracic spinal cord (p=0.007). The relationships between VPN and pain intensity measures remained after adjustment for age, myelitis count, and spinal cord lesion location. CONCLUSION: Our data support a model where thoracic spinal cord lesions are associated with the development of NP in AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD and the VPN plays a role in the modulation of NP intensity. VPN volume as assessed in our study may be a clinically meaningful imaging marker of pain severity in AQP4-IgG+ NMOSD.

N2  - The aim of this study was to assess with MRI morphometric ultrastructural changes in  nerves affected by diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). We used an MR micro-neurography imaging protocol and a semiautomated technique of tissue segmentation to visualize and measure the volume of internal nerve components, such as the epineurium and nerve fascicles. The tibial nerves of 16 patients affected by DPN and of 15 healthy volunteers were imaged. Nerves volume (NV), fascicles volume (FV), fascicles to nerve ratio (FNR), and nerves cross-sectional areas (CSA) were obtained. In patients with DPN the NV was increased and the FNR was decreased, as a result of an increase of the epineurium (FNR in diabetic neuropathy 0,665; in controls 0,699, p = 0,040). CSA was increased in subjects with DPN (12,84 mm(2) versus 10,22 mm(2), p = 0,003). The FV was increased in patients with moderate to severe DPN. We have demonstrated structural changes occurring in nerves affected by DPN, which otherwise are assessable only with an invasive biopsy. MR micro-neurography appears to be suitable for the study of microscopic changes in tibial nerves of diabetic patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of  the cervical spinal cord could aid the (differential) diagnosis of sensory neuronopathies, an underdiagnosed group of diseases of the peripheral nervous system. METHODS: We obtained spinal cord DTI and T2WI at 3 T from 28 patients, 14 diabetic subjects with sensory-motor distal polyneuropathy, and 20 healthy controls. We quantified DTI-based parameters and looked at the hyperintense T2W signal at the spinal cord posterior columns. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values at C2-C3 and C3-C4 levels were compared between groups. We also compared average fractional anisotropy (mean of values at C2-C3 and C3-C4 levels). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine diagnostic accuracy of average fractional anisotropy, and we compared its sensitivity against the hyperintense signal in segregating patients from the other subjects. RESULTS: Mean age and disease duration were 52 ± 10 and 11.4 ± 9.3 years in the patient group. Eighteen subjects had idiopathic disease and 6 dysimmune etiology. Fractional anisotropy at C3-C4 level and average fractional anisotropy were significantly different between patients and healthy controls (p < 0.001 and <0.001) and between patients and diabetic subjects (p = 0.019 and 0.027). Average fractional anisotropy presented an area under the curve of 0.838. Moreover, it had higher sensitivity than visual detection of the hyperintense signal (0.86 vs. 0.54), particularly for patients with short disease duration. CONCLUSION: DTI-based analysis enables in vivo detection of posterior column damage in sensory neuronopathy patients and is a useful diagnostic test for this condition. It also helps the differential diagnosis between sensory neuronopathy and distal polyneuropathies.

N2  - We assessed the accuracy of semi-automated tumor volume maps of plexiform  neurofibroma (PN) generated by a deep neural network, compared to manual segmentation using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data. NF1 Patients were recruited from a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of PN. Multiple b-value DWI was imaged over the largest PN. All DWI datasets were registered and intensity normalized prior to segmentation with a multi-spectral neural network classifier (MSNN). Manual volumes of PN were performed on 3D-T2 images registered to diffusion images and compared to MSNN volumes with the Sørensen-Dice coefficient. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters were calculated from resulting volumes. 35 MRI scans were included from 14 subjects. Sørensen-Dice coefficient between the semi-automated and manual segmentation was 0.77 ± 0.016. Perfusion fraction (f) was significantly higher for tumor versus normal tissue (0.47 ± 0.42 vs. 0.30 ± 0.22, p = 0.02), similarly, true diffusion (D) was significantly higher for PN tumor versus normal (0.0018 ± 0.0003 vs. 0.0012 ± 0.0002, p < 0.0001). By contrast, the pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*) was significantly lower for PN tumor versus normal (0.024 ± 0.01 vs. 0.031 ± 0.005, p < 0.0001). Volumes generated by a neural network from multiple diffusion data on PNs demonstrated good correlation with manual volumes. IVIM analysis of multiple b-value diffusion data demonstrates significant differences between PN and normal tissue.

N2  - Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) account for ~ 5% of soft tissue neoplasms and  are responsible for a wide spectrum of morbidities ranging from localized neuropathy to fulminant metastatic spread and death. MR imaging represents the gold standard for identification of these neoplasms, however, current anatomic MR imaging markers do not reliably detect or differentiate benign and malignant lesions, and therefore, biopsy or excision is required for definitive diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) serves as a useful tool in the evaluation and management of PNSTs by providing functional information regarding the degree of diffusion, while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) aids in determining the directional information of predominant diffusion and has been shown to be particularly useful for pre-operative planning of these tumors by delineating healthy and pathologic fascicles. The article focuses on these important neurogenic lesions, highlighting the current utility of diffusion MR imaging and future directions including computerized radiomic analysis. KEY POINTS: • Anatomic MRI is moderately accurate in differentiating benign from malignant PNST. • Diffusion tensor imaging facilitates pre-operative planning of PNSTs by depicting neuropathy and tractography. • Radiomics will likely augment current observer-based diagnostic criteria for PNSTs.

N2  - Small-animal magnetic resonance imaging is becoming an increasingly utilized  noninvasive tool in the study of animal models of MS including the most commonly used autoimmune, viral, and toxic models. Because most MS models are induced in rodents with brains and spinal cords of a smaller magnitude than humans, small-animal MRI must accomplish much higher resolution acquisition in order to generate useful data. In this review, we discuss key aspects and important differences between high field strength experimental and human MRI. We describe the role of conventional imaging sequences including T1, T2, and proton density-weighted imaging, and we discuss the studies aimed at analyzing blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and acute inflammation utilizing gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Advanced MRI methods, including diffusion-weighted and magnetization transfer imaging in monitoring demyelination, axonal damage, and remyelination, and studies utilizing in vivo T1 and T2 relaxometry, provide insight into the pathology of demyelinating diseases at previously unprecedented details. The technical challenges of small voxel in vivo MR spectroscopy and the biologically relevant information obtained by analysis of MR spectra in demyelinating models is also discussed. Novel cell-specific and molecular imaging techniques are becoming more readily available in the study of experimental MS models. As a growing number of tissue restorative and remyelinating strategies emerge in the coming years, noninvasive monitoring of remyelination will be an important challenge in small-animal imaging. High field strength small-animal experimental MRI will continue to evolve and interact with the development of new human MR imaging and experimental NMR techniques.

N2  - PURPOSE: To establish normal values and to identify demographic determinants of  quantitative biomarkers in magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). METHODS: In this study 60 healthy individuals (5 men and 5 women of every decade between 20 and 80 years) were examined according to a standardized MRN protocol at 3 T, including multiecho T2 relaxometry. Nerve cross-sectional area (CSA), transverse relaxation time (T2), and proton spin density (PSD) were assessed for the sciatic, tibial, median, ulnar, and radial nerves. Correlation with demographic variables, such as height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and age was expressed by Pearson coefficients and t‑tests were used to compare MRN biomarkers between men and women with and without normalization to body weight and BMI by linear regression. RESULTS: The average nerve CSA correlated moderately with height (r = 0.28, p = 0.04), weight (r = 0.40, p = 0.002), and BMI (r = 0.35, p = 0.008), but not with age (r = 0.23, p = 0.09). While T2 did not correlate with demographic parameters, PSD was strongly inversely associated with BMI (r = -0.64, p < 0.001) and weight (r = -0.557, p < 0.001). Sex-dependent differences in imaging marker values were found for CSA but became negligible after normalization to body weight. CONCLUSION: Quantitative biomarkers of MRN co-vary with demographic variables. As particularly important determinants, we identified body weight for nerve CSA and BMI for PSD. The presented normal values and demographic determinants may assist investigations into the potential of MRN biomarkers in further disease-specific studies.

N2  - PURPOSE: To study diffusion-prepared neurography optimized for a large field-of-view  (FOV) to include the neck and both shoulders. In a large FOV poor homogeneity of the magnetic field (B0 ) often leads to poor image quality and possibly to poor diagnostic accuracy. The aim was therefore to find an optimal (combination of) shimming method(s) for diffusion-prepared neurography in a large FOV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3D diffusion-prepared sequence with a large FOV was tested with and without the use of a susceptibility-matched pillow combined with image-based (IB) or standard shimming in six healthy volunteers on a 3T system. B0 , B1 , signal to noise ratio (SNR), and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) were compared between all protocols. Additionally, nerve visibility, fat suppression, artifacts, and overall image quality were ordinally (5-point scale) assessed by two readers. Furthermore, correlations between B0 and B1 (offset and variation) and SNR, CNR, and image quality were explored. RESULTS: The use of the susceptibility-matched pillow led to a 43% reduction of B0 variation over the brachial plexus compared to the situation without a pillow (P < 0.05). The combination of the pillow with IB-shimming and the optimized diffusion-prepared sequence resulted in good nerve visibility, good fat suppression, no artifacts that would hinder clinical diagnosis, and a good overall quality (median scores ≥4). Reducing B0 variation was associated with SNR, CNR, and the above-mentioned scored features (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of a susceptibility-matched pillow in combination with IB-shimming enables robust and high-quality neurography of the complete brachial plexus.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) data acquisition protocols are well-established on  modern high-field clinical scanners for human studies. However, these protocols are not suitable for the chimpanzee (or other large-brained mammals) because of its substantial difference in head geometry and brain volume compared with humans. Therefore, an optimal dMRI data acquisition protocol dedicated to chimpanzee neuroimaging is needed. METHODS: A multi-shot (4 segments) double spin-echo echo-planar imaging (MS-EPI) sequence and a single-shot double spin-echo EPI (SS-EPI) sequence were optimized separately for in vivo dMRI data acquisition of chimpanzees using a clinical 3T scanner. Correction for severe susceptibility-induced image distortion and signal drop-off of the chimpanzee brain was performed and evaluated using FSL software. DTI indices in different brain regions and probabilistic tractography were compared. A separate DTI data set from n=34 chimpanzees (13 to 56 years old) was collected using the optimal protocol. Age-related changes in diffusivity indices of optic nerve fibers were evaluated. RESULTS: The SS-EPI sequence acquired dMRI data of the chimpanzee brain with approximately doubled the SNR as the MS-EPI sequence given the same scan time. The quality of white matter fiber tracking from the SS-EPI data was much higher than that from MS-EPI data. However, quantitative analysis of DTI indices showed no difference in most ROIs between the SS-EPI and MS-EPI sequences. The progressive evolution of diffusivity indices of optic nerves indicated mild changes in fiber bundles of chimpanzees aged 40 years and above. CONCLUSION: The single-shot EPI-based acquisition protocol provided better image quality of dMRI for chimpanzee brains and is recommended for in vivo dMRI study or clinical diagnosis of chimpanzees (or other large animals) using a clinical scanner. Also, the tendency of FA decrease or diffusivity increase in the optic nerve of aged chimpanzees was seen but did not show significant age-related changes, suggesting aging may have less impact on optic nerve fiber integrity of chimpanzees, in contrast to previous results for both macaque monkeys and humans.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for  detecting neuropathic changes in proximal nerve segments in patients with peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals with (n = 11) and without (n = 10) peripheral neuropathy underwent DTI of a defined sciatic nerve segment. Patients and controls were evaluated by clinical examination and nerve conduction studies at baseline and 6 months after the initial DTI scan. RESULTS: The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value was significantly lower in sciatic nerves from patients with peripheral neuropathy as compared with controls. Sciatic nerve FA values correlated with clinical disability scores and electrophysiological parameters of axonal damage at baseline and 6 months after MRI scan. CONCLUSIONS: DTI-derived FA values are a sensitive measure to discriminate healthy from functionally impaired human sciatic nerve segments. DTI of proximal nerve segments may be useful for estimating the proximal axonal degeneration burden in patients with peripheral neuropathies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Correlation between radiologic structural abnormalities and clinical  symptoms in low back pain patients is poor. There is an unmet clinical need to image inflammation in pain conditions to aid diagnosis and guide treatment. Ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticle, is clinically used to treat iron deficiency anemia and showed promise in imaging tissue inflammation in human. We explored whether ferumoxytol can be used to identify tissue and nerve inflammation in pain conditions in animals and humans. METHODS: Complete Freud's adjuvant (CFA) or saline was injected into mice hind paws to establish an inflammatory pain model. Ferumoxytol (20 mg/kg) was injected intravenously. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to injection and 72 hours postinjection. The changes in the transverse relaxation time (T2) before and after ferumoxytol injection were compared between mice that received CFA vs saline injection. In the human study, we administered ferumoxytol (4 mg/kg) to a human subject with clinical symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy and compared the patient with a healthy subject. RESULTS: Mice that received CFA exhibited tissue inflammation and pain behaviors. The changes in T2 before and after ferumoxytol injection were significantly higher in mice that received CFA vs saline (20.8 ± 3.6 vs 2.2 ± 2.5, P = 0.005). In the human study, ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI identified the nerve root corresponding to the patient's symptoms, but the nerve root was not impinged by structural abnormalities, suggesting the potential superiority of this approach over conventional structural imaging techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI can identify tissue and nerve inflammation and may provide a promising diagnostic tool in assessing pain conditions in humans.

N2  - PURPOSE: MR neurography is known to be useful to evaluate nerve pathology. The  purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with nerve-sheath signal increased with inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of relaxation enhancement imaging (SHINKEI) to distinguish patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) from healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 13 patients with CIDP and five healthy subjects from 2015 to 2017. The T2 relaxation time and the size of the cervical ganglia and roots of the brachial plexus were measured. Statistical analyses were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The T2 relaxation times of the ganglia and roots were longer in patients with CIDP (119.31 ± 35.53 msec and 111.15 ± 33.82 msec) than in healthy subjects (101.42 ± 26.42 msec and 85.29 ± 13.22 msec, P = 0.0007 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The sizes of the ganglia and the roots were larger in patients with CIDP (6.25 ± 1.56 mm and 4.37 ± 1.71 mm) than in healthy subjects (5.59 ± 1.08 mm and 3.50 ± 0.62 mm, P = 0.0114 and P = 0.0014, respectively). ROC analysis revealed that T2 relaxation time of the roots was best at distinguishing CIDP patients from healthy subjects (the area under the curve = 0.748). CONCLUSION: Patients with CIDP could be distinguished from healthy subjects using simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with SHINKEI.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of  susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SW-MRI) for the evaluation of osseous foraminal stenosis (FS) of the cervical spine compared to conventional MRI-sequences, using computed tomography (CT) as a reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with suspected radiculopathy of the cervical spine were prospectively included. CT and MRI data sets were available for all patients. As standard of reference, 280 neuroforamina of the cervical spine, including 58 foraminal stenosis, were identified on sagittal CT images. T1-, T2-, and SW-MRI of the cervical spine were performed. The presence of foraminal stenosis was assessed on sagittal views in all sequences. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and differences in detection rate and severity scoring of foraminal stenosis between the different sequences were tested. CT was used as reference standard for all analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 58 osseous foraminal stenosis could be correctly identified on SW-MR magnitude images. SW-MRI achieved a sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 99.5% for the identification of foraminal stenosis. In comparison, conventional T1-weighted MRI sequences achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 43.1% and 100% respectively. T2-weighted MRI sequences achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 65.5% and 99.1%, respectively. The overall detection rate was significantly (p < 0.05) higher on SW-MRI and there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in severity scoring compared to CT. T1- and T2-weighted MRI underestimated the degree of foraminal stenosis. Intermodality and interobserver agreements were highest for SW-MRI. CONCLUSIONS: SW-MRI enables the reliable detection of osseous foraminal stenosis of the cervical spine in patients with spinal radiculopathy with a higher sensitivity compared to conventional T1- and T2-MRI sequences, with CT as a reference standard. KEY POINTS: • Susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging enables the reliable detection of osseous foraminal stenosis of the cervical spine with CT as a reference standard. • This could be relevant for younger patients in order to prevent unnecessary radiation exposure. • This may also facilitate a one-stop-shop approach and speed up diagnostic work-up.

N2  - MRI is the most important paraclinical measure for assessing and monitoring the  pathologic changes implicated in the onset and progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). Conventional MRI sequences, such as T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced and spin-echo T2-weighted imaging, are unable to provide full details about the degree of inflammation and underlying neurodegenerative changes. Newer nonconventional MRI techniques have the potential to detect clinical impairment, disease progression, accumulation of disability, and the neuroprotective effects of treatment. Unenhanced T1-weighted imaging can reveal hypointense black holes, a measure of chronic neurodegeneration. Two- and three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences allow better identification of cortical lesions. Ultrahigh-field strength MRI has the potential to detect subpial cortical and deep gray matter lesions. Magnetization transfer imaging is increasingly used to characterize the evolution of MS lesions and normal-appearing brain tissue. Evidence suggests that the dynamics of magnetization transfer changes correlate with the extent of demyelination and remyelination. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which provides details on tissue biochemistry, metabolism, and function, also has the capacity to reveal neuroprotective mechanisms. By measuring the motion of water, diffusion imaging can provide information about the orientation, size, and geometry of tissue damage in white and gray matter. Functional MRI may help clarify the brain's plasticity-dependent compensatory mechanisms in patients with MS. High-resolution microautoradiography and new contrast agents are proving to be sensitive means for characterizing molecular markers of disease activity, such as activated microglia and macrophages. Optical coherence tomography, a new research technique, makes it possible to investigate relevant physiologic systems that provide accurate measures of tissue changes secondary to the MS disease process. Although detecting the status of neuronal integrity using MRI techniques continues to improve, a "gold standard" model remains to be established.

N2  - High-resolution ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the two  imaging methods of choice for the study of peripheral nerves. The many advances that have been made in recent years, either by US or MR imaging, including diffusion tensor imaging and tractography, offer new perspectives for the assessment of many pathological processes affecting peripheral nerves such as entrapment syndromes, tumors and tumor-like lesions, and traumatic disorders. Most of these improvements have especially increased the spatial resolution of nerve imaging. US and MR imaging are complementary, each having advantages and disadvantages. Tractography is still emerging in the musculoskeletal field, particularly for the analysis of peripheral nerves, but this technique seems promising.

N2  - The median nerve is one of the most commonly affected peripheral nerves in various  pathologies such as entrapment syndromes or transections. The diagnostic procedures applied in these situations are electromyography, physical examination methods, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used mostly in imaging the central nervous system (CNS) to visualize white matter tracts. Several studies have shown the clinical applications of DTI in neuronal disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and CNS tumors. Recently, peripheral nerves have been visualized with DTI. Also, in several pathologies such as carpal tunnel syndrome and transection of the median nerve, on postoperative follow-up anisotropy indexes were shown to be affected. However, new studies with larger series are needed.

N2  - PURPOSE: Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is seen in up to 75% of  treated cancer patients and can drastically limit their medical management and affect quality of life. Clinical and electrodiagnostic testing for CIPN have many pitfalls. Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used in the evaluation of peripheral nerves. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows promise in the workup of peripheral nerves. In this prospective pilot study, we investigated a possible relationship between DTI and peripheral neuropathy of the ankle and foot in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: Nine cancer patients with and without CIPN were clinically evaluated using vibratory perception threshold (VPT) testing. VPT score of >25Volts defined presence of CIPN. The posterior tibial nerve and branches in both feet were imaged using MRN and DTI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured at the posterior tibial, medial plantar, and lateral plantar nerves. Measurements for the CIPN group were compared to without CIPN by VPT cutoff. Correlations and possible relationships between DTI parameters and CIPN were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 16feet of 9 enrolled patients were imaged (9feet with CIPN and 7feet without CIPN). Average age was 60.6 ± 13.4 years (range: 33-74). Posterior tibial nerve ADC values were significantly lower than the medial plantar nerve ADC values in all feet (F = 3.50, P = 0.04). We found a correlation with FA and ADC values at specific nerve locations with CIPN, with the left medial plantar nerve FA value and left lateral plantar nerve ADC value demonstrating the strongest positive correlations (0.73 and 0.62, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The use of DTI for assessing CIPN is challenging but promising. This pilot study provides preliminary data showing correlations between FA and ADC measurements with CIPN and potential utility of DTI as a predictive marker of onset and severity of CIPN in the ankle and foot, which could aid in preventive strategies. Larger, prospective DTI studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: MRN with DTI shows promising results as a potential predictive marker of CIPN in the ankle and foot.

N2  - PURPOSE: To develop an in-vivo imaging method for the measurement of  dorsal-root-ganglia-(DRG) perfusion, to establish its normal values in patients without known peripheral nerve disorders or radicular pain syndromes and to determine the physiological spatial perfusion pattern within the DRG. METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. 46 (24 female, 22 male, mean age 46.0±15.2years) subjects without known peripheral neuropathies or pain syndromes were examined by a 3Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom VERIO or TRIO, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) with a VIBE (Volume-Interpolated-Breathhold-Examination) dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) T1-w-sequence (TR/TE 3.3/1.11ms; 24 slices; voxel resolution 1.3×1.3×3.0mm(3)) covered the pelvis from the upper plate of the 5th lumbar vertebra to the 2nd sacral vertebra. Transfer-constant (K(trans)) and interstitial-volume-fraction (interstitial-leakage-fraction, Ve) were modeled for the DRG and spinal nerve by applying the Tofts-model. Statistical analyses included pairwise comparisons of L5/S1 DRG vs. spinal nerve. Furthermore, distinct physiological zones within the S1 DRG were compared (cell body rich area (CBRA) vs. nerve fiber rich area (NFRA)). RESULTS: DRG showed a significantly increased permeability compared to spinal nerve (K(trans) 3.8±1.5 10(-3)/min vs. 1.6±0.9 10(-3)/min, p-value: <0.001) combined with an increased interstitial leakage of contrast agent into the extravascular-extracellular-space (Ve 38.1±19.2% vs. 17.3±9.9%, p-value: <0.001). Parameters showed no statistically significant difference on DRG-level (L5 vs. S1; p-value: 0.62 (K(trans)); 0.17 (Ve)) and -side (left vs. right; p-value: 0.25 (K(trans)); 0.79 (Ve)). Female gender was associated with a significantly increased permeability (K(trans) female 4.3±1.4 10(-3)/min vs. male 3.4±0.9 10(-3)/min, p-value: <0.05) but no statistically significant differences in interstitial leakage (Ve female 40.1±14,1% vs. male 34.5±17.4%, p-value: 0.24). DRG showed distinct spatial distribution patterns of perfusion: K(trans) and Ve were significantly higher in the CBRA than in the NFRA (K(trans) 4.4±1.8 10(-3)/min vs. 1.7±1.2 10(-3)/min, p-value: <0.001 and Ve 40.9±21.3% vs. 15.1±11.7%, p-value: <0.001). CONCLUSION: Non-invasive and in-vivo measurement of human DRG perfusion by MRI is a feasible technique. DRG show substantially higher permeability and interstitial leakage than spinal nerves. Even distinct physiological perfusion patterns for different microstructural compartments could be observed within the DRG. The technique may become particularly useful for future research on the poorly understood human sensory neuropathies and pain syndromes.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether the intratemporal facial nerve  could be delineated on 9.4 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using T2-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI using a b value of 3000 and an isotropic resolution of 0.4 mm(3) on a 9.4 T MRI scanner was performed on a whole-block celloidin-embedded cadaveric temporal bone specimen of a 1-year-old infant with normal temporal bones. The labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid segments of the facial nerve and the chorda tympani nerve were readily depicted on DTI. Therefore, DTI performed using a high b value on a high-field strength MRI scanner could help evaluate the intratemporal facial nerve in whole temporal bone ex vivo specimens.

N2  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) adds functional information to morphological  magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in the assessment of the brachial nerve plexus. To determine the most appropriate pulse sequence in scan times suited for diagnostic imaging in clinical routine, we compared image quality between simultaneous multi-slice readout-segmented (rs-DTI) and conventional single-shot (ss-DTI) echo-planar imaging techniques. METHODS: Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved study including 10 healthy volunteers. The supraclavicular brachial plexus, covering the nerve roots and trunks from C5 to C7, was imaged on both sides with rs-DTI and ss-DTI. Both sequences were acquired in scan times <7 min with b-values of 900 s/mm(2) and with isotropic spatial resolution. RESULTS: In rs-DTI image, the overall quality was significantly better and distortion artifacts were significantly lower (P = 0.001-0.002 and P = 0.001-0.002, respectively) for both readers. In ss-DTI, a trend toward lower degree of ghosting and motion artifacts was elicited (reader 1, P = 0.121; reader 2, P = 0.264). No significant differences between the two DTI techniques were found for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (P ≥ 0.475, P ≥ 0.624, and P ≥ 0.169, respectively). Interreader agreement for all examined parameters and all sequences ranged from intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.064 to 0.905 and Kappa 0.40 to 0.851. CONCLUSION: Incomparable acquisition times rs-DTI showed higher image quality and less distortion artifacts than ss-DTI. The trend toward a higher degree of ghosting and motion artifacts in rs-DTI did not deteriorate image quality to a significant degree. Thus, rs-DTI should be considered for functional MRN of the brachial plexus.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To study disease mechanisms in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the median and ulnar nerves. METHODS: We enrolled ten MMN patients, ten patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ten healthy controls (HCs). Patients underwent MRI (in a prone position) and nerve conduction studies. DTI and fat-suppressed T2-weighted scans of the forearms were performed on a 3.0T MRI scanner. Fibre tractography of the median and ulnar nerves was performed to extract diffusion parameters: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity. Cross-sectional areas (CSA) were measured on T2-weighted scans. RESULTS: Forty-five out of 60 arms were included in the analysis. AD was significantly lower in MMN patients (2.20 ± 0.12 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s) compared to ALS patients (2.31 ± 0.17 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; p < 0.05) and HCs (2.31± 0.17 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; p < 0.05). Segmental analysis showed significant restriction of AD, RD and MD (p < 0.005) in the proximal third of the nerves. CSA was significantly larger in MMN patients compared to ALS patients and HCs (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Thickening of nerves is compatible with changes in the myelin sheath structure, whereas lowered AD values suggest axonal dysfunction. These findings suggest that myelin and axons are diffusely involved in MMN pathogenesis. KEY POINTS: • Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging provides quantitative information about multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). • Diffusion tensor imaging allows non-invasive evaluation of the forearm nerves in MMN. • Nerve thickening and lowered diffusion parameters suggests myelin and axonal changes. • This study can help to provide insight into pathological mechanisms of MMN.

N2  - OBJECTIVE Total tumor excision with the preservation of neurological function and  quality of life is the goal of modern-day vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery. Postoperative facial nerve (FN) paralysis is a devastating complication of VS surgery. Determining the course of the FN in relation to a VS preoperatively is invaluable to the neurosurgeon and is likely to enhance surgical safety with respect to FN function. Diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking (DTI-FT) technology is slowly gaining traction as a viable tool for preoperative FN visualization in patients with VS. METHODS A systematic review of the literature in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and those studies that preoperatively localized the FN in relation to a VS using the DTI-FT technique and verified those preoperative FN tracking results by using microscopic observation and electrophysiological monitoring during microsurgery were included. A pooled analysis of studies was performed to calculate the surgical concordance rate (accuracy) of DTI-FT technology for FN localization. RESULTS Fourteen studies included 234 VS patients (male/female ratio 1:1.4, age range 17-75 years) who had undergone preoperative DTI-FT for FN identification. The mean tumor size among the studies ranged from 29 to 41.3 mm. Preoperative DTI-FT could not visualize the FN tract in 8 patients (3.4%) and its findings could not be verified in 3 patients (1.2%), were verified but discordant in 18 patients (7.6%), and were verified and concordant in 205 patients (87.1%). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative DTI-FT for FN identification is a useful adjunct in the surgical planning for large VSs (> 2.5 cm). A pooled analysis showed that DTI-FT successfully identifies the complete FN course in 96.6% of VSs (226 of 234 cases) and that FN identification by DTI-FT is accurate in 90.6% of cases (205 of 226 cases). Larger studies with DTI-FT-integrated neuronavigation are required to look at the direct benefit offered by this specific technique in preserving postoperative FN function.

N2  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may be helpful in assessing optic pathway  integrity as a marker for treatment in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients with optic gliomas (OG). However, susceptibility artifacts are common in typical single-shot echo planar imaging (ssDTI). A readout-segmented multi-shot EPI technique (rsDTI) was utilized to minimize susceptibility distortions of the skull base and improve quantitative metrics. METHODS: Healthy controls, children with NF1 without OG, and NF1 with OG ± visual symptoms were included. All subjects were scanned with both rsDTI and ssDTI sequences sequentially. Diffusion metrics and deterministic fiber tracking were calculated. Tract count, volume, and length were also compared by a two-factor mixed ANOVA. RESULTS: Five healthy controls, 7 NF1 children without OG, and 12 NF1 children with OG were imaged. Six OG patients had visual symptoms. Four subjects had no detectable optic pathway fibers on ssDTI due to susceptibility, for which rsDTI was able to delineate. Tract count (p < 0.001), tract volume (p < 0.001), and FA (P < 0.001) were significantly higher for rsDTI versus ssDTI for all subjects. MD (p < 0.001) and RD (p < 0.001) were significantly lower for rsDTI vs ssDTI. Finally, MD, AD, and RD had a significantly lower difference in NF1 children with visual symptoms compared to NF1 children without visual symptoms only on ssDTI scans. CONCLUSION: DTI with readout-segmented multi-shot EPI technique can better visualize the optic pathway and allow more confident measurements of anisotropy in NF1 patients. This is shown by a significant increase in FA, tract count, and volume with rsDTI versus ssDTI.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate magnetization transfer (MT) effects as a new source of  contrast for imaging and tracking of peripheral foot nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two sets of 3D spoiled gradient-echo images acquired with and without a saturation pulse were used to generate MT ratio (MTR) maps of 260 μm in-plane resolution for eight volunteers at 3T. Scan parameters were adjusted to minimize signal loss due to T2 dephasing, and a dedicated coil was used to improve the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio of small voxels. Resulting MTR values in foot nerves were compared with those in surrounding muscle tissue. RESULTS: Average MTR values for muscle (45.5 ± 1.4%) and nerve (21.4 ± 3.1%) were significantly different (P < 0.0001). In general, the difference in MTR values was sufficiently large to allow for intensity-based segmentation and tracking of foot nerves in individual subjects. This procedure was termed MT-based 3D visualization. CONCLUSION: The MTR serves as a new source of contrast for imaging of peripheral foot nerves and provides a means for high spatial resolution tracking of these structures. The proposed methodology is directly applicable on standard clinical MR scanners and could be applied to systemic pathologies, such as diabetes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate functional and morphometric magnetic resonance neurography of  the dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve segments in patients with Fabry painful neuropathy. METHODS: In this prospective study, the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and proximal peripheral nerve segments of the lower extremity were examined in 11 male patients with Fabry disease by a standardized 3T magnetic resonance neurography protocol. Volumes of L3 to S2 dorsal root ganglia, perfusion parameters of L5-S1 dorsal root ganglia and the spinal nerve L5, and the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic nerve were compared to healthy controls. RESULTS: Dorsal root ganglia of patients with Fabry disease were symmetrically enlarged by 78% (L3), 94% (L4), 122% (L5), 115% (S1), and 119% (S2) (p < 0.001). In addition, permeability of the blood-tissue interface was decreased by 53% (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the peripheral zone of the dorsal root ganglion containing the cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons (p < 0.001). Spinal nerve permeability showed no difference between patients with Fabry disease and controls (p = 0.7). The sciatic nerve of patients with Fabry disease at the thigh level showed an increase in cross-sectional area by 48% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Fabry disease have severely enlarged dorsal root ganglia with dysfunctional perfusion. This may be due to glycolipid accumulation in the dorsal root ganglia mediating direct neurotoxic effects and decreased neuronal blood supply. These alterations were less pronounced in peripheral nerve segments. Thus, the dorsal root ganglion might play a key pathophysiologic role in the development of neuropathy and pain in Fabry disease.

N2  - PURPOSE: We investigate the importance of high gradient-amplitude and high slew-rate  on oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) diffusion imaging for human brain imaging and evaluate human brain imaging with OGSE on the MAGNUS head-gradient insert (200 mT/m amplitude and 500 T/m/s slew rate). METHODS: Simulations with cosine-modulated and trapezoidal-cosine OGSE at various gradient amplitudes and slew rates were performed. Six healthy subjects were imaged with the MAGNUS gradient at 3T with OGSE at frequencies up to 100 Hz and b = 450 s/mm(2) . Comparisons were made against standard pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) diffusion in vivo and in an isotropic diffusion phantom. RESULTS: Simulations show that to achieve high frequency and b-value simultaneously for OGSE, high gradient amplitude, high slew rates, and high peripheral nerve stimulation limits are required. A strong linear trend for increased diffusivity (mean: 8-19%, radial: 9-27%, parallel: 8-15%) was observed in normal white matter with OGSE (20 Hz to 100 Hz) as compared to PGSE. Linear fitting to frequency provided excellent correlation, and using a short-range disorder model provided radial long-term diffusivities of D(∞,MD) = 911 ± 72 µm(2) /s, D(∞,PD) = 1519 ± 164 µm(2) /s, and D(∞,RD) = 640 ± 111 µm(2) /s and correlation lengths of l(c) (,MD) = 0.802 ± 0.156 µm, l(c) (,PD) = 0.837 ± 0.172 µm, and l(c) (,RD) = 0.780 ± 0.174 µm. Diffusivity changes with OGSE frequency were negligible in the phantom, as expected. CONCLUSION: The high gradient amplitude, high slew rate, and high peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds of the MAGNUS head-gradient enables OGSE acquisition for in vivo human brain imaging.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic neuropathy is the commonest chronic disabling complication of  diabetes which may lead to amputation and compromising patient's quality of life. It is characterized by pain, sensation loss associated with neural edema. Diffusion tensor imaging parameter i.e. fraction anisotropy determines the free water proton diffusion in the healthy nerve. Since the diabetes leads to altered mechanosensitivity of the posterior tibial nerve thereby, might interferes with the water molecules movement. Therefore the present clinical trial will provide the evidence of improving the diffusion tensor imaging in the diabetic neuropathy directly by targeting the nerve through nerve mobilization treatment. METHODS: Participants with Type II Diabetes Mellitus induced peripheral neuropathy will be selected randomly on the basis of eligibility criteria and informed consent will be taken. Participants will be recruited into three groups. Group A (experimental group A) will receive neural mobilization technique, Group B (experimental group B) will receive conventional therapy and Group C (control group) will receive sham treatment for 3 weeks. MRI technique, Visual analogue scale and neuropathy specific quality of life questionnaire will be used as assessment tools. Assessment will be taken at baseline and post intervention. CONCLUSION: this clinical trial will provide the evidence of efficacy of nerve mobilization in determining the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes in the posterior tibial nerve in patients with diabetic neuropathy. This trial will also be the first one in itself to look at the treatment induced DTI changes in the peripheral nerve. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2019/06/019552).

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing  peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. We assessed the changes in the DTI parameters and histological analyses after nerve injury to examine degeneration and regeneration in the rat sciatic nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 16 rats were randomly divided into two groups: group P (permanently crushed; n = 7) and group T (temporally crushed; n = 9). Serial MRI of the right leg was performed before the operation, and then performed at the timepoints of 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the crush injury. The changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (λ(∥)), and radial diffusivity (λ(⟂)) were quantified. For histological analyses, the number of axons and the myelinated axon areas were quantified. RESULTS: Decreased FA and increased λ(⟂) were observed in the degenerative phase, and increased FA and decreased λ(⟂) were observed in the regenerative phase. The changes in FA and λ(⟂) were strongly correlated with histological changes, including axonal and myelin regeneration. CONCLUSION: DTI parameters, especially λ(⟂) , can be good indicators for peripheral nerve regeneration and can be applied as noninvasive diagnostic tools for a variety of neurological diseases.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathies refer to a group of disorders in which there is  damage to the nerves of the peripheral nervous system. Electrophysiologic studies are the main stay for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies. However, direct visualization of the nerves is possible with exact localization of site of disease with high-resolution ultrasonography (USG) and 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, and newer magnetic resonance (MR) sequences. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study including 55 patients and 64 nerves with upper limb peripheral neuropathies. All patients included underwent high-resolution focused USG of the nerves and MR neurography. A nerve conduction velocity study was performed for reference. RESULTS: The diagnostic confidence of the turbo spin echo T2-weighted (T2W) MR sequence was seen to be highest, with a sensitivity of 95.31%, whereas it was 81.25% for USG. Continuity of the nerve in patients with traumatic neuropathy was seen in 65.7% and 62.86% (22/35) nerves on MRI and USG, respectively. T1-weighted and T2W MR sequences were seen to be equally effective in establishing the continuity of the nerve. Increase in the caliber/thickening was seen in 77% of cases on MRI and 73.8% of cases on USG. Neuroma formation was seen equally on both MR and USG in 60.66%. We consistently found low fractional anisotropy (FA) values at the site of disease. CONCLUSIONS: USG is a sensitive technique to diagnose peripheral neuropathies and it should be used as a screening modality for focused MR to be performed later. Turbo spin echo T2W fast spin has the highest sensitivity to identify nerve disease and is comparable with nerve conduction studies. Among the newer sequences, diffusion tensor imaging should be performed to increase diagnostic confidence.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated diffusion tensor imaging tractography  of cranial nerves (CNs). Spatial and angular resolution, however, is limited with this modality. A substantial improvement in image resolution can be achieved with high-angle diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and atlas-based fiber tracking to provide detailed trajectories of CNs. OBJECTIVE: To use high-definition fiber tractography to identify CNs in healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors. METHODS: Five neurologically healthy adults and 3 patients with brain tumors were scanned with diffusion spectrum imaging that allowed high-angular-resolution fiber tracking. In addition, a 488-subject diffusion magnetic resonance imaging template constructed from the Human Connectome Project data was used to conduct atlas space fiber tracking of CNs. RESULTS: The cisternal portions of most CNs were tracked and visualized in each healthy subject and in atlas fiber tracking. The entire optic radiation, medial longitudinal fasciculus, spinal trigeminal nucleus/tract, petroclival portion of the abducens nerve, and intrabrainstem portion of the facial nerve from the root exit zone to the adjacent abducens nucleus were identified. This suggested that the high-angular-resolution fiber tracking was able to distinguish the facial nerve from the vestibulocochlear nerve complex. The tractography clearly visualized CNs displaced by brain tumors. These tractography findings were confirmed intraoperatively. CONCLUSION: Using high-angular-resolution fiber tracking and atlas-based fiber tracking, we were able to identify all CNs in unprecedented detail. This implies its potential in localization of CNs during surgical planning.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the cross-sectional area of the  anconeus epitrochlearis muscle (AEM), cubital tunnel, and ulnar nerve with the elbow in extension in patients with and without ulnar neuropathy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, level IV review of elbow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Elbow MRI studies of 32 patients with an AEM (26 men and 6 women, aged 18-60 years), 32 randomly selected patients without an AEM (aged 16-71 years), and 32 patients with clinical ulnar neuritis (22 men and 10 women, aged 24-76 years) were reviewed. We evaluated the ulnar nerve cross-sectional area proximal to, within, and distal to the cubital tunnel; AEM cross-sectional area; and cubital tunnel cross-sectional area. RESULTS: We found no significant difference in the nerve caliber between patients with and without an AEM. No correlation was found between the AEM cross-sectional area and ulnar nerve cross-sectional area within the cubital tunnel (r = 0.14). The mean cubital tunnel cross-sectional area was larger in patients with an AEM. Only 4 of the 32 patients with an AEM had findings of ulnar neuritis on MRI. Of the 32 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ulnar neuritis, only 2 had an AEM. CONCLUSIONS: With the elbow in extension, the presence or cross-sectional area of an AEM does not correlate with the area of the ulnar nerve or cubital tunnel. Only a small number of individuals with MRI evidence of an AEM had clinical evidence of ulnar neuropathy. Likewise, MRI evidence of an AEM was found in only a small number of individuals with clinical evidence of ulnar neuropathy.

N2  - The emergence of diffusion, structural, and functional neuroimaging methods has  enabled major multi-site efforts to map the human connectome, which has heretofore been defined as containing all neural connections in the central nervous system (CNS). However, these efforts are not structured to examine the richness and complexity of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which arguably forms the (neglected) rest of the connectome. Despite increasing interest in an atlas of the spinal cord (SC) and PNS which is simultaneously stereotactic, interactive, electronically dissectible, scalable, population-based and deformable, little attention has thus far been devoted to this task of critical importance. Nevertheless, the atlasing of these complete neural structures is essential for neurosurgical planning, neurological localization, and for mapping those components of the human connectome located outside of the CNS. Here we recommend a modification to the definition of the human connectome to include the SC and PNS, and argue for the creation of an inclusive atlas to complement current efforts to map the brain's human connectome, to enhance clinical education, and to assist progress in neuroscience research. In addition to providing a critical overview of existing neuroimaging techniques, image processing methodologies and algorithmic advances which can be combined for the creation of a full connectome atlas, we outline a blueprint for ultimately mapping the entire human nervous system and, thereby, for filling a critical gap in our scientific knowledge of neural connectivity.

N2  - PURPOSE: Recently, lateral interbody fusion (LIF) has become more prevalent, and  evaluation of lumbar nerves has taken on new importance. We report on the assessment of anatomical relationships between lumbar nerves and vertebral bodies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Fifty patients with degenerative lumbar disease and ten healthy subjects underwent DTI. In patients with lumbar degenerative disease, we studied nerve courses with patients in the supine positions and with hips flexed. In healthy subjects, we evaluated nerve courses in three different positions: supine with hips flexed (the standard position for MRI); supine with hips extended; and the right lateral decubitus position with hips flexed. In conjunction with tractography from L3 to L5 using T2-weighted sagittal imaging, the vertebral body anteroposterior span was divided into four equally wide zones, with six total zones defined, including an anterior and a posterior zone (zone A, zones 1-4, zone P). We used this to characterize nerve courses at disc levels L3/4, L4/5, and L5/S1. RESULTS: In patients with degenerative lumbar disease, in the supine position with hips flexed, all lumbar nerve roots were located posterior to the vertebral body centers in L3/4 and L4/5. In healthy individuals, the L3/4 nerve courses were displaced forward in hips extended compared with the standard position, whereas in the lateral decubitus position, the L4/5 and L5/S nerve courses were displaced posteriorly compared with the standard position. CONCLUSIONS: The L3/4 and L4/5 nerve roots are located posterior to the vertebral body center. These were found to be offset to the rear when the hip is flexed or the lateral decubitus position is assumed. The present study is the first to elucidate changes in the course of the lumbar nerves as this varies by position. The lateral decubitus position or the position supine with hips flexed may be useful for avoiding nerve damage in a direct lateral transpsoas approach. Preoperative DTI seems to be useful in evaluating the lumbar nerve course as it relates anatomically to the vertebral body.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the applicability of nerve ultrasound and magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). METHODS: We systematically examined several nerves with ultrasound and the lumbar roots and tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa of nine CIDP patients with MRI additionally to the nerve conduction studies. RESULTS: Patients with overall disability sum score (ODSS) 2-3 were characterised by normal fascicular structure in MRI and ultrasound. Patients with higher ODSS showed isolated enlarged fascicles and increased cross sectional area (CSA) of the peripheral nerves and of the diameter of the cauda equina and L5 root, whereas two of them showed atrophic fascicles in both imaging techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Nerve ultrasound and MRI findings show the same morphological fascicle alterations in peripheral nerves in correlation to ODSS. Nerve ultrasound as an affordable tool, easy and quick to perform, could replace MRI in daily routine for monitoring peripheral nerve morphology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid injections are a popular technique for carpal tunnel  syndrome (CTS) treatment and are believed to provide rapid symptom relief. PURPOSE: To use magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI) to determine the association between diffusion values of the median nerve (MN) at several anatomic locations and symptom relief in patients with CTS following corticosteroid injection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MR-DTI was performed on 15 wrists of 12 patients with CTS before and two weeks after ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections. We recorded the patients' clinical data including sex, age, side of injection, satisfaction, and symptom relief. Satisfaction and symptom relief were rated using a Likert scale and the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ) scale. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the MN at the levels of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), pisiform bone, and hamate bone were determined. RESULTS: All patients had ≥50% satisfaction on the injection side. In comparison with baseline values, post-injection ADC was significantly lower ( P = 0.001) but FA was not significantly higher ( P = 0.11) at the pisiform bone level on the injected wrists. At the DRUJ and hamate bone levels, no obvious inter-scan change in FA and ADC ( P > 0.05) was observed. The decrease in ADC at the pisiform bone level strongly correlated with the decrease in BCTQ scores (r = 0.628; P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Symptom relief in patients with CTS receiving corticosteroid injection is related to the change in ADC of the median nerve at the level of the pisiform bone, as determined using MR-DTI.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We studied whether distal peripheral nerves could be imaged using  quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a 3-T MRI scanner, and visualized using tractography. METHODS: Altogether 6 healthy subjects were studied. The diffusion was quantified with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and the direction of main diffusivity was visualized with color-coded orientation maps and tractography. RESULTS: We present the first DTI and tractography results of human distal peripheral nerves. The courses of median, ulnar, and radial nerves in the upper limb and of tibial and peroneal nerves in the lower limb were first analyzed quantifying ADC and FA, and then visualized in 3D with tractography. Tractography illustrated nicely the 3D courses of both upper and lower limb nerves which were reliably distinguished from the surrounding muscle tissue and ligaments. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative DTI and tractography can be used to image and visualize distal peripheral nerves. SIGNIFICANCE: DTI is a quantitative method that could provide useful information for the diagnosis and follow-up of nerve lesions, entrapments, and regeneration. Peripheral nerves as well-delineated structures also containing abundant branching into bundles of different diameters, could be used as 'living phantoms' for testing and validating different tractography methods.

N2  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) characterises tissue  microstructure and provides proxy measures of myelination, axon diameter, fibre density and organisation. This may be valuable in the assessment of the roots of the brachial plexus in health and disease. Therefore, there is a need to define the normal DTI values. METHODS: The literature was systematically searched for studies of asymptomatic adults who underwent DTI of the brachial plexus. Participant characteristics, scanning protocols, and measurements of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of each spinal root were extracted by two independent review authors. Generalised linear modelling was used to estimate the effect of experimental conditions on the FA and MD. Meta-analysis of root-level estimates was performed using Cohen's method with random effects. RESULTS: Nine articles, describing 316 adults (1:1 male:female) of mean age 35 years (SD 6) were included. Increments of ten diffusion sensitising gradient directions reduced the mean FA by 0.01 (95% CI 0.01, 0.03). Each year of life reduced the mean MD by 0.03 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s (95% CI 0.01, 0.04). At 3-T, the pooled mean FA of the roots was 0.36 (95% CI 0.34, 0.38; I (2) 98%). The pooled mean MD of the roots was 1.51 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s (95% CI 1.45, 1.56; I (2) 99%). CONCLUSIONS: The FA and MD of the roots of the brachial plexus vary according to experimental conditions and participant factors. We provide summary estimates of the normative values in different conditions which may be valuable to researchers and clinicians alike.

N2  - PURPOSE: To perform in vivo isotropic-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of  lumbosacral and sciatic nerves with a phase-navigated diffusion-prepared (DP) 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) acquisition and modified reconstruction incorporating intershot phase-error correction and to investigate the improvement on image quality and diffusion quantification with the proposed phase correction. METHODS: Phase-navigated DP 3D TSE included magnitude stabilizers to minimize motion and eddy-current effects on the signal magnitude. Phase navigation of motion-induced phase errors was introduced before readout in 3D TSE. DTI of lower back nerves was performed in vivo using 3D TSE and single-shot echo planar imaging (ss-EPI) in 13 subjects. Diffusion data were phase-corrected per k(z) plane with respect to T(2) -weighted data. The effects of motion-induced phase errors on DTI quantification was assessed for 3D TSE and compared with ss-EPI. RESULTS: Non-phase-corrected 3D TSE resulted in artifacts in diffusion-weighted images and overestimated DTI parameters in the sciatic nerve (mean diffusivity [MD] = 2.06 ± 0.45). Phase correction of 3D TSE DTI data resulted in reductions in all DTI parameters (MD = 1.73 ± 0.26) of statistical significance (P ≤ 0.001) and in closer agreement with ss-EPI DTI parameters (MD = 1.62 ± 0.21). CONCLUSION: DP 3D TSE with phase correction allows distortion-free isotropic diffusion imaging of lower back nerves with robustness to motion-induced artifacts and DTI quantification errors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While neuroimaging in ALS has gained unprecedented momentum in recent  years, little progress has been made in the development of viable diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring markers. OBJECTIVES: To identify and discuss the common pitfalls in ALS imaging studies and to reflect on optimal study designs based on pioneering studies. METHODS: A "PubMed"-based literature search on ALS was performed based on neuroimaging-related keywords. Study limitations were systematically reviewed and classified so that stereotypical trends could be identified. RESULTS: Common shortcomings, such as relatively small sample sizes, statistically underpowered study designs, lack of disease controls, poorly characterised patient cohorts and a large number of conflicting studies, remain a significant challenge to the field. Imaging data of ALS continue to be interpreted at a group-level, as opposed to meaningful individual-patient inferences. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic, critical review of ALS imaging has identified stereotypical shortcomings, the lessons of which should be considered in the design of future prospective MRI studies. At a time when large multicentre studies are underway a candid discussion of these factors is particularly timely.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a novel magnetization  transfer ratio (MTR) MRI assay of the proximal sciatic nerve (SN), which is inaccessible via current tools for assessing peripheral nerves, and (2) to evaluate the resulting MTR values as a potential biomarker of myelin content changes in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases. METHODS: MTR was measured in the SN of patients with CMT type 1A (CMT1A, n = 10), CMT type 2A (CMT2A, n = 3), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (n = 3), and healthy controls (n = 21). Additional patients without a genetically confirmed subtype (n = 4), but whose family histories and electrophysiologic tests were consistent with CMT, were also included. The relationship between MTR and clinical neuropathy scores was assessed, and the interscan and inter-rater reliability of MTR was estimated. RESULTS: Mean volumetric MTR values were significantly decreased in the SN of patients with CMT1A (33.8 ± 3.3 percent units) and CMT2A (31.5 ± 1.9 percent units) relative to controls (37.2 ± 2.3 percent units). A significant relationship between MTR and disability scores was also detected (p = 0.01 for genetically confirmed patients only, p = 0.04 for all patients). From interscan and inter-rater reliability analyses, proximal nerve MTR values were repeatable at the slicewise and mean volumetric levels. CONCLUSIONS: MTR measurements may be a viable biomarker of proximal nerve pathology in patients with CMT.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate microstructural cerebral changes in children with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) based on T(2) relaxation time measurements at 3Tesla. METHODS: From our dataset of pediatric MRI examinations at 3T 19 pediatric NF1 patients (1.9-14.3 years of age, 9 girls, 10 boys) were retrospectively selected and compared with the previously published group of 44 healthy children (0-16 years of age). MRI examination included a triple echo TSE sequence as basis for T(2) maps. T(2) relaxation times were measured in 37 brain regions. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, T(2) relaxation times had the tendency to be increased by 1.01% (GM) to 11.85% (dentate nucleus) for NF1 patients. Only in posterior limb of the internal capsule and parietooccipital white matter values were reduced. No differences were observed between both hemispheres. Overall, no strong evidence supporting a difference between NF1 patients with and without optic glioma or with normal and impaired neuropsychological development was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Using T(2) relaxation times it was possible to describe measurable microstructural differences in multiple brain regions between NF1 patients and healthy children regardless of whether signal abnormalities were visible on conventional images.

N2  - Trigeminal neuralgia, painful trigeminal neuropathy, and painful temporomandibular  disorders (TMDs) are chronic orofacial pain conditions that are thought to have fundamentally different etiologies. Trigeminal neuralgia and neuropathy are thought to arise from damage to or pressure on the trigeminal nerve, whereas TMD results primarily from peripheral nociceptor activation. This study sought to assess the volume and microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in these 3 conditions. In 9 neuralgia, 18 neuropathy, 20 TMD, and 26 healthy controls, the trigeminal root entry zone was selected on high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and the volume (mm(3)) calculated. Additionally, using diffusion-tensor images (DTIs), the mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values of the trigeminal nerve root were calculated. Trigeminal neuralgia patients displayed a significant (47%) decrease in nerve volume but no change in DTI values. Conversely, trigeminal neuropathy subjects displayed a significant (40%) increase in nerve volume but again no change in DTI values. In contrast, TMD subjects displayed no change in volume or DTI values. The data suggest that the changes occurring within the trigeminal nerve are not uniform in all orofacial pain conditions. These structural and volume changes may have implications in diagnosis and management of different forms of chronic orofacial pain. PERSPECTIVE: This study reveals that neuropathic orofacial pain conditions are associated with changes in trigeminal nerve volume, whereas non-neuropathic orofacial pain is not associated with any change in nerve volume.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively describe the MRI fat infiltration pattern of muscle  degeneration in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type 1A (CMT1A) disease and to look for correlations with clinical variables. METHODS: MRI fat fraction was assessed in lower-limb musculature of patients with CMT1A and healthy controls. More particularly, 14 muscle compartments were selected at leg and thigh levels and for proximal, distal, and medial slices. Muscle fat infiltration profile was determined quantitatively in each muscle compartment and along the entire volume of acquisition to determine a length-dependent gradient of fat infiltration. Clinical impairment was evaluated with muscle strength measurements and CMT Examination Scores (CMTESs). RESULTS: A total of 16 patients with CMT1A were enrolled and compared to 11 healthy controls. Patients with CMT1A showed a larger muscle fat fraction at leg and thigh levels with a proximal-to-distal gradient. At the leg level, the largest fat infiltration was quantified in the anterior and lateral compartments. CMTES was correlated with fat fraction, especially in the anterior compartment of leg muscles. Strength of plantar flexion was also correlated with fat fraction of the posterior compartments of leg muscles. CONCLUSION: On the basis of quantitative MRI measurements combined with a dedicated segmentation method, muscle fat infiltration quantified in patients with CMT1A disclosed a length-dependent peroneal-type pattern of fat infiltration and was correlated to main clinical variables. Quantification of fat fraction at different levels of the leg anterior compartment might be of interest in future clinical trials.

We identified correlations between the ischiofemoral space (IFS), quadratus femoris space (QFS), femoral version angle (FVA) and cervicodiaphyseal angle (CDA). METHODS: This study involved a retrospective search of a database of consecutive reports of adult hip MRI examinations carried out between January and September 2016. Patients with a medical history likely to affect pelvic and hip morphometry were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 137 adult patients were enrolled in the study (45.3% males and 54.7% females), with a mean age of 50.16 ± 13.87 years. The mean IFS was 20.88 ± 5.96 mm, mean QFS was 15.2 ± 6.18 mm, mean FVA was 12.43 ± 6.98, and mean CDA was 121.27 ± 4.6°. The IFS measurements were significantly correlated with femoral measurements (p = 0.025). These visible differences showed a slight negative relationship (-0.191), and females had a smaller distance between these anatomical structures than males (p < 0.001). Females had a significantly smaller QFS than males (12.42 ± 5.94 vs 18.73 ± 4.48 mm, p = 0.000). There was a small but significant positive relationship between CDA and FVA (p = 0.022), with a correlation coefficient of 0.195. CONCLUSION: A higher FVA was correlated with a smaller IFS. Furthermore, an increase in the CDA appeared in tandem with an increase in the FVA. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: A single conventional MRI sequence can alert us to how anatomical factors could predispose individuals to a decrease in IFS.

N2  - Measurements of T2 relaxation times in tissues have provided a unique, noninvasive  method to investigate the microenvironment of water molecules in vivo. As more clinical imaging is performed at higher field strengths, tissue relaxation times need to be reassessed in order to optimize tissue contrast. The purpose of this study was to investigate the water proton T2 relaxation time in human median nerve at 7 T. High-resolution images of the wrist were obtained using a home-built dedicated microstrip coil. Gradient echo images provided a good anatomical delineation of the wrist structure, with a clear definition of the median nerve, tendons, bone, and connective tissue within the wrist in an acquisition time of 2 min. Measurements of the T2 relaxation time were performed with a spin echo imaging sequence. The T2 relaxation time of the median nerve was 18.3 +/- 1.9 ms, which is significantly shorter than the T2 measured in previous studies performed at 1.5 T and 3 T. Further, the T2 relaxation time of the median nerve is shorter than the T2 relaxation time of other tissues, such as brain tissue, at the same field strength. Since the T2 relaxation time of water protons is sensitive to the water microenvironment, relaxation measurements and, in general, a more quantitative magnetic resonance imaging approach might help in detecting and investigating diseases of peripheral nervous system, such as compressive and inflammatory neuropathies, in humans.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is caused  by a heterozygous deletion of peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene resulting in focal sensorimotor deficits. Our lab has identified a disruption of myelin junctions in excessively permeable myelin that impairs action potential propagation. This mechanism is expected to cause fatigue in patients with HNPP. Therefore, the objective was to characterize fatigue in patients with HNPP and determine the relationship of fatigue to nerve pathology, disability, and quality of life. METHODS: Nine females with HNPP participated in a single visit that included genotyping, nerve conduction studies, neurological exam, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, and a physical therapy exam incorporating upper and lower extremity function and survey measures of fatigue. This visit was followed by 2 weeks of ecological momentary assessment (wrist-worn device) that captured fatigue ratings five times per day. RESULTS: Participants demonstrated mild neurological impairment (CMTNS: 5.7 ± 2.8), yet reported high fatigue levels (average fatigue intensity over 2 weeks: 5.9 out of 10). Higher fatigue levels were associated with poorer quality of life and more pain. Higher fatigue was associated with significantly greater distal nerve proton density changes on peripheral nerve MRI, which is in line with hyper-permeable myelin in HNPP. INTERPRETATION: Fatigue is common and severe among patients with HNPP whose disabilities are minimal by conventional outcome measures. Therapeutic interventions targeting fatigue have the potential to improve quality of life and may serve as a robust outcome measure to show longitudinal changes for patients with HNPP.

N2  - The aim of the study was to critically review the clinical approach to distinguish  the sensory and motor nerve fascicles of the peripheral nerve system and to explore potential novel techniques to meet the clinical needs. The principles and shortcomings of the currently used methods for identification of sensory and motor nerve fascicles, including nerve morphology, electrical stimulation, spectroscopy, enzymohistochemistry staining (acetylcholinesterase [AchE], carbonic anhydrase [CA] and choline acetyltransferase [ChAC] histochemistry staining methods), and immunochemical staining were systematically reviewed. The progress in diffusion tensor imaging, proteomic approaches, and quantum dots (QDs) assessment in clinical applications to identify sensory or motor fascicles has been discussed. Traditional methods such as physical and enzymohistochemical methods are not suitable for the precise differentiation of sensory and motor nerve fascicles. Immunohistochemical staining using AchE, CA, and ChAC is promising in differentiation of sensory and motor nerve fascicles. Diffusion tensor imaging can reflect morphological details of nerve fibers. Proteomics can reveal the dynamics of specific proteins discriminating sensory and motor fascicles. QDs, with their size-dependent optical properties, make them the ideal protein markers for identification of the sensory or motor nerves. Diffusion tensor imaging, proteomics and QDs-imaging will facilitate the clinical identification of motor and sensory nerve fascicles, help in improving surgical success rates and assist in postoperative functional recovery.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of Ultra-high field  [UHF] 7 Tesla [T] MRI as compared to 3T MRI in non-contrast enhanced [nCE] imaging of structural anatomy in the elbow, forearm, and hand [upper extremity]. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A wide range of sequences including T1 weighted [T1] volumetric interpolate breath-hold exam [VIBE], T2 weighted [T2] double-echo steady state [DESS], susceptibility weighted imaging [SWI], time-of-flight [TOF], diffusion tensor imaging [DTI], and diffusion spectrum imaging [DSI] were optimized and incorporated with a radiofrequency [RF] coil system composed of a transverse electromagnetic [TEM] transmit coil combined with an 8-channel receive-only array for 7T upper extremity [UE] imaging. In addition, Siemens optimized protocol/sequences were used on a 3T scanner and the resulting images from T1 VIBE and T2 DESS were compared to that obtained at 7T qualitatively and quantitatively [SWI was only qualitatively compared]. DSI studio was utilized to identify nerves based on analysis of diffusion weighted derived fractional anisotropy images. Images of forearm vasculature were extracted using a paint grow manual segmentation method based on MIPAV [Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization]. RESULTS: High resolution and high quality signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]-images of the hand, forearm, and elbow were acquired with nearly homogeneous 7T excitation. Measured [performed on the T1 VIBE and T2 DESS sequences] SNR and CNR values were almost doubled at 7T vs. 3T. Cartilage, synovial fluid and tendon structures could be seen with higher clarity in the 7T T1 and T2 weighted images. SWI allowed high resolution and better quality imaging of large and medium sized arteries and veins, capillary networks and arteriovenous anastomoses at 7T when compared to 3T. 7T diffusion weighted sequence [not performed at 3T] demonstrates that the forearm nerves are clearly delineated by fiber tractography. The proper digital palmar arteries and superficial palmar arch could also be clearly visualized using TOF nCE 7T MRI. CONCLUSION: Ultra-high resolution neurovascular imaging in upper extremities is possible at 7T without use of renal toxic intravenous contrast. 7T MRI can provide superior peripheral nerve [based on fiber anisotropy and diffusion coefficient parameters derived from diffusion tensor/spectrum imaging] and vascular [nCE MRA and vessel segmentation] imaging.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate large coverage magnetic resonance  neurography (MRN) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In this prospective study, 18 patients with CIDP and 18 healthy controls were examined by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 T. Lumbosacral plexus was imaged by a T2-weighted 3D sequence and peripheral nerves of the upper and lower extremity by axial T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences. Lesions were characterized by nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) and T2-weighted signal (nT2). Additionally, T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve was performed using a multi-spin-echo sequence. All patients received a complementary electrophysiological exam. Patients with CIDP exhibited increased nerve CSA and nT2 compared to controls (p < 0.05) in a proximally predominating pattern. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed the best diagnostic accuracy for CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (AUC = 0.88) and nT2 of the sciatic nerve (AUC = 0.88). CSA correlated with multiple electrophysiological parameters of demyelinating neuropathy (F wave latency, nerve conduction velocity) of sciatic and median nerve, while nT2 only correlated with F wave latency of sciatic and not median nerve. T2 relaxometry indicated that MR signal increase in CIDP was due to an increase in proton-spin-density (p < 0.05), and not due to the increase in T2 relaxation time. Both nT2 and CSA might aid in the diagnosis of CIDP, but CSA correlates more robustly with established electrophysiological parameters for CIDP. Since the best diagnostic accuracy was shown for proximal nerve locations, MRN may be a useful complementary tool in selected CIDP cases.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic potential of diffusion  tensor imaging (DTI) for pathologies of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) through clinical, electrophysiological and morphological evaluation of the median nerve. METHODS: The present work was a multilevel prospective study involving 30 subjects, 15 of whom had carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and 15 healthy controls. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation through administration of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), electroneurography (ENG), 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging with DTI, and calculation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at the flexor retinaculum. Tractography was also performed for three-dimensional reconstruction of the route of the median nerve through the carpal tunnel. The degree of functional impairment was compared with the anatomical damage to the median nerve according to ENG and DTI. RESULTS: FA and ADC were significantly correlated with ENG parameters of CTS and BCTQ data. Mean FA and ADC values in the CTS patients were 0.359±0.06 and 1.866±0.050×10(-3)mm(2)/s, respectively, vs 0.59±0.014 and 1.395±0.035×10(-3)mm(2)/s, respectively, in the controls. FA was decreased and ADC increased in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: DTI parameters were clearly confirmed by both clinical and ENG data and, therefore, may be used for the diagnosis of CTS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Morphology and histology of filum terminale (FT) has a role in the  pathophysiology of tethered cord syndrome (TCS). This research was implemented to investigate the morphometric parameters and histological structure of normal FT in adult human cadavers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to correlate them with the pathophysiology of TCS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty five adult human cadavers (15 males, 10 females) and 100 MRI echo scans of lumbosacral region (50 males and 50 females), were used in this study. MRI patients were divided into 21-40 and 41-60 age groups. The cadavers were dissected at the prone position to explore their fila. The length of FT, filum terminale internum (FTI), filum terminale externum (FTE), vertebral level of beginning, dural piercing and termination of FT, and the initial, midpoint, and mid-FTE diameters were determined. Four segments were excised from lower conus, upper, middle, and lower thirds of FT. The specimens were processed for light microscopic examination. Statistical analysis was done for these parameters. RESULTS: MRI morphometrical parameters of FT, except FTI length, revealed no age effect or sex differences, where length of FTI, FTE, initial diameter, level of conus medullaris termination (CMT) and dural sac termination (DST) were 174.1 ± 16.8, 75.8 ± 9.5, 1.6 ± 0.21, L1-2 and S2U in males and 166.9 ± 18.9, 74.1 ± 9.3, 1.53 ± 0.25, L1-2 and S2M vertebrae in females, respectively. However, non-significant sex difference was observed in morphometric parameters of cadaveric FT, where length of FTI and FTE, initial diameter, CMT and DST levels were 164.2 ± 11.6, 76.7 ± 8.1, 1.7 ± 0.14, L1L and S2U vertebrae in males and 159.2 ± 10.1, 71.02 ± 7.3, 1.6 ± 0.29, L1L and S2U in females, respectively. Moreover, CMT below L2 vertebra was seen in 5% of MRI scans and 8% of cadavers. Also, the initial diameter of FT > 2 mm was recorded in 7% of MRI and 8% of cadaveric cases. Histologically, the structure of FT showed gradual reduction in nervous, glial, and vascular tissues with converse increase in collagen content in FTE compared with those of FTI. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the morphometric parameters and the histological structure of FT are necessary for clinicians who dealing with diagnosis or treatment of tethered cord syndrome.

N2  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is useful to evaluate lumbar nerves visually  and quantitatively. Multi-band sensitivity encoding (MB-SENSE) is a technique to reduce the scan time. This study aimed to investigate if super-multi-gradient DTI with multi-band sensitivity encoding (MB-SENSE) is better in evaluating lumbar nerves than the conventional method. METHODS: The participants were 12 healthy volunteers (mean age 33.6 years). In all subjects, DTI was performed using echo planar imaging with different motion probing gradient (MPG) directions (15 without MB, and 15, 32, 64, and 128 with MB) and the lumbar nerve roots were visualized with tractography. In the five groups, we evaluated the resultant DTI both visually and quantitatively. For visual measures, we counted the number of fluffs and disruptions of the nerve fibers. For quantitative measures, the fractional anisotropy (FA) and standard deviation of the fractional anisotropy (FA-SD) values at two regions (proximal and distal) of the lumbar nerve roots were quantified and compared. RESULTS: Among the five groups, the number of fluffs decreased as the number of MPG directions increased. However, the number of disruptions showed no significant differences. The FA-SD values decreased as the number of MPG directions increased, indicating that the signal variation was reduced with multi-gradient directional DTI. CONCLUSION: High-resolution multi-directional DTI with MB-SENSE may be useful to visualize nerve entrapments and may allow for more accurate DTI parameter quantification with opportunities for clinical diagnostic applications.

N2  - There is no imaging modality to quantitatively evaluate compressed cervical nerve  roots in cervical radiculopathy. Here we sought to evaluate the usefulness of simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with nerve-sheath signal increased with inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of relaxation-enhancement imaging (SHINKEI-Quant) to evaluate compressed nerves quantitatively in patients with cervical radiculopathy due to cervical disc hernia before microendoscopic surgery. One patient with cervical radiculopathy due to cervical disc hernia before microendoscopic surgery and 5 healthy subjects underwent simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with SHINKEI-Quant. The patient was a 49-year-old man with severe right upper arm pain and numbness. Based on MRI images, we suspected right C7 radiculopathy due to C6-7 cervical disc hernia. The T2 relaxation times of the cervical dorsal root ganglia of the brachial plexus bilaterally at C5-C8 were measured. We observed no significant differences in T2 relaxation times between the nerve roots on the left and right at each spinal level with values in healthy subjects. In our patient, neurography revealed swelling of the right C7 nerve, and a prolonged T2 relaxation time compared with that of the contralateral, unaffected C7 nerve. We performed microendoscopic surgery and the symptoms improved. We were able to evaluate the injured nerve root quantitatively in a patient with cervical radiculopathy using the SHINKEI-Quant technique, being the first study to our knowledge to show the usefulness of this technique to evaluate cervical radiculopathy quantitatively before microendoscopic surgery.

N2  - The popularization and application of microscopy, the in-depth study of the  microanatomy of the cerebellopontine angle, and the application of intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring technology to preserve facial nerve function have laid a solid foundation for the modern era of neurosurgery. The preoperative prediction of the location of the facial nerve is a long-desired goal of neurosurgeons. The advances in neuroimaging seem to be making this goal a reality. Many studies investigating the reliability of the preoperative prediction of the location of the facial nerve using diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking in vestibular schwannoma have been reported in the last 20 years. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for articles published before March 30, 2020. A comprehensive review of published studies was carried out in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the reported data to assess the reliability of the preoperative prediction of the location of the facial nerve using diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking in vestibular schwannoma. The data were analyzed using a fixed-effects model. The estimated overall intraoperative verification concordance rate was 89.05% (95% confidence interval 85.06%-92.58%). Preoperatively predicting the location of the facial nerve using diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking in vestibular schwannoma is reliable, but the extent to which it contributes to long-term facial nerve function is still unclear. To further verify these results, studies with larger sample sizes are needed in the future, especially prospective randomized controlled trials focusing on the long-term functional preservation of the facial nerve.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Peripapillary hyper-reflective ovoid masslike structures (PHOMS) are a  new spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) finding. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal study included patients (n = 212) with multiple sclerosis (MS; n = 418 eyes), 59 healthy controls (HCs; n = 117 eyes), and 267 non-MS disease controls (534 eyes). OCT and diffusion tensor imaging were used. RESULTS: There were no PHOMS in HC eyes (0/117, 0%). The prevalence of PHOMS was significantly higher in patients with MS (34/212, p = 0.001) and MS eyes (45/418, p = 0.0002) when compared to HCs (0/59, 0/117). The inter-rater agreement for PHOMS was 97.9% (kappa = 0.951). PHOMS were present in 16% of patients with relapsing-remitting, 16% of patients with progressive, and 12% of patients with secondary progressive disease course (2% of eyes). There was no relationship of PHOMS with age, disease duration, disease course, disability, or disease-modifying treatments. The fractional anisotropy of the optic radiations was lower in patients without PHOMS (0.814) when compared to patients with PHOMS (0.845, p = 0.03). The majority of PHOMS remained stable, but increase in size and de novo development of PHOMS were also observed. In non-MS disease controls, PHOMS were observed in intracranial hypertension (62%), optic disc drusen (47%), anomalous optic discs (44%), isolated optic neuritis (19%), and optic atrophy (12%). INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that PHOMS are a novel finding in MS pathology. Future research is needed to determine whether development of PHOMS in MS is due to intermittently raised intracranial pressure or an otherwise impaired "glymphatic" outflow from eye to brain.

N2  - Background  Brachial plexus (BP) is composed of intercommunications among the  ventral roots of the nerves C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 in the neck. The in vivo and in vitro evaluation of axons of the peripheral nervous system is performed using different techniques. Recently, many studies describing the application of fiber tractography and stereological axon number estimation to peripheral nerves have been published. Methods  Various quantitative parameters of nerve fibers, including axon number, density, axonal area, and myelin thickness, can be estimated using stereological techniques. In vivo three-dimensional reconstruction of axons of BP can be visualized using a combined technique of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tracking with the potential to evaluate nerve fiber content. Conclusion  It is concluded that terminal branches of BP can be successfully visualized using DTI, which is a highly reproducible method for the evaluation of BP as it shows anatomical and functional features of neural structures. We believe that quantitative morphological findings obtained from BP will be useful for new experimental, developmental, and pathological studies in the future.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the longitudinal relationship between chemotherapy-induced  peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms (sx) and brain perfusion changes in patients with breast cancer. Interaction of CIPN-sx perfusion effects with known chemotherapy-associated gray matter density decrease was also assessed to elucidate the relationship between CIPN and previously reported cancer treatment-related brain structural changes. METHODS: Patients with breast cancer treated with (n = 24) or without (n = 23) chemotherapy underwent clinical examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging at the following three time points: before treatment (baseline), 1 month after treatment completion, and 1 year after the 1-month assessment. CIPN-sx were evaluated with the self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity four-item sensory-specific scale. Perfusion and gray matter density were assessed using voxel-based pulsed arterial spin labeling and morphometric analyses and tested for association with CIPN-sx in the patients who received chemotherapy. RESULTS: Patients who received chemotherapy reported significantly increased CIPN-sx from baseline to 1 month, with partial recovery by 1 year (P < .001). CIPN-sx increase from baseline to 1 month was significantly greater for patients who received chemotherapy compared with those who did not (P = .001). At 1 month, neuroimaging showed that for the group that received chemotherapy, CIPN-sx were positively associated with cerebral perfusion in the right superior frontal gyrus and cingulate gyrus, regions associated with pain processing (P < .001). Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging analysis in the group receiving chemotherapy indicated that CIPN-sx and associated perfusion changes from baseline to 1 month were also positively correlated with gray matter density change (P < .005). CONCLUSION: Peripheral neuropathy symptoms after systemic chemotherapy for breast cancer are associated with changes in cerebral perfusion and gray matter. The specific mechanisms warrant further investigation given the potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

N2  - A novel magnetic resonance imaging approach, called diffusion-direction-dependent  imaging (DDI), is introduced. Due to inherent anisotropic diffusion properties, peripheral nerves can be visualized on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The largest signal attenuation on DTI correlates with the direction of a nerve fiber, and the least signal attenuation correlates with the direction perpendicular to the nerve fiber. Since low signal-to-noise ratio is a concern in peripheral nerve DTI, we explored a new approach focusing on the perpendicular diffusion direction. A 36-gradient diffusion direction scheme was used. A mean expected curve specific for peripheral nerves was calculated based on the sciatic nerve and its division into the common peroneal nerve and the tibial nerve in three healthy volunteers. By a simple postprocessing method, a comparison of the mean expected curve and the measured curve was made voxel by voxel, and the sciatic nerve and its division were reconstructed, excluding other tissues. More studies are needed to investigate whether other postprocessing methods or other diffusion direction schemes are more suited for peripheral nerve imaging with DDI. Further studies may also be of interest to investigate whether DDI can be a complementary method to conventional T(1)-weighted and T(2)-weighted sequences in the imaging of peripheral nerve pathology or even in the visualization of other tissues, possibly with different diffusion direction schemes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Differentiating multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) from amyotrophic  lateral sclerosis (ALS) is important, as MMN is a difficult, but treatable disorder. METHODS: We studied peripheral nerve imaging techniques in differentiating MMN from ALS by measuring the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median and ulnar nerves in the forearms using high resolution ultrasound (HRUS) and MRI. RESULTS: HRUS CSA values of the median nerve in the forearm (P = 0.002) and the ulnar nerve distal to the sulcus (P = 0.009) were significantly enlarged in patients with MMN. There was a positive correlation between CSA as measured with HRUS and MRI (Spearman rho 0.60; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral nerve imaging is a potentially powerful technique to distinguish MMN from ALS. Muscle Nerve, 2016 Muscle Nerve 54: 1133-1135, 2016.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical feasibility of  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the evaluation of peripheral nerves in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). METHODS: Using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, we obtained DTI scans of the tibial nerves of 10 CIDP patients and 10 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. We prepared fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, measured the FA values of tibial nerves, and compared these values in the two study groups. In nine patients, we also performed tibial nerve conduction studies and analyzed the correlation between the FA values and parameters of the nerve conduction study. RESULTS: The tibial nerve FA values in CIDP patients (median 0.401, range 0.312-0.510) were significantly lower than those in healthy volunteers (median 0.530, range 0.469-0.647) (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.01). They were significantly correlated with the amplitude of action potential (Spearman correlation coefficient, p = 0.04, r = 0.86) but not with nerve conduction velocity (p = 0.79, r = 0.11). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest that the noninvasive DTI assessment of peripheral nerves may provide useful information in patients with CIDP.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic determinants of peripheral nerve diffusion tensor  imaging (DTI) and to establish normal values for fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD). METHODS: Sixty subjects were examined at 3 Tesla by single-shot DTI. FA, AD, RD, and MD were collected for the sciatic, tibial, median, ulnar, and radial nerve and were correlated with demographic variables. RESULTS: Mean FA of all nerves declined with increasing age (r = -0.77), which could be explained by RD increasing (r = 0.56) and AD declining (r = -0.40) with age. Moreover, FA was inversely associated with height (r = -0.28), weight (r = -0.38) and BMI (r = -0.35). Although FA tended to be lower in men than women (p = 0.052), this difference became completely negligible after adjustment to body weight. A multiple linear regression model for FA was calculated with age and weight as predictors (defined by backward variable selection), yielding an R (2) = 0.71 and providing a correction formula to adjust FA for age and weight. CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve DTI parameters depend on demographic variables. The most important determinants age and weight should be considered in all studies employing peripheral nerve DTI. KEY POINTS: • Peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters depend on demographic variables. • Fractional anisotropy (FA) declines with increasing age and weight. • Gender does not systematically affect peripheral nerve DTI. • The formula presented here allows adjustment of FA for demographic variables.

N2  - 7.0 Tesla (T) high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can supply information  on changing microstructures in cranial nerves. We investigated DTI parameters and the feasibility of DTI criteria for diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia (TN). In this study, 14 patients (28 hemispheres) of mean age 49.0 years (range, 31-64) with TN underwent DTI using 7.0 TMRI. We compared fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) of affected-side and unaffected-side trigeminal nerves using DTI. We examined associations between DTI parameters and clinical characteristics for patients with TN. In patients with TN, affected sides showed significantly decreased FA and significantly increased MD, and RD compared with unaffected sides of trigeminal nerves. Nuclei were not significantly different among patients with TN. Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain scores did not correlate with affected sides. 7.0 T DTI was useful for detecting neurovascular compression in patients with TN. The increased signal-to-noise ratio provided by 7 T MRI should be advantageous for increasing spatial resolution to detect microstructure changes to trigeminal nerves in patients with TN.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To use pre- and post-operative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to monitor  median nerve integrity in patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: Diffusivity and anisotropy images along the median nerve were compared among 12 patients, 12 age-matched and 12 young control subjects and correlated with electrophysiological neurography results. Slice-wise DTI parameter values were calculated to focus on local changes. RESULTS: Results of pre-operative patients and age-matched control subjects differed only in the distal nerve. Moreover, pre-operative patients differed significantly from young controls and post-operative patients. The main abnormalities were increased diffusivity and decreased anisotropy in the carpal tunnel and distal median nerve. Post-operative clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but not in anisotropy. Slice-wise analysis showed high pre-operative diffusivity at the distal nerve. All groups had relatively large inter-subject variation in both diffusivity and anisotropy. CONCLUSIONS: DTI can provide information complementary to clinical examination, electrophysiological recordings and anatomical MRI of diseases and injuries of peripheral nerves. However, similar age-related changes in diffusivity and anisotropy may weaken DTI specificity. Slice-wise analysis is necessary for detection of local changes in nerve integrity. KEY POINTS: • Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging provides information complementary to conventional diagnostic methods. • Age caused similar changes to diffusivity and anisotropy as carpal tunnel syndrome. • Post-operative clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but not in anisotropy. • Inter-subject variation in diffusivity and anisotropy was considerable.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate in vivo morphological and functional correlates of  oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXA-PNP) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). METHODS: Twenty patients (7 female, 13 male, 58.9±10.0 years) with mild to moderate OXA-PNP and 20 matched controls (8 female, 12 male, 55.7±15.6 years) were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent a detailed neurophysiological examination prior to neuroimaging. A standardized imaging protocol at 3.0 Tesla included the lumbosacral plexus and both sciatic nerves and their branches using T2-weighted fat-saturated sequences and diffusion tensor imaging. Quantitative assessment included volumetry of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), sciatic nerve normalized T2 (nT2) signal and caliber, and fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). Additional qualitative evaluation of sciatic, peroneal, and tibial nerves evaluated the presence, degree, and distribution of nerve lesions. RESULTS: DRG hypertrophy in OXA-PNP patients (207.3±47.7mm3 vs. 153.0±47.1mm3 in controls, p = 0.001) was found as significant morphological correlate of the sensory neuronopathy. In contrast, peripheral nerves only exhibited minor morphological alterations qualitatively. Quantitatively, sciatic nerve caliber (27.3±6.7mm2 vs. 27.4±7.4mm2, p = 0.80) and nT2 signal were not significantly changed in patients (1.32±0.22 vs. 1.22±0.26, p = 0.16). AD, RD, and MD showed a non-significant decrease in patients, while FA was unchanged. CONCLUSION: OXA-PNP manifests with morphological and functional correlates that can be detected in vivo by MRN. We report hypertrophy of the DRG that stands in contrast to experimental and postmortem studies. DRG volume should be further investigated as a biomarker in other sensory peripheral neuropathies and ganglionopathies.

N2  - BACKGROUND After successful utilization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in  detecting brain pathologies, it is now being examined for use in the detection of peripheral neuropathies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic potentials of DTI in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). MATERIAL AND METHODS The literature search was performed in multiple electronic databases using a keyword search and final selection of the studies was based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We performed a meta-analyses of mean differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between CTS patient and healthy subjects. Publication bias detection was done with Begg's test and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the source/s of higher heterogeneity and the authenticity of results. RESULTS FA was significantly lower in CTS patients in comparison with healthy subjects (mean and the difference [95% confidence interval] was -0.06 [-0.10, -0.02] (p=0.003). The ADC was significantly higher in CTS patients (mean difference [95% CI] was 0.10 [0.02, 0.18], p=0.02). Overall sensitivity of FA-based diagnosis was 82.82%, with 77.83% specificity. CONCLUSIONS DTI can be a valuable tool in diagnosing CTS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of pain in Parkinson's disease (PD) is still poorly  understood, although it is conceivable that supraspinal mechanisms may be responsible for pain generation and maintenance. METHODS: We examined brain functional and anatomical changes associated with persistent pain in 40 PD patients, 20 with persistent pain and 20 without pain. We also examined 15 pain-free healthy participants of similar age, gender, and cognitive state as a control group. We assessed pain by the King's Parkinson's Pain Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale for pain, and the Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Symptoms and Sign. All patients underwent structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting-state functional MRI. We compared clinical characteristics, whole-brain cortical thickness, subcortical volumes, diffusion tensor imaging scalar measures, and functional connectivity by network based statistics. RESULTS: The group with PD and persistent pain showed significant thinning in the bilateral temporal pole, left-medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral superior and left-inferior parietal areas, pars orbicularis, and right superior frontal, posterior cingulated, and precentral cortex. There were no significant subcortical volume and white matter differences between PD subgroups. Functional MRI showed a decrease of brain activity in the left frontal inferior orbital in PD patients with persistent pain, with greater activity bilaterally in the cerebellum and in the right inferior temporal areas. Only PD patients with persistent pain showed an accumbens-hippocampus disconnection without white matter and subcortical alterations. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that persistent pain in PD is associated with supraspinal structural and functional changes. We also highlighted the contribution of frontal, prefrontal, and insular areas in nociceptive modulation and accumbens-hippocampus disconnection. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

N2  - The underlying factors contributing to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity, a known  precursor to skin breakdown in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM), is likely to involve multiple body systems. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify multi-system factors associated with metatarsophalangeal joint deformity in individuals with type 2 DM and peripheral neuropathy (n = 60). Metatarsophalangeal joint deformity was quantified with a computed tomography (CT) scan. System biomarkers included the musculoskeletal system (foot intrinsic muscle deterioration, tarsal/metatarsal bone mineral density, ankle dorsiflexion, metatarsophalangeal extension movement during a sit to stand task); the vascular system (ankle-brachial index); and the endocrine/immune systems (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, skin intrinsic fluorescence, and hemoglobin A1C). Muscle deterioration (r = 0.27), bone density (r = -0.35), metatarsophalangeal extension movement (r = 0.50), maximum dorsiflexion (r = -0.31), and ankle-brachial index (r = 0.33) were related to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity (p < 0.05). Bone mineral density and metatarsophalangeal extension movement were retained in a regression model relating to deformity (R(2) = 0.34). All musculoskeletal system biomarkers and the ankle-brachial index demonstrated weak to moderate relationships to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity. Bone mineral density of the tarsal/metatarsal bones and extending the toes during a sit to stand task were the two strongest factors associated with metatarsophalangeal joint deformity. Evaluation and management of foot bone mineral density and toe extension movement pattern could reduce metatarsophalangeal joint deformity and the risk of skin breakdown and subsequent amputation.

N2  - We examined if MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking could be performed on  the sciatic nerve. In 3 healthy volunteers the proximal thigh was examined on a 1.5-Tesla MR-scanner with a 2-channel phased-array coil. Though inherently susceptible to motion, field inhomogeneities, and fast T(2)-relaxation of the diffusion imaging technique, the sciatic nerve could be detected and correlated to T(2)-weighted images in all 3 subjects. Further investigations need to be done to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to see if smaller peripheral nerves than the sciatic nerve can be detected.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to assess diffusion tensor imaging in the diagnosis of  mild-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and to correlate fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with nerve conduction study and clinical tests. This prospective study was conducted upon 39 patients (9 males, 30 females; mean age = 33 years) with early stage of CTS. Twenty age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were included as a control group. All patients underwent clinical tests and nerve conduction studies with calculation of the distal motor latency (DML) and distal sensory latency (DSL). Patients with CTS and volunteers underwent diffusion tensor imaging of the median nerve. The cross-sectional area (CSA), FA, and ADC of the median nerve were calculated. There was significant difference in FA and ADC between patients and controls (P = 0.001 respectively) and between mild and moderate CTS (P = 0.001 respectively). The cutoff FA and ADC of the median nerve used for the diagnosis of CTS were 0.45 and 1.31 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.985 and 0.954, respectively, and the values used to differentiate mild from moderate CTS were 0.42 and 1.35 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s with AUC of 0.964 and 0.688, respectively. The FA and ADC of the median nerve were correlated with CSA (r = 0.894; -0.769), DML (r = -0.935; 0.781), DSL (r = -0.953; 0.781), Tinel's test (r = 0.742; 0.684), and Phalen's test (r = 0.862; 0.742). Diffusion tensor imaging can be used for the diagnosis of mild-moderate CTS and well correlated with nerve conduction studies and clinical tests.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sacral nerve root features by the means of magnetic  resonance imaging-diffusion tensor imaging (MRI-DTI) tractography in women with endometriosis and/or adenomyosis, and to analyze the correlations among DTI abnormalities, pain symptoms, and endometriotic lesions found at surgery. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, observational study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Women (n = 76) with clinical suspicion of endometriosis. INTERVENTIONS: Before surgery, dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, and noncyclic pelvic pain (NCPP) were assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale. MRI enabled a 3-dimensional reconstruction of S1, S2, and S3. Fractional anisotropy was calculated for each root. Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis was performed in 56 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our findings revealed correlations among sacral root reconstruction by MRI-DTI, pain symptoms, and laparoscopic findings. DTI of sacral roots revealed a regular and homogeneous appearance in 17 patients (25.8%) and abnormalities in microstructure reconstruction, with fiber irregularities and disorganization and loss of the simple unidirectional course, in 44 patients (66.7%). At laparoscopy, ovarian endometriomas were found in 82.1% of the patients, and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) were found in 57.1%. Endometriosis was staged according to the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification. Pathological DTI findings were significantly associated with the severity of dysmenorrhea and NCPP, pain duration, presence of tubo-ovarian and cul-de-sac adhesions, and DIE. CONCLUSION: The presence of pathological DTI findings of the sacral nerve roots correlates with the type of pain, adhesions, and DIE. At present, DTI can be useful for providing a better understanding of pain; however, DTI could become a useful tool in therapeutic planning for patients with endometriosis.

N2  - Background Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of peripheral nerves may provide  additional information about nerve involvement in muscular disorders, but is considered difficult due to different optimal scan parameters tailored to magnetic resonance (MR) signal properties of muscle and neural tissues. Purpose To assess the feasibility of sciatic nerve DTI using two different approaches of region of interest (ROI)-localization in DTI scans with b-values 500 s/mm(2), in participants with muscular disorders and in controls. Material and Methods DTI of the thigh was conducted on a 3T system in ten patients (6 men, 4 women; mean age =54 ± 15 years) with neuromuscular disorders and ten controls. T1-weighted (T1W) images were co-registered to fractional anisotropy (FA) color-encoded images. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, and fiber track length (FTL) were analyzed by two operators using a freehand ROI and a single-point ROI covering the sciatic nerve. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis were used for evaluation of inter-operator and inter-technical agreement, respectively. Results Three-dimensional visualization of sciatic nerve fiber was achievable using both techniques. The ICC of DTI metrics showed excellent inter-operator agreement both in patients and controls. Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement of both techniques. A maximum FTL was achieved using the single-point ROI technique, but with a lower inter-operator agreement (ICC = 0.99 vs. 0.83). The ADC and maximum FTL were significantly decreased in patients compared to controls. Conclusion Both ROI localization techniques are feasible to analyze the sciatic nerve in the setting of muscular disease. A maximum FTL is reached using the single-point ROI, however, at the cost of lower inter-operator agreement.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To delineate fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion  coefficient (ADC) values of compressed nerve roots in patients with lumbar disc herniation by diffusion tensor imaging and fiber bundle tracing and investigate the relationship between FA and ADC values and Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and visual analog scale scores. METHODS: Twenty patients with lumbar disc herniation and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were assessed using the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire and visual analog scale. All subjects underwent conventional sagittal T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, axial T2-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tractography. RESULTS: In 20 patients with lumbar disc herniation, there were 31 nerve roots involved (9/31 L4, 15/31 L5, and 7/31 S1). Mean Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire scores of patients were 53.55% ± 11.91%, and mean visual analog scale scores were 5.96 ± 1.64. FA values of lumbar nerve roots were 0.332 ± 0.014 in healthy volunteers. FA values of compressed lumbar nerve roots were 0.251 ± 0.022, significantly lower than FA values of contralateral noncompressed nerve roots and lumbar nerve roots of healthy volunteers. ADC values of lumbar nerve roots were 1.763 ± 0.075 in healthy volunteers. ADC values of compressed lumbar nerve roots were 2.090 ± 0.078, significantly higher than ADC values of contralateral noncompressed nerve roots and lumbar nerve roots of healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: Fiber tractography is capable of delineating microstructural changes of lumbosacral nerve roots, and radiculopathy in lumbar disc herniation is associated with significant changes in FA and ADC values.

N2  - PURPOSE: Imaging criteria for diagnosing compressive ulnar neuropathy at the elbow  (UNE) have recently been established as the maximum ulnar nerve cross-sectional area (UNCSA) upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or ultrasonography (US). However, the levels of maximum UNCSA and diagnostic cutoff values have not yet been established. We therefore analyzed UNCSA by MRI and US in patients with UNE and in controls. METHODS: We measured UNCSA at 7 levels in 30 patients with UNE and 28 controls by MRI and at 15 levels in 12 patients with UNE and 24 controls by US. We compared UNCSA as determined by MRI or US and determined optimal diagnostic cutoff values based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: The UNCSA was significantly larger in the UNE group than in controls at 3, 2, 1, and 0 cm proximal and 1, 2, and 3 cm distal to the medial epicondyle for both modalities. The UNCSA was maximal at 1 cm proximal to the medial epicondyle for MRI (16.1 ± 3.5 mm(2)) as well as for US (17 ± 7 mm(2)). A cutoff value of 11.0 mm(2) for MRI and US was found to be optimal for differentiating between patients with UNE and controls, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 for MRI and 0.96 for US. The UNCSA measured by MRI was not significantly different from that by US. Intra-rater and interrater reliabilities for UNCSA were all greater than 0.77. The UNCSA in the severe nerve dysfunction group of 18 patients was significantly larger than that in the mild nerve dysfunction group of 12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: By measuring UNCSA with MRI or US at 1 cm proximal to the ME, patients with and without UNE could be discriminated at a cutoff threshold of 11.0 mm(2) with high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic III.

N2  - Magnetic resonance techniques have become increasingly important in neurology for  defining: 1. brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerve or muscle structure; 2. pathological changes in tissue structures and properties; and 3. dynamic patterns of functional activation of the brain. New applications have been driven in part by advances in hardware, particularly improvements in magnet and gradient coil design. New imaging strategies allow novel approaches to contrast with, for example, diffusion imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, perfusion imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging. In parallel with developments in hardware and image acquisition have been new approaches to image analysis. These have allowed quantitative descriptions of the image changes to be used for a precise, non-invasive definition of pathology. With the increasing capabilities and specificity of magnetic resonance techniques it is becoming more important that the neurologist is intimately involved in both the selection of magnetic resonance studies for patients and their interpretation. There is a need for considerably improved access to magnetic resonance technology, particularly in the acute or intensive care ward and in the neurosurgical theatre. This report illustrates several key developments. The task force concludes that magnetic resonance imaging is a major clinical tool of growing significance and offers recommendations for maximizing the potential future for magnetic resonance techniques in neurology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Precise imaging of nerves have been challenging in the head and neck  region, mainly due to low spatial resolution. Here, we investigated how nerves in the head and neck region could be visualized using an ultra-high magnetic field MR system. METHODS: We used formol-carbol-fixed human cadaveric necks and obtained MR diffusion tensor images (DTIs) using a 9.4 Tesla (T) ultra-high magnetic field MR system. Afterward, we prepared tissue sections and checked the anatomic relationships between the neurons and the carotid artery in order to confirm that the visualized fibers are indeed neuron fibers. RESULTS: We were able to identify nerves, including the vagus nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, and the spinal-accessory nerve. Hematoxylin-eosin stained histological sections confirmed neuron fibers in the same anatomic position. CONCLUSION: This technique has the feasibility to be applied for a more accurate anatomic understanding, maybe even close to a histological level.

N2  - This study evaluates whether diffusion tensor imaging magnetic resonance neurography  (DTI-MRN), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density can detect and grade neuropathic abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 49) were included-11 with severe polyneuropathy (sDPN), 13 with mild polyneuropathy (mDPN), and 25 without polyneuropathy (nDPN)-along with 30 healthy control subjects (HCs). Clinical examinations, nerve conduction studies, and vibratory perception thresholds determined the presence and severity of DPN. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal (tibial nerve) nerve segments of the lower extremity. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated, as were T2 relaxation time and proton spin density obtained from DTI-MRN. All magnetic resonance findings were related to the presence and severity of neuropathy. FA of the sciatic and tibial nerves was lowest in the sDPN group. Corresponding with this, proximal and distal ADCs were highest in patients with sDPN compared with patients with mDPN and nDPN, as well as the HCs. DTI-MRN correlated closely with the severity of neuropathy, demonstrating strong associations with sciatic and tibial nerve findings. Quantitative group differences in proton spin density were also significant, but less pronounced than those for DTI-MRN. In conclusion, DTI-MRN enables detection in peripheral nerves of abnormalities related to DPN, more so than proton spin density or T2 relaxation time. These abnormalities are likely to reflect pathology in sciatic and tibial nerve fibers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to clarify the normal fractional anisotropy (FA) and  apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the sciatic and femoral nerves at the level of the hip joint and to visualize the neural tracts with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 men and 12 women, age 20-29 years) underwent DTI for visualization with tractography and quantification of FA and ADC values on a 3 Tesla MRI (b value = 800 s/mm(2), motion probing gradient, 11 directions, time to repeat/echo time = 9000/72.6 ms, axial slice orientation, slice thickness = 3.0 mm with no inter-slice gap, field of view = 320 × 320 mm, 96 × 192 matrix, 75 slices, number of acquisitions = 4). Regions of interest in the sciatic nerve were defined at the femoral head, the S1 root, and the midpoint levels. The femoral nerve was evaluated at 3-4 cm proximal to the femoral head level. RESULTS: The tractography of the sciatic and femoral nerves were visualized in all participants. The mean FA values of the sciatic nerve were increased distally from the S1 root level, through the midpoint, and to the femoral head level (0.314, 0.446, 0.567, p = 0.001, respectively). The mean FA values of the femoral nerve were 0.565. The mean ADC values of the sciatic nerves were significantly lower in the S1 root level than in the midpoint and the femoral head level (1.481, 1.602, 1.591 × 10(-3) × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, p = 0.001, respectively). The ADC values of the femoral nerve were 1.439 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s. FA and ADC values showed moderate to substantial inter- and intra-observer reliability without significant differences in gender or laterality. CONCLUSION: Visualization and quantification of the sciatic and femoral nerves simultaneously around the hip joint were achieved in healthy young volunteers with DTI. Clinical application of DTI is expected to contribute to hip pain research.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in  quantitatively monitoring chronic constriction injuri (CCI) of sciatic nerves and to analyse the association of DTI parameters with nerve histology and limb function. METHODS: CCI was created on sciatic nerves in the right hind legs of 20 rabbits with the left as control. DTI parameters-fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD)-and limb function were longitudinally evaluated. Pathology analysis was performed on day 3 (d3), week 1 (w1), 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. RESULTS: FA of the constricted nerves decreased on d3 (0.316 ± 0.044) and increased from w1 to w10 (0.331 ± 0.018, 0.354 ± 0.044, 0.375 ± 0.015, 0.394 ± 0.020, 0.42 ± 0.03 and 0.464 ± 0.039). ADC increased on d3 until w2 (1.502 ± 0.126, 1.462 ± 0.058 and 1.473 ± 0.124 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1)) and decreased to normal from w4 to w10 (1.356 ± 0.129, 1.375 ± 0.107, 1.290 ± 0.064 and 1.298 ± 0.026 × 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1)). AD decreased and stayed low from d3 to w10 (2.042 ± 0.160, 2.005 ± 0.095, 2.057 ± 0.124, 1.952 ± 0.213, 1.988 ± 0.180, 1.947 ± 0.106 and 2.097 ± 0.114). RD increased on d3 (1.233 ± 0.152) and declined from w1 to w10 (1.19 ± 0.06, 1.181 ± 0.14, 1.071 ± 0.102, 1.068 ± 0.084, 0.961 ± 0.063 and 0.923 ± 0.058). FA, ADC and RD correlated significantly with limb functional scores (all Ps < 0.0001) and their changes were associated with histological changes. CONCLUSION: FA, ADC and RD are promising to monitor CCI. AD may be a stable indicator for injury. Histological changes, oedema, axon loss and demyelination, and fibrosis, accompanied the changes of these parameters. Advances in knowledge: DTI parameters can detect and monitor acute and chronic changes after nerve compression.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze peripheral nerves with ultrasonography (US) and magnetic  resonance imaging (MR) in leprosy and assess the role of imaging in leprosy patients. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Fifty-eight nerves with abnormal clinical features or electromyograms were examined in 23 leprosy patients by means of gray-scale US, Doppler US and MR imaging. Image analysis included: measurement of nerve cross-sectional area; assessment of nerve structure and MR signal intensities; identification of nerve compression within osteofibrous tunnels; detection of endoneural color flow signals and Gd-DTPA enhancement. Correlations were made with clinical findings and a control group of 20 subjects. Fourteen nerves in active reversal reaction were followed up after therapy. RESULTS: Leprosy nerves were classified into three groups based on imaging appearance: group I consisted of 17 normal-appearing nerves; group II, of 30 enlarged nerves with fascicular abnormalities; group III, of 11 nerves with absent fascicular structure. Group II nerves were from patients subjected to reversal reactions; 75% of patients with group III nerves had a history of erythema nodosum leprosum. Nerve compression in osteofibrous tunnels was identified in 33% of group II and 18% of group III nerves. Doppler US and MR imaging were 74% and 92% sensitive in identifying active reactions, based on detection of endoneural color flow signals, long T2 and Gd enhancement. In 64% of cases, follow-up studies showed decreased color flow and Gd uptake after steroids and decompressive surgery. CONCLUSIONS: US and MR imaging are able to detect nerves abnormalities in leprosy. Active reversal reactions are indicated by endoneural color flow signals as well as by an increased T2 signal and Gd enhancement. These signs would suggest rapid progression of nerve damage and a poor prognosis unless antireactional treatment is started.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR)  neurography in children, and the potential roles of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fiber-tracking (FT) techniques. METHODS: Five pediatric patients (age range: 6-12 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for various clinical indications: neurogenic bladder (case 1); persistent hand pain following minor trauma (case 2); progressive atrophy of the lower left extremity muscles (case 3); bilateral hip pain (case 4); and palpable left supraclavicular mass (case 5). All studies were performed using a 1.5-T Avanto MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The protocol included 3D T2-weighted STIR and SPACE imaging, T1-weighted fat-saturation post-gadolinium imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tractography. ADC (N×10(-3) mm(2)/s) and FA values were calculated from regions of interest (ROIs) centered on the nerves. Nerve-fiber tracks were calculated using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (NeuroD software). RESULTS: MR neurography allowed satisfactory visualization of all neural structures, and FA and ADC measurements were feasible. The final diagnoses were Tarlov cysts, median-nerve compression, sciatic perineurioma, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and plexiform neurofibroma in a patient with NF-1. DISCUSSION: FA and ADC measurements are of little value because of the lack of normal reference values. Nerve-fiber tractography (FT) may be of value in the characterization of tumor pathology, and is also helpful in the planning of surgical treatments. CONCLUSION: MR neurography is feasible in pediatric patients. However, a considerable amount of work has yet to be done to establish its role in the clinical management of the wide range of peripheral nerve diseases.

N2  - We report here a study of longitudinal relaxation (T1) and magnetisation transfer  (MT) in peripheral nerve. Amphibian sciatic nerve was maintained in vitro and studied at a magnetic field strength of 3 T. A CPMG pulse sequence was modified to include either a saturation pulse to measure T1 relaxation or an off-resonance RF irradiation pulse to measure MT. The resulting transverse relaxation (T2) spectra yielded four components corresponding to three nerve compartments, taken to result from myelinic, axonal, and inter-axonal water, and a fourth corresponding to the buffer solution water in which the nerve sample was bathed. Each nerve component was analysed for T1 relaxation and MT. All three nerve T2 components exhibited unique T1 relaxation and MT characteristics, providing further support for the assignment of the components to unique physical compartments of water. Numerical investigation of T1sat measurements of each of the three nerve T2 components indicates that while the two shorter-lived exhibit similar steady-state magnetisation transfer ratios (MTRs), their respective MT properties are quite different. Simulations demonstrate that mobile water exchange between these two components is not necessary to explain their similar steady-state MTR. In the context of the assignment of these two components to signal from myelinic and axonal water, this is to say that these two microanatomical regions of nerve may exhibit similar steady-state MTR characteristics despite possessing widely different MT exchange rates. Therefore, interpreting changes in MTR solely to reflect a change in degree of myelination could lead to erroneous conclusions.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The immune system plays a pivotal role in nerve injury. The aim of  this study was to determine the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluation of the synergic effect of immunomodulation on nerve regeneration in neurotmesis. METHODS: Rats with sciatic nerve neurotmesis and surgical repair underwent serial multiparametric MR examinations over an 8-week period after subepineurial microinjection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequent subcutaneous injection of FK506 or subepineurial microinjection of LPS or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone. RESULTS: Nerves treated with immunomodulation showed more prominent regeneration than those treated with LPS or PBS alone and more rapid restoration toward normal T2, fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial diffusivity (RD) values than nerves injected with LPS or PBS. DISCUSSION: Nerves treated with immunomodulation exert synergic beneficial effects on nerve regeneration that can be predicted by T2 measurements and FA and RD values. Muscle Nerve 57: E38-E45, 2018.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: It is widely accepted that peripheral nerve repairs performed within 6  weeks of injury have much better outcomes than those performed at later dates. However, there is no diagnostic technique that can determine if a traumatic peripheral nerve injury requires surgical intervention in the early postinjury phase. The objective of this article was to determine whether novel, noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging techniques could demonstrate the microstructure of human peripheral nerves that is necessary for determining prognosis and determining if surgery is indicated following traumatic injury. METHODS: Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging protocols were developed on a 9.4-T research scanner using spin-echo proton density and gradient-echo imaging sequences and a specially designed, inductively coupled radio frequency coil. These imaging protocols were applied to in situ imaging of the human median nerve in 4 fresh-frozen cadaver arms. RESULTS: Noninvasive high-resolution images of the human median nerve were obtained. Structures in the nerve that were observed included fascicles, interfascicular epineurium, perineurium, and intrafascicular septations. CONCLUSION: Application of these imaging techniques to clinical scanners could provide physicians with a tool that is capable of grading the severity of nerve injuries and providing indications for surgery in the early postinjury phase.

N2  - Here, we report the structural evidence of cerebral white matter abnormalities in  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) patients and the relationship between these abnormalities and clinical disability. Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in CMT patients with demyelinating (CMT1A/CMT1E), axonal (CMT2A/CMT2E), or intermediate (CMTX1/DI-CMT) peripheral neuropathy. Although all patients had normal brain magnetic resonance imaging, all genetic subgroups except CMT1A had abnormal DTI findings indicative of significant cerebral white matter abnormalities: decreased fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity, and increased radial diffusivity. DTI abnormalities were correlated with clinical disability, suggesting that there is comorbidity of central nervous system damage with peripheral neuropathy in CMT patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Neuro-axonal injury is a key contributor to non-reversible long-term  disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Visual impairment is common among MS patients, in which episodes of optic neuritis (ON) are often followed by structural retinal damage and sustained functional impairment. Alterations in the optic nerve and retina have also been described in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of MS. Thus, investigating structural anterior visual pathway damage may constitute a unique model for assessing mechanisms and temporal sequence of neurodegeneration in MS. We used a multimodal imaging approach utilizing optical coherence tomography (OCT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to explore the mechanisms and temporal dynamics of visual pathway damage in the animal model of MS. METHODS: 7 EAE-MOG(35-55) and 5 healthy female C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness was derived from an OCT volume scan centred over the optic nerve head, while the structure of the optic nerve and tracts was assessed from DTI and co-registered T2-weighted sequences performed on a 7T MRI scanner. Data was acquired at baseline, disease onset, peak of disease and recovery. Linear mixed effect models were used to account for intra-subject, inter-eye dependencies, group and time point. Correlation analyses assessed the relationship between GCC thickness and DTI parameters. Immunofluorescence staining of retina and optic nerve sections was used to assess distribution of marker proteins for microglia and neurodegeneration (nerve filaments). RESULTS: In EAE mice, a significant increase in GCC thickness was observed at disease onset (p < 0.001) followed by a decrease at recovery (p < 0.001) compared to controls. The EAE group had significant GCC thinning at recovery compared to all other time points (p < 0.001 for each). Signal increase on T2-weighted images around the optic nerves indicative of inflammation was seen in most of the EAE mice but in none of the controls. A significant decrease in axial diffusivity (AD) and increase in radial diffusivity (RD) values in EAE optic nerves (AD: p = 0.02, RD: p = 0.01) and tract (AD: p = 0.02, RD: p = 0.006) was observed compared to controls. GCC at recovery was positively correlated with AD (optic nerve: rho = 0.74, p = 0.04, optic tract: rho = 0.74, p = 0.04) and negatively correlated with RD (optic nerve: rho = -0.80, p = 0.02, optic tract: rho = -0.75, p = 0.04). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated the presence of activated microglia in the retina and optic nerves in addition to astrocytosis and axonal degeneration in the optic nerve of EAE mice. CONCLUSION: OCT detected GCC changes in EAE may resemble what is observed in MS-related acute ON: an initial phase of swelling (indicative of inflammatory edema) followed by a decrease in thickness over time (representative of neuro-axonal degeneration). In line with OCT findings, DTI of the visual pathway identifies EAE induced pathology (decreased AD, and increased RD). Immunofluorescence analysis provides support for inflammatory pathology and axonal degeneration. OCT together with DTI can detect retinal and optic nerve damage and elucidate to the temporal sequence of neurodegeneration in this rodent model of MS in vivo.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Piriformis muscle syndrome (PMS) is underdiagnosed. To evaluate the  potential of diffusion tensor imaging and diffusion tensor tractography as innovative tools for the diagnosis of PMS by functional assessment of the sciatic nerve, the aims of this study are to assess the reproducibility and to evaluate the changes in the parameters at levels proximal and distal to the piriformis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the sciatic nerve at three levels were quantified twice each by two examiners using the fiber-tracking method. In the first part of the study, laterality and reproducibility were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) in ten healthy volunteers. In the second part of the study, the healthy side and symptomatic side were assessed in ten consecutive patients with sciatica. There were three patients with no findings on lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: There was no laterality in either FA or ADC values in asymptomatic patients at any level. The mean intra-rater ICC was 0.90 and the mean inter-rater ICC was 0.87. FA was significantly lower and ADC significantly higher on the symptomatic side at each level in patients with sciatica. In the three sciatica patients with no findings on lumbar MRI, FA was significantly lower and ADC was significantly higher only at levels distal to the piriformis. These patients experienced full pain relief after ultrasound-guided injection of local anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging and diffusion tensor tractography might be innovative tools for the diagnosis of PMS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Small peripheral nerve tractography is challenging because of the  trade-off among resolution, image acquisition time, and signal-to-noise ratio. PURPOSE: To optimize pixel size and slice thickness parameters for fiber tractography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers (mean age 30 ± 6.8 years) were recruited prospectively. Axial T2-weighted and DTI scans were acquired, covering the cubital tunnel, using different pixel sizes and slice thicknesses. Three-dimensional (3D) nerve tractography was evaluated for the median number and length of the reconstructed fiber tracts and visual score from 0 to 5. Two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional DTI was evaluated for fractional anisotropy (FA) values throughout the length of the ulnar nerve. RESULTS: A pixel size of 1.3 mm(2) revealed the highest number of reconstructed nerve fibers compared to that of 1.1 mm(2) (P = 0.048), with a good visual score. A slice thickness of 4 mm had the highest number of reconstructed nerve fibers and visual score compared with other thicknesses (all P < 0.05). In 2D cross-sectional images, the median FA values were in the range of 0.40-0.63 at the proximal, central, and distal portions of the cubital tunnel. Inter-observer agreement for all parameters was good to excellent. CONCLUSION: For fiber tractography and DTI of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel, optimal image quality was obtained using a 1.3-mm(2) pixel size and 4-mm slice thickness under MR parameters of this study at 3T.

N2  - PURPOSE: Which infants with brachial plexus birth palsy (BPBP) should undergo  microsurgical plexus reconstruction remains controversial. The current gold standard for the decision for plexus reconstruction is serial clinical examinations, but this approach obviates the possibility of early surgical treatment. We hypothesize that a new technique using 3-dimensional volumetric proton density magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without sedation can evaluate the severity of BPBP injury earlier than serial clinical examinations. METHODS: Infants were prospectively enrolled prior to 12 weeks of age and imaged using 3 Tesla MRI without sedation. Clinical scores were collected at all visits. The imaging findings were graded based on the number of injured levels and the severity of each injury, and a radiological score was calculated. All infants were followed at least until the decision for surgery was made based on clinical examination. RESULTS: Nine infants completed the MRI scan and clinical follow-up. The average Toronto score at presentation was 4.4 out of 10 (range, 0-8.2); the average Active Movement Scale score was 50 out of 105 (range, 0-86). Four infants required surgery: 2 because of a flail limb and Horner syndrome and 2 owing to failure to recover antigravity elbow flexion by age 6 months. Radiological scores ranged from 0 to 18 out of a maximum score of 25. The average radiological score for those infants who required surgery was 12 (range, 6.5-18), whereas the average score for infants who did not require surgery was 3.5 (range, 0-8). CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional proton density MRI can evaluate spinal nerve roots in infants without the need for radiation, contrast agents, or sedation. These data suggest that MRI can help determine the severity of injury earlier than clinical examination in infants with BPBP, although further study of a larger sample of infants with varying severity of disease is necessary. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic II.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: To investigate the correlation of microstructural parameters with CSF  pressure and macroscopic changes assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). METHODS: Twenty-three patients with IIH as well as age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls underwent high resolution MR imaging of the optic nerve sheaths (ONS), pituitary gland, and ventricles. For DTI data a voxelwise permutation analysis was performed for the whole brain and ROI analysis was performed for the optic nerve and optic radiation. DTI measurements were correlated to morphometric measurements, CSF opening pressure, and headache intensity. The reliability of diagnostic performance of DTI parameters was assessed using ROC analysis. RESULTS: Analysis of DTI metrics revealed a significant reduction in the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the optic nerve in patients with IIH. In contrast, systematic regional variations between IIH patients and controls were neither observed in the whole brain analysis nor in the optic radiation. FA values of the optic nerve show significant correlations with the optic nerve sheath diameter (P = .003, r = -.589). The correlation of the alterations of the FA values of the optic radiation and the whole brain do not show a significant association to morphometric alterations in the ONS diameter and hypophysis height as well as to CSF opening pressure and headache intensity. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that IIH is associated with microstructural changes in the optic nerve. These alterations may be the direct consequence of chronically elevated intracranial pressure.

N2  - PURPOSE: To develop a highly efficient magnetic field gradient coil for head imaging  that achieves 200 mT/m and 500 T/m/s on each axis using a standard 1 MVA gradient driver in clinical whole-body 3.0T MR magnet. METHODS: A 42-cm inner diameter head-gradient used the available 89- to 91-cm warm bore space in a whole-body 3.0T magnet by increasing the radial separation between the primary and the shield coil windings to 18.6 cm. This required the removal of the standard whole-body gradient and radiofrequency coils. To achieve a coil efficiency ~4× that of whole-body gradients, a double-layer primary coil design with asymmetric x-y axes, and symmetric z-axis was used. The use of all-hollow conductor with direct fluid cooling of the gradient coil enabled ≥50 kW of total heat dissipation. RESULTS: This design achieved a coil efficiency of 0.32 mT/m/A, allowing 200 mT/m and 500 T/m/s for a 620 A/1500 V driver. The gradient coil yielded substantially reduced echo spacing, and minimum repetition time and echo time. In high b = 10,000 s/mm(2) diffusion, echo time (TE) < 50 ms was achieved (>50% reduction compared with whole-body gradients). The gradient coil passed the American College of Radiology tests for gradient linearity and distortion, and met acoustic requirements for nonsignificant risk operation. CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-high gradient coil performance was achieved for head imaging without substantial increases in gradient driver power in a whole-body 3.0T magnet after removing the standard gradient coil. As such, any clinical whole-body 3.0T MR system could be upgraded with 3-4× improvement in gradient performance for brain imaging.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To present in vivo female pelvic autonomous innervation and the  relationship between nerves and their related organs by three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Thirty patients with cervical cancer who underwent pelvic MRI and agreed to undergo additional magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) sequences were enrolled in the present study. MRI images from the same patient were acquired using T2-weighted fat saturation (T2W FS) and 3D-STIR-SPACE sequences. Detailed two-dimensional (2D) segmentation and 3D reconstruction of pelvic autonomic nerves (PAN) were performed on the basis of the images of the two sequences using 3D reconstruction software. The 2D segmentation and 3D reconstruction of pelvic organs were based on T2W FS images. The consistency of the 3D models of pelvic autonomous innervation constructed from the two sequences were analysed and compared, the pelvic autonomous innervation was presented, and the relationship between nerves and their related organs was characterised. RESULTS: The 3D reconstructions of PAN were successfully obtained from 3D-STIR-SPACE and T2W FS sequences in 30 patients and showed high correspondence. T2W FS images also enabled 3D reconstructions of pelvic organs to visualise the 3D distribution of PAN and the positional relationships between nerves and their related organs. CONCLUSION: The pelvic autonomic nerves and their related organs can be reconstructed on the basis of MRI to present personalised 3D anatomical information and offer individualised guidance during nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (NSRH). KEY POINTS: • Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy is a developing trend in cervical cancer surgery • MRI allows reconstructions of pelvic autonomic nerves and their related organs • The 3D reconstructions provide detailed 3D anatomical information on nerves.

N2  - This study aims to find accurate angles and depths of lateral ventricle puncture  using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reconstruction, as well as to provide an optimized and alternative puncturing strategy.A total of 90 computed tomography (CT) images and 30 CT images with DTI were analyzed. The measurements were performed on coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes. Some distances and angles were measured to determine the best angle and penetration depth during the puncture process. Important landmarks of the lateral ventricle were also measured, and a comparison of the differences between 2 hemispheres was also assessed.It showed that the vertical distance from the superior margin to inferior margin of the lateral ventricle was 22.2 ± 0.5 mm and the length was 124.1 ± 2.1 mm. In the frontal horn puncture approach, the penetration depth should be limited between 105.2 and 109.4 mm, the angle should be 71.6 ± 2.7°. During the occipital horn puncture approach, puncturing depth was from 90.7 to 111.4 mm, and angle was 15.3 ± 1.8°. Through the parietal lobe puncture approach, which was firstly brought out in this study, the puncturing length should be 124.4 to 130.2 mm and angle was 56.6 ± 2.0°.The traditional recommended protocol of lateral ventricle puncture is not accurate, the refined lateral ventricle puncture protocol established in this study will reduce injury and remain function. A DTI imaging examination combining with nerve fibers reconstruction were strongly recommended before lateral ventricle puncture, which will help neurosurgeons to determine the best puncturing angles and depth.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A number of benign and malignant peripheral nerve tumor and  tumorlike conditions produce similar imaging features on conventional anatomic MR imaging. Functional MR imaging using DTI can increment the diagnostic performance in differentiation of these lesions. Our aim was to evaluate the role of 3T anatomic MR imaging and DTI in the characterization of peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (13 men, 16 women; mean age, 41±18 years; range, 11-83 years) with a nerve tumor or tumorlike condition (25 benign, 5 malignant) underwent 3T MR imaging by using anatomic (n=29), functional diffusion, DWI (n=21), and DTI (n=24) techniques. Images were evaluated for image quality (3-point scale), ADC of the lesion, tractography, and fractional anisotropy of nerves with interobserver reliability in ADC and FA measurements. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in age (benign, 40±18 versus malignant, 45±19 years) and sex (benign, male/female=12:12 versus malignant, male/female=3:2) (P>.05). All anatomic (29/29, 100%) MR imaging studies received "good" quality; 20/21 (95%) DWI and 21/24 (79%) DTI studies received "good" quality. ADC of benign lesions (1.848±0.40×10(-3) mm2/s) differed from that of malignant lesions (0.900±0.25×10(-3) mm2/s, P<.001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC=0.988 [95% CI, 0.976-0.994]). There were no FA or ADC differences between men and women (P>.05). FA of involved nerves was lower than that in contralateral healthy nerves (P<.001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC=0.970 [95% CI, 0.946-0.991]). ADC on DTI and DWI was not statistically different (P>.05), with excellent intermethod reliability (ICC=0.943 [95% CI, 0.836-0.980]). Tractography differences were observed in benign and malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS: 3T MR imaging and DTI are valuable methods for anatomic and functional evaluation of peripheral nerve lesions with excellent interobserver reliability. While tractography and low FA provide insight into neural integrity, low diffusivity values indicate malignancy in neural masses.

N2  - MR-based brain imaging technologies provide a suite of functional and structural  metrics that can be used to test hypotheses about the CNS mechanisms underlying pain perception and chronification, from a cellular level to a systems level. Two types of functional MRI discussed in this review provide insight into pain mechanisms: stimulus-evoked fMRI and task-free ("resting state") fMRI. The former can assess how the brain responds to noxious or non-noxious stimuli normally or in a chronic pain state as a window into understanding pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. The latter can assess functional connectivity reflecting synchronous ultra-slow frequency oscillation between brain areas. This provides insight into how brain areas work together as networks to produce pain and how these networks may be modified due to chronic pain. Perfusion MR (e.g., arterial spin labeling) can also provide task-free information pertaining to ongoing brain activity that may reflect spontaneous (ongoing) chronic pain. Structural MR techniques can be used to delineate gray and white matter abnormalities and markers of neuroinflammation associated with chronic pains. Functional and structural MRI findings point to brain and peripheral nerve abnormalities in patients with chronic pain, some of which are pre-existing and others that develop with prolonged pain (and related neuroinflammation) over time. Recent studies indicate that some structural brain abnormalities associated with chronic pain are reversible following effective pain treatment. These data together with findings from studies of individual differences suggest that some chronic pains arise from a combination of pre-existing vulnerabilities and sustained abnormal input.

N2  - Loss of neural structures (such as hair cells or neurones within the spiral  ganglion) has been proposed to be involved in Menière's disease (MD) (Spoendlin et al. Acta oto-laryngologica Supplementum 499:1-21, 1; Merchant et al. Eur Arch Oto-Rhino-Laryngol Off J Eur Feder Oto-Rhino-Laryngol Soc (EUFOS) Affil German Soc Oto-Rhino-Laryngol Head Neck Surg 252(2):63-75, 2; Tsuji et al. Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol Suppl 81:26-31, 3; Kariya, Otol Neurotol Off Publ Am Otol Soc Am Neurotol Soc Eur Acad Otol Neurotol 28(8):1063-1068, 4; Megerian Laryngoscope 115(9):1525-1535, 5) but this has yet to be confirmed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate morphometric changes of VIIth and VIIIth cranial nerve in MD. MD is characterized by episodic vertigo, tinnitus, fluctuating hearing loss, and aural fullness. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms involved such as viral infections, autoimmune processes, genetic predisposition, cellular apoptosis, and oxidative stress are still not clear. Using a T2-weighted 3D-GE "constructive interference in steady state" (CISS) 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence, we evaluated the properties of the VIIth and VIIIth cranial nerves as they passed from the cerebellopontine angle to the inner ear modiolus. 21 patients with MD were examined along with 39 normal controls. Bidirectional nerve diameters and cross-sectional areas (CSA) were measured in a transverse plane. The comparison of study and control group showed statistically significant (P < 0.000595 after Bonferroni correction) differences between the CSA measurements. The facial, cochlear, superior vestibular, and inferior vestibular nerves (FN, CN, SVN, IVN) of MD patients were significantly larger than those of the control group, both on the MD-affected side and on the healthy side. Thus for example, the cochlear nerve CSA measurements were 0.69 ± 0.14 mm(2) (P < 0.0001) in the affected ears of the unilateral MD group, 0.70 ± 0.12 mm(2) (P < 0.0001) in the affected ears of the cohort including the bilateral MD group, 0.71 ± 0.13 mm(2) (P < 0.0001) in the non-affected ears of the MD patients, as compared to 0.46 ± 0.14 mm(2) in the control group. The perpendicular nerve diameters were found to vary according to site of measurement and type of measurement used. For example a statistically significant enlargement of the short diameter measurements of the SVN at the level of the meatus was found, but not of long diameter measurements at the same site. Although cellular death would theoretically be expected to lead to a decreased nerve thickness, our data showed a swelling of cranial nerves VII and VIII within the study group compared to our normal hearing control group. The similar reaction of the facial nerve supports mediator-based theories of MD pathophysiology.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Segmentation of whole-body MRI (WBMRI) to assess the feasibility,  quantitate the total tumor volume (tumor burden) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and examine associations with demographic, disease-related and anthropomorphic features. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with NF1 underwent WBMRI and were reviewed for tumors. Tumors were segmented using a semiautomated software-based tool. Tumors were classified as superficial or deep and discrete or plexiform. Segmentation times were recorded. Segmentation yielded the quantity and tumor burden of superficial, internal and plexiform tumors. Correlations between segmentation data and demographic, disease-related and anthropomorphic features were examined. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were evaluated (42.3 ± 13.6 years, 10 female, 5 male). Segmentation times were a median of 30 min and yielded 2,328 tumors (1,582 superficial, 746 internal and 23 plexiform). One tumor was malignant. Tumor counts ranged from 14 to 397. Tumor burden ranged from 6.95 cm3 to 571 cm3. Individual tumor volume ranged from 0.0120 cm3 to 298 cm3. Significant correlation was found between the total volume of superficial tumors and height (ρ = 0.5966, p < 0.02). Male patients had higher overall tumor burdens (p < 0.05) and higher superficial tumor burden (p < 0.03). Patients with negative family history had more tumors (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Segmentation of WBMRI in patients with NF1 is feasible and elucidates meaningful relationships among disease phenotype, anthropomorphic and demographic features.

N2  - PURPOSE: Peripheral neuropathies are a group of disorders which affect the  peripheral nervous system which have been conventionally diagnosed using electrodiagnostic studies. This study was carried out to assess the role of imaging in diagnosing peripheral mononeuropathy as exact anatomical localisation of the pathology is possible using high-resolution ultrasound and MR neurography, the modalities assessed in this study. METHOD: A hospital-based prospective analytical study was carried out in a resource-limited setting on 180 peripheral nerves in 131 patients with symptoms of peripheral mononeuropathy after taking IRB approval. Each patient underwent high-resolution ultrasound examination and MR neurography, findings of which were then compared and statistically analysed assuming electrodiagnostic findings as the gold standard. RESULTS: Overall, the diagnostic accuracy was highest for the proton density fat-saturated MR sequence (93.89%) followed by high-resolution ultrasound (80%). The sensitivity was highest for proton density fat-saturated sequence while the T1 MR sequence had the highest specificity. Combined diagnostic accuracy of both modalities was calculated to be 93.33% with a negative predictive value of 80%. High-resolution ultrasound and MRI equally detected the cases with nerve discontinuity, while neuromas were better identified on MRI. CONCLUSION: With the advent of higher frequency probes and improved MR field strength, imaging of peripheral nerves is possible with better accuracy. Imaging assessment of nerves allows anatomical delineation with identification of exact site of involvement. This comparative study demonstrates the role of imaging in diagnosing peripheral nerve pathologies with the accuracy of MRI as high as 93.89% which may serve as an imaging gold standard. High-resolution ultrasound, being quicker, cost effective and a comparable accuracy of 80% can serve as a reliable screening tool. This study incorporates a larger study group and compares HRUS with MRI, taking NCV as gold standard, which has not been done in the preceding studies. With this study, we conclude that these two imaging modalities are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they complement each other and can be used in conjunction as an imaging yardstick for diagnosing peripheral neuropathies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) has hitherto been considered a  disease of the peripheral nervous system only, with central nervous system (CNS) involvement largely overlooked. The aim of this study was to investigate any differences in brain structure in subjects with DPN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-six subjects with type 1 diabetes (No DPN [n = 18], Painful DPN [n = 9], Painless DPN [n = 9]) underwent neurophysiological assessment to quantify the severity of DPN. All subjects, including 18 healthy volunteers (HVs), underwent volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. RESULTS: Adjusted peripheral gray matter volume was statistically significantly lower in subjects with painless and painful DPN (mean 599.6 mL [SEM 9.8 mL] and 585.4 mL [10.0 mL], respectively) compared with those with No DPN (626.5 mL [5.7 mL]) and HVs (639.9 mL [7.2 mL]; ANCOVA, P = 0.001). The difference in adjusted peripheral gray matter volume between subjects with No DPN and HVs and those with Painful DPN and Painless DPN was not statistically significant (P = 0.16 and 0.30, respectively). Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed greater localized volume loss in the primary somatosensory cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and cingulate cortex (corrected P < 0.05) in DPN subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to focus on structural changes in the brain associated with DPN. Our findings suggest increased peripheral gray matter volume loss, localized to regions involved with somatosensory perception in subjects with DPN. This may have important implications for the long-term prognosis of DPN.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent neuroimaging studies have reported grey matter alterations in  primary trigeminal neuralgia patients. However, few studies have focused on quantitative measurements of trigeminal nerves and the interaction between trigeminal nerve volume and brain morphology, particularly grey matter volume. In this study, we investigated the link between trigeminal nerves and grey matter volume changes in primary trigeminal neuralgia patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, we explored the association of structure of trigeminal nerves and grey matter to collected pain clinical variables. METHODS: Eighty participants (40 patients and 40 controls) were recruited for the study. All participants underwent MRI sessions and clinical pain assessment. Trigeminal nerve volume and whole brain grey matter volume were evaluated using quantitative imaging techniques. Sensory and affective pain rating indices were assessed using the visual analog scale and short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire. Mediation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between clinical pain variables and volumetric changes in trigeminal nerves and grey matter. RESULTS: Decreased trigeminal nerve volume was detected in primary trigeminal neuralgia patients compared to controls. Additionally, reduced grey matter volume was found in several regions associated with pain in primary trigeminal neuralgia subjects, including the insula, secondary somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and several areas of the temporal lobe. Mediation analysis revealed that decreased trigeminal nerve volume drove grey matter volume abnormality of the left insula, and further led to increased pain ratings. CONCLUSION: This study showed a predominantly direct effect of trigeminal nerve atrophy on clinical pain variables in primary trigeminal neuralgia patients, providing new insight into the pathophysiology of the disease.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively assess carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) with DTI by  evaluating two approaches to determine cut-off values. METHODS: In forty patients with CTS diagnosis confirmed by nerve conduction studies (NCs) and 14 healthy subjects (mean age 58.54 and 57.8 years), cross-sectional area (CSA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) at single and multiple levels with intraobserver agreement were evaluated. RESULTS: Maximum and mean CSA and FA showed significant differences between healthy subjects and patients (12.85 mm(2) vs. 28.18 mm(2), p < 0.001, and 0.613 vs. 0.524, p=0.007, respectively) (10.12 mm(2) vs. 19.9 mm(2), p<0.001 and 0.617 vs. 0.54, p=0.003, respectively), but not maximum and mean ADC (p > 0.05). For cut-off values, mean and maximum CSA showed the same sensitivity and specificity (93.3 %). However, mean FA showed better sensitivity than maximum FA (82.6 % vs. 73.9 %), but lower specificity (66.7 % vs. 80 %), and significant correlation for maximum CSA, 97 % (p < 0.01), with good correlation for maximum ADC and FA, 84.5 % (p < 0.01) and 62 % (p=0.056), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CSA and FA showed significant differences between healthy subjects and patients. Single measurement at maximum CSA is suitable for FA determination. Key Points • DTI showed that FA is stronger than ADC for CTS diagnosis. • Single- and multiple-level approaches were compared to determine FA and ADC. • Single-level evaluation at the thickest MN cross-sectional area is sufficient.

MR diffusion imaging is shown to effectively allow determination of the presence of anisotropic water diffusion in animal and human cerebral and spinal white matter and in peripheral nerves. In another important application, the measured apparent water proton diffusion is observed to be significantly slowed in cerebral gray matter within the first minutes following experimental stroke suggesting that MRI could be useful in rapid initial assessments of ischemic damage. MR contrast media can cause regional changes due to either magnetic susceptibility-induced T2* shortening or to paramagnetic-induced T1 shortening. The passage of a contrast bolus through the microcirculation can be monitored using high-speed MRI and can provide significant contrast enhancement in ischemic and normally perfused tissues.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of whole-body magnetic resonance neurography  (WBMRN) in polyneuropathy for technical feasibility, distribution of nerve abnormalities, and differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty WBMRN examinations were performed on a 3T scanner over 2 years. Patient demographics including history of hereditary and acquired neuropathy were recorded. The images were evaluated by two independent readers with nerve imaging experience for quality. The nerve signal and size alterations were measured in the brachial plexus, lumbosacral plexus, and femoral and sciatic nerves; diffusion tensor imaging parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA] and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) were determined in plexuses, and tractography was performed. Nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were obtained. RESULTS: Excellent image quality was obtained for the majority of lumbosacral (LS) plexus (18/20) and 50% of brachial plexus (10/20) regions. Qualitatively among cases, the nerve hyperintensity and/or thickening involved the brachial plexus (11/11), LS plexus (7/11), and both plexuses (7/11), with most nerve thickenings observed in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1. The nerve signal intensity alterations were significantly different for both brachial (P < 0.05) and LS (P < 0.05) plexuses in cases versus controls. The femoral and sciatic nerve size alterations were different (P < 0.05), while signal intensity differences were not significant (P = 0.1-0.97). Transverse dimensions of C8 (4 mm), L5 (6.2 mm) and S1 (5.1 mm) nerve roots, and sciatic nerves (10.2 mm) were the most accurate diagnostic performance measures in distinguishing cases from controls. CONCLUSION: WBMRN is feasible for use in the clinical practice for the identification and potential characterization of polyneuropathy. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;44:1513-1521.

N2  - Growing evidence indicates that alterations within the peripheral nervous system  (PNS) are involved at an early stage in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenetic cascade. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neurophysiologic analyses, and histologic analyses were used to monitor the extent of PNS damage in the hSOD-1 ALS rat model. The imaging signature of the disease was defined using in vivo MRI of the sciatic nerve. Initial abnormalities were detected in the nerves by an increase in T2 relaxation time before the onset of clinical disease; diffusion MRI showed a progressive increase in mean and radial diffusivity and reduction of fractional anisotropy at advanced stages of disease. Histologic analysis demonstrated early impairment of the blood-nerve barrier followed by acute axonal degeneration associated with endoneurial edema and macrophage response in motor nerve compartments. Progressive axonal degeneration and motor nerve fiber loss correlated with MRI and neurophysiologic changes. These functional and morphologic investigations of the PNS might be applied in following disease progression in preclinical therapeutic studies. This study establishes the PNS signature in this rat ALS model (shedding new light into pathogenesis) and provides a rationale for translating into future systematic MRI studies of PNS involvement in patients with ALS.

N2  - Central nervous system involvement has been described in peripheral neuropathies,  including different forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The aim of our study was to systematically investigate possible brain structural modifications in CMT1A patients, using volumetric MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this prospective cross-sectional study, from May 2017 to May 2019, we acquired 3T MRI brain scans of genetically confirmed CMT1A patients and age- and sex-comparable healthy controls. Patients also underwent clinical and electrophysiological examinations assessing motor and sensory domains. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were performed using a non-parametric approach based on permutations, including age and sex (and total intracranial volume for VBM) as nuisance covariates. When between-group differences emerged at VBM or TBSS analyses, the first eigenvariate was extracted from the cluster and its age- and sex-adjusted standardized residuals tested for correlation with clinical and electrophysiological variables. Twenty CMT1A patients (34.5 ± 11.1 years; M/F:11/9) were enrolled, along with 20 healthy controls (30.1 ± 10.2 years; M/F:11/9). The VBM analysis revealed clusters of significantly increased GM volume in CMT1A patients compared to healthy controls, encompassing the bilateral cerebellar lobules III-VI and the left hippocampus (all ps = 0.04), with no differences in terms of DTI metrics at the TBSS analysis. A negative correlation (r = -0.502, p = 0.03) emerged between ulnar compound motor action potential and the z-scores corresponding to the right cerebellar cluster of augmented GM volume. Our data show evidence of structural reorganization in the brain of CMT1A patients, possibly reflecting neural plasticity mechanisms in response to peripheral nerve pathology and modulating the effect of axonal degeneration on functional impairment.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate 22 histologically proven  peripheral nerve sheath tumors, approximately two-thirds of which arose in the lower extremity. The histologic distribution was as follows: 12 schwannomas, 7 neurofibromas, and 3 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (2 of which occurred in patients with neurofibromatosis). Most lesions demonstrated an intermediate to moderately bright signal on T1-weighted images and were minimally inhomogeneous. All lesions were moderately bright on proton-density-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images, again with variable inhomogeneity. The extent of the tumor was best assessed on proton-density- and T2-weighted images. Smooth margins were noted in 19 lesions. Of the 3 remaining lesions, 2 were malignant (but had been subjected to biopsy prior to MRI), and the other lesion was a plexiform neurofibroma. MRI accurately determined the relationship between the lesion and the adjacent neurovascular structures and muscles, thereby assisting surgical management. On MRI, 5 lesions demonstrated coexistent subtle muscle atrophy along the longitudinal axis of surrounding or distally innervated musculature. This latter finding, together with the presence of a tumor in the vicinity of a large nerve trunk, suggests a peripheral nerve sheath neoplasm.

N2  - This study correlated morphologic abnormalities of idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome  (CTS) with the severity of CTS using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The relationship of the severity of CTS and the cross-sectional area of the median nerve (CSA) was assessed at several levels. Seventy wrists of 35 patients (27 women and 8 men) with unilateral idiopathic CTS underwent nerve conduction study and 3-T MRI of the wrist. The CSA at 4 levels (distal radioulnar joint, body of scaphoid, tubercule of scaphoid, and hook of hamate) and the thickness of the transverse carpal ligament at 3 levels in both affected and unaffected hands were measured using 3-T MRI and correlated with the severity of CTS assessed with distal motor latency. The CSA in the affected hand at the scaphoid body level was significantly higher than in the unaffected hand. The CSA at the scaphoid body level was positively correlated with distal motor latency in the affected hand. The CSA in the affected hand at the scaphoid tubercule level was significantly lower than in the unaffected hand. The CSA had a negative correlation with distal motor latency at the scaphoid tubercule level. The CSA at the distal radioulnar joint and the hamate hook was not significantly different between the affected hand and the unaffected hand. The CSA at the distal radioulnar joint level and hook level were not correlated significantly with distal motor latency in the affected hand. The mean CSA of the affected hand at the scaphoid body level was highest in 4 levels. [Orthopedics. 2017; 40(1):e77-e81.].

N2  - The ability to measure myelin in vivo has great consequences for furthering our  knowledge of normal development, as well as for understanding a wide range of neurological disorders. The following review summarizes the current state of myelin imaging using MR. We consider five MR techniques that have been used to study myelin: 1) conventional MR, 2) MR spectroscopy, 3) diffusion, 4) magnetization transfer, and 5) T2 relaxation. Fundamental studies involving peripheral nerve and MR/histology comparisons have aided in the interpretation and validation of MR data. We highlight a number of important findings related to myelin development, damage, and repair, and we conclude with a critical summary of the current techniques available and their potential to image myelin in vivo.

N2  - OBJECT The majority of growing and/or symptomatic peripheral nerve tumors are  schwannomas and neurofibromas. They are almost always benign and can usually be resected while minimizing motor and sensory deficits if approached with the proper expertise and techniques. Intraoperative electrophysiological stimulation and recording techniques allow the surgeon to map the surface of the tumor in an effort to identify and thus avoid damaging functioning nerve fibers. Recently, MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques have permitted the visualization of axons, because of their anisotropic properties, in peripheral nerves. The object of this study was to compare the distribution of nerve fibers as revealed by direct electrical stimulation with that seen on preoperative MR DTI. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with a peripheral nerve or nerve root tumor between March 2012 and January 2014. Diffusion tensor imaging and intraoperative data had been prospectively collected for patients with peripheral nerve tumors that were resected. Preoperative identification of the nerve fiber location in relation to the nerve tumor surface as seen on DTI studies was compared with the nerve fiber's intraoperative localization using electrophysiological stimulation and recordings. RESULTS In 23 patients eligible for study there was good correlation between nerve fiber location on DTI and its anatomical location seen intraoperatively. Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated the relationship of nerve fibers relative to the tumor with 95.7% sensitivity, 66.7% specificity, 75% positive predictive value, and 93.8% negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative DTI techniques are useful in helping the peripheral nerve surgeon to both determine the risks involved in resecting a nerve tumor and plan the safest surgical approach.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The current prognostic biomarker of functional outcome in  brachial plexus birth palsy is serial clinical examination throughout the first 6 months of age. This can delay surgical treatment and prolong parental anxiety in neonates who will recover spontaneously. A potentially superior biomarker is a volumetric proton density MRI performed at clinical presentation and within the first 12 weeks of life, providing a high spatial and contrast resolution examination in 4 minutes. METHODS: Nine neonates ranging in age from 4 to 9 weeks who presented with brachial plexus birth palsy were enrolled. All subjects underwent non-sedated 3 Tesla MRI with Cube Proton Density MRI sequence at the same time as their initial clinical visit. Serial clinical examinations were conducted at routine 4 week intervals and the functional performance scores were recorded. MRI findings were divided into pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic injuries and a radiological scoring system (Shriners Radiological Score) was developed for this study. RESULTS: Proton Density MRI was able to differentiate between pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic injuries. Radiological scores (Shriners Radiological Score) correlated better with functional performance at 6 months of age (P = .022) than the initial clinical examinations (Active Movement Scale P = .213 and Toronto P = .320). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid non-sedated volumetric Cube Proton Density MRI protocol performed at initial clinical presentation can accurately grade severity of brachial plexus birth palsy injury and predict functional performance at 6 months of age.

N2  - European Radiology Experimental reached the first 100 articles published in two  years. Rejection rate was 30%, publication rate increased from 3.5/month in the first 12-month period to 4.8/month in the second 12-month period. The journal metrics were: 25 days from submission to first decision, 96 days from submission to acceptance, and 69 days from acceptance to publication. At the end of May 2019, we accumulated a total of 82,367 article accesses, 541 Altmetric score, and 110 citations for 92 published articles. Europe accounted for 85% of article origin. One third of corresponding authors were not radiologists/radiology residents, but were rather mainly physicists, engineers, or computer scientists. The distribution among subspecialties/body parts was well balanced; 9% of the topics regarded patient's safety, radioprotection, or contrast media. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) accounted for 71% of the articles. Twenty-two percent of original articles/technical notes reported on animal models, 15% on phantoms, 3% on in silico, 2% on human cadavers, and 2% on cells. Nine articles regarded artificial intelligence and/or radiomics, and 2 regarded augmented reality. Of 100 articles, 57 declared funding sources. A total of 517 independent reviews were performed by 92 reviewers. The five articles quoted the most regarded augmented reality, spectral photon-counting CT, artificial intelligence, MRI radiomics, and diffusion tensor imaging of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems. The journal is complying with aims and scope of its "experimental" profile.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are complex, histologically benign  peripheral nerve sheath tumors that are challenging to measure by simple line measurements. Computer-aided volumetric segmentation of PN has become the recommended method to assess response in clinical trials directed at PN. Different methods for volumetric analysis of PN have been developed. The goal of this study is to test the level of agreement in volume measurements and in interval changes using two separate methods of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis. METHODS: Three independent volume measurements were performed on 15 PN imaged at three time-points using 3DQI software at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) and MEDx software at NCI. RESULTS: Median volume differences at each time-point comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were -0.5, -4.2, and -19.9 mL; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were -21.0, -47.0, and -21.0 mL; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were -10.0, -70.3, and -29.9 mL. Median differences in percentage change over time comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were -1.7, 1.1, and -1.0%; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were -2.3, 3.3, and -1.1%; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were -0.4, 2.0, and -1.5%. Volume differences were <20% of the mean of the two measurements in 117 of 135 comparisons (86.7%). Difference in interval change was <20% in 120 of the 135 comparisons (88.9%), while disease status classification was concordant in 115 of 135 comparisons (85.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The volumes, interval changes, and progression status classifications were in good agreement. The comparison of two volumetric analysis methods suggests no systematic differences in tumor assessment. A prospective comparison of the two methods is planned.

N2  - Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking is used for  3-dimensional visualization of the nervous system. Peripheral nerves and all cranial nerves, except for the olfactory tract, have previously been visualized. The olfactory tracts are difficult to depict with diffusion-weighted imaging due to the high sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts at the base of the skull. Here we report an optimized single-shot diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence that can visualize the olfactory tracts with fiber tracking. Five healthy individuals were examined, and the olfactory tracts could be fiber tracked with the diffusion-weighted sequence. For comparison and as a negative control, an anosmic patient was examined. No olfactory tracts were visualized on T2-weighted nor diffusion-weighted fiber tracking images. Measuring diffusion in the olfactory tracts promise to facilitate the identification of different hyposmic and anosmic conditions.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Spinal cord and peripheral nerves are classically known to be damaged  in Friedreich's ataxia, but the extent of cerebral involvement in the disease and its progression over time are not yet characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate longitudinally cerebral damage in Friedreich's ataxia. METHODS: We enrolled 31 patients and 40 controls, which were evaluated at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. To assess gray matter, we employed voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness measurements. White matter was evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging. Statistical analyses were both cross-sectional and longitudinal (corrected for multiple comparisons). RESULTS: Group comparison between patients and controls revealed widespread macrostructural differences at baseline: gray matter atrophy in the dentate nuclei, brainstem, and precentral gyri; and white matter atrophy in the cerebellum and superior cerebellar peduncles, brainstem, and periventricular areas. We did not identify any longitudinal volumetric change over time. There were extensive microstructural alterations, including superior cerebellar peduncles, corpus callosum, and pyramidal tracts. Longitudinal analyses identified progressive microstructural abnormalities at the corpus callosum, pyramidal tracts, and superior cerebellar peduncles after 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Patients with Friedreich's ataxia present more widespread gray and white matter damage than previously reported, including not only infratentorial areas, but also supratentorial structures. Furthermore, patients with Friedreich's ataxia have progressive microstructural abnormalities amenable to detection in a short-term follow-up.

N2  - Schwannomatosis is a distinct syndrome characterized by multiple peripheral nerve  schwannomas that can be sporadic or familial in nature. Cases affecting the lower cranial nerves are infrequent. Here, the authors present a rare case of schwannomatosis affecting the left spinal accessory nerve. Upon genetic screening, an in-frame insertion at codon p.R177 of the Sox 10 gene was observed. There were no identifiable alterations in NF1, NF2, LZTR1, and SMARCB1. This case demonstrates a rare clinical presentation of schwannomatosis in addition to a genetic aberration that has not been previously reported in this disease context.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging may reflect pathology of the optic  nerve; however, the ability of DTI to evaluate alterations of the optic nerve in retinitis pigmentosa has not yet been assessed, to our knowledge. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic potential of reduced FOV-DTI in optic neuropathy of retinitis pigmentosa at 3T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients and thirty-five healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Measures of visual field and visual acuity of both eyes in all subjects were performed. A reduced FOV-DTI sequence was used to derive fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, principal eigenvalue, and orthogonal eigenvalue of the individual optic nerves. Mean fractional anisotropy, ADC, and eigenvalue maps were obtained for quantitative analysis. Further analyses were performed to determine the correlation of fractional anisotropy, ADC, principal eigenvalue, and orthogonal eigenvalue with optic nerves in patients with mean deviation of the visual field and visual acuity, respectively. RESULTS: The optic nerves of patients with retinitis pigmentosa compared with control subjects showed significantly higher ADC, principal eigenvalue, and orthogonal eigenvalue and significantly lower fractional anisotropy (P < .01). For patients with retinitis pigmentosa, the mean deviation of the visual field of the optic nerve was significantly correlated with mean fractional anisotropy (r = 0.364, P = .001) and orthogonal eigenvalue (r = -0.254, P = .029), but it was not correlated with mean ADC (P = .154) and principal eigenvalue (P = .337). Moreover, no correlation between any DTI parameter and visual acuity in patients with retinitis pigmentosa was observed (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced FOV-DTI measurement of the optic nerve may serve as a biomarker of axonal and myelin damage in optic neuropathy for patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

N2  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is commonly used to evaluate white matter  integrity in multiple sclerosis (MS), but the relationship between DTI measures and functional changes during disease remains ambiguous. Using a mouse model of MS, we tested the hypothesis that DTI measures would correlate to the visual evoked potential (VEPs) dynamically at different disease stages. METHODS: In vivo DTI, gadolinium-enhanced T1WI (Gd-T1WI) and VEPs were performed in 5 control and 25 mice after 2-12 weeks of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). DTI indices, including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivities (AD and RD), and Gd-T1WI enhancement, were measured in the optic nerve and tract (ON and OT), which were compared with measured VEPs. RESULTS: Gd-T1WI showed a 3- to 4-fold enhancement over controls beginning after 2 weeks of EAE. Across the time course, we found progressive reductions in FA and increases in RD with increases in VEP latency and reductions in amplitude. Significant correlations between DTI (FA and RD) and VEP evolved; in control/early asymptomatic EAE mice, both FA and RD were highly correlated with VEP latency (but not amplitude), while in late EAE, both DTI indices were highly correlated with VEP amplitude (but not latency). CONCLUSION: DTI measures FA and RD are associated to VEP latency in early stages of EAE but associated to VEP amplitude in later stages, suggesting that the patterns of DTI related to the functional decline may depend on the stage of disease progression.

N2  - AIM: To assess the diagnostic value of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and  fractional anisotropy (FA) of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at several anatomical locations in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) to explore the optimal parameters and measurement location. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was conducted using the PubMed, EBSCO, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases to identify articles relevant to this study published before September 2017. Studies were selected and included according to strict eligibility criteria. Mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compare FA and ADC values between CTS patients and healthy subjects. Potential publication bias was investigated. RESULTS: Eleven studies involving 349 CTS wrists and 278 controls were selected for the meta-analysis. A notable MD: was found for lowered FA at the level of the pisiform bone for CTS versus controls (MD: -0.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.14 to -0.07, z=5.83, p<0.001). A higher ADC was found at the pisiform bone and hamate bone levels for CTS versus controls (P: MD: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.20, z=5.98, p<0.001, H: MD: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.21, z=4.67, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis demonstrated a significant FA reduction and ADC increase in CTS patients. This result supports the use of DTI parameters in differentiating CTS patients from health subjects. The anatomical site for FA at the pisiform and ADC at the pisiform and hamate levels were more accessible than other sites for the diagnosis of CTS patients.

N2  - The trigeminal nerve and nuclei (the trigeminal complex) are unique in the human  body with regard to their anatomical and physiological characteristics. They are also special regarding the lesions in which they are involved, both at the peripheral level because of the susceptibility of some terminal branches, and at the nuclei because of their large size and the large amount of connections with other centers. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging studies are often not sufficiently informative to demonstrate very tiny lesions that could be responsible for an important damage in the brainstem. Therefore, clinical neurophysiology and specifically, the techniques used in the study of the trigeminal functions, remain as convenient diagnostic and research tools to document clinically evident lesions or uncover subclinical abnormalities. This review is focussed on the clinical applicability of the study of trigeminal reflexes, including methods employed in the documentation of focal lesions of peripheral branches, trigeminal involvement of peripheral neuropathies, specific lesions of the trigeminal ganglia, central nervous dysfunctions causing abnormalities in the excitability of trigeminal neurons, and the possible use of trigeminal nerve reflexes in the study of facial pain syndromes and headache.

N2  - Various neurological problems of the brain are known to occur in patients with end  stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings in patients with ESRD. Using DTI, we attempted to investigate DTI findings in patients with ESRD who showed no specific lesions on conventional brain MRI. We recruited 10 consecutive patients with ESRD for whom at least 3 years had passed since the start of peritoneal dialysis and who showed no neurological abnormality on neurologic examination. We excluded 6 patients who showed cerebral infarct (4 patients) and diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy (2 patients); finally, 4 patients (39.75 ± 9.84 years) were included in this study. We evaluated hand motor function and cognition. DTI data were acquired using a 1.5-T Philips Gyroscan Intera system and diffusion tensor tractographies (DTTs) for five neural tracts (corticospinal tract, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus) were evaluated. With the exception of 1 patient who revealed a mild abnormality at a higher cognitive function, no abnormalities in motor and cognitive function were observed. Among the 10 DTTs, except for those of the corticospinal tract, all 4 patients had more than one lesion. Patients with ESRD showed abnormalities on DTTs that were associated with cognition; however, they did not show significant cognitive abnormalities.

N2  - MRI may provide treatment outcome measures in neuromuscular conditions. The authors  assessed MRI magnetisation transfer ratios (MTRs) in lower-limb musculature as markers of pathology in peripheral neuropathies and compared the findings with associated clinical data. Ten patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and nine patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) were compared with 10 healthy subjects. The MTR in the calf muscles was significantly lower than controls in the two patient groups (both p<0.001). The median MTRs (IQR) were 50.5(1.6) percentage units (p.u.) (control), 41.5(10.6) p.u. (CMT1A) and 39.3(8.7) p.u. (CIDP). Moreover, anterior lower leg MTR correlated strongly with strength of ankle dorsiflexion, measured with the Medical Research Council scale, in CIDP (ρ=0.88, p<0.001) and also in CMT1A (ρ=0.50, p<0.05), where MTR also showed an association with disease duration (ρ=-0.86, p<0.001). Short tau inversion recovery MRI of the same muscles showed abnormalities associated with regions of reduced MTR (p<0.001), and MTR was also reduced in other muscles otherwise deemed normal appearing (p<0.001), indicating that MTR may be more sensitive to muscle damaged by denervation than conventional MRI. The significant reductions in muscle MTR in peripheral neuropathies and the associated correlations with clinical measures indicate that MTR has potential as an imaging outcome measure in future therapeutic trials.

N2  - Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy is a rare, autosomal-dominant  inherited multisystem disorder usually manifesting with a rapidly progressive, axonal, distally-symmetric polyneuropathy. The detection of nerve injury by nerve conduction studies is limited, due to preferential involvement of small-fibres in early stages. We investigated whether lower limb nerve-injury can be detected, localized and quantified in vivo by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography. We prospectively included 20 patients (12 male and eight female patients, mean age 47.9 years, range 26-66) with confirmed mutation in the transthyretin gene: 13 with symptomatic polyneuropathy and seven asymptomatic gene carriers. A large age- and sex-matched cohort of healthy volunteers served as controls (20 male and 20 female, mean age 48.1 years, range 30-73). All patients received detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations and were scored using the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limbs, Neuropathy Deficit and Neuropathy Symptom Score. Magnetic resonance neurography (3 T) was performed with large longitudinal coverage from proximal thigh to ankle-level and separately for each leg (140 axial slices/leg) by using axial T2-weighted (repetition time/echo time = 5970/55 ms) and dual echo (repetition time 5210 ms, echo times 12 and 73 ms) turbo spin echo 2D sequences with spectral fat saturation. A 3D T2-weighted inversion-recovery sequence (repetition time/echo time 3000/202 ms) was acquired for imaging of the spinal nerves and lumbar plexus (50 axial slice reformations). Precise manual segmentation of the spinal/sciatic/tibial/common peroneal nerves was performed on each slice. Histogram-based normalization of nerve-voxel signal intensities was performed using the age- and sex-matched control group as normative reference. Nerve-voxels were subsequently classified as lesion-voxels if a threshold of >1.2 (normalized signal-intensity) was exceeded. At distal thigh level, where a predominant nerve-lesion-voxel burden was observed, signal quantification was performed by calculating proton spin density and T2-relaxation time as microstructural markers of nerve tissue integrity. The total number of nerve-lesion voxels (cumulated from proximal-to-distal) was significantly higher in symptomatic patients (20 405 ± 1586) versus asymptomatic gene carriers (12 294 ± 3199; P = 0.036) and versus controls (6536 ± 467; P < 0.0001). It was also higher in asymptomatic carriers compared to controls (P = 0.043). The number of nerve-lesion voxels was significantly higher at thigh level compared to more distal levels (lower leg/ankle) of the lower extremities (f-value = 279.22, P < 0.0001). Further signal-quantification at this proximal site (thigh level) revealed a significant increase of proton-density (P < 0.0001) and T2-relaxation-time (P = 0.0011) in symptomatic patients, whereas asymptomatic gene-carriers presented with a significant increase of proton-density only. Lower limb nerve injury could be detected and quantified in vivo on microstructural level by magnetic resonance neurography in symptomatic familial amyloid polyneuropathy, and also in yet asymptomatic gene carriers, in whom imaging detection precedes clinical and electrophysiological manifestation. Although symptoms start and prevail distally, the focus of predominant nerve injury and injury progression was found proximally at thigh level with strong and unambiguous lesion-contrast. Imaging of proximal nerve lesions, which are difficult to detect by nerve conduction studies, may have future implications also for other distally-symmetric polyneuropathies.

N2  - CONCLUSIONS: The size of cochlear nerve (CN) is atrophic in adult auditory  neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) patients compared with non-ANSD sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) patients and normal hearing subjects, and CN deficiency is one of the lesions for ANSD patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the dimensions of CN in adult ANSD patients on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and confirm the hypothesis that CN deficiency is one of the lesions for ANSD patients. METHODS: Medical records and MRI of 24 adult ANSD patients reviewed retrospectively and 20 non-ANSD SNHL and 24 volunteers with normal hearing were recruited as control groups. The long diameter (LD), short diameter (SD), and cross-sectional area (CSA) of CN and facial nerve (FN) were measured. RESULTS: Among the 24 ANSD patients, this study was able to reconstruct and measure the CN of 91.7% (22/24, total 43 ears) of patients and FN of 83.3% (20/24, total 38 ears) of patients. The mean values and standard deviations of LD, SD, and CSA of CN in ANSD patients were 0.65 ± 0.20 mm, 0.44 ± 0.15 mm, and 0.30 ± 0.19 mm(2), respectively. They were significantly smaller in ANSD patients than in control groups (p < 0.001).

N2  - The diagnostic workup and surgical therapy for peripheral nerve tumors and tumorlike  lesions are challenging. Magnetic resonance imaging is the standard diagnostic tool in the preoperative workup. However, even with advanced pulse sequences such as diffusion tensor imaging for MR neurography, the ability to differentiate tumor entities based on histological features remains limited. In particular, rare tumor entities different from schwannomas and neurofibromas are difficult to anticipate before surgical exploration and histological confirmation. High-resolution ultrasound (HRU) has become another important tool in the preoperative evaluation of peripheral nerves. Ongoing software and technical developments with transducers of up to 17-18 MHz enable high spatial resolution with tissue-differentiating properties. Unfortunately, high-frequency ultrasound provides low tissue penetration. The authors developed a setting in which intraoperative HRU was used and in which the direct sterile contact between the ultrasound transducer and the surgically exposed nerve pathology was enabled to increase structural resolution and contrast. In a case-guided fashion, the authors report the sonographic characteristics of rare tumor entities shown by intraoperative HRU and contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the  clinical setting as a complementary tool to conventional MRI in the study and assessment of the sciatic nerve and its pathologies. METHODS: 17 patients diagnosed with different types of sciatic neuropathy and 10 healthy controls underwent a conventional MRI and a DTI study in a 3-T MR scanner (Achieva(®) 3-T X-Series; Philips Healthcare, Netherlands). RESULTS: In the control group, we were able to track and visualize the common sciatic nerve and its main branches from hip to foot. In the patient group, the affected sciatic nerves presented statistically significant lower fractional anisotropy values and higher apparent diffusion coefficient values when compared with controls, suggesting nerve damage. In all cases, DTI offered complementary information for diagnosis and/or confirmation of the suspected pathology. When compared with conventional MRI, DTI showed higher sensitivity for nerve damage detection. CONCLUSION: DTI offers a significant improvement and an important complement to visualize the sciatic nerve and its main branches. In patients with sciatic nerve pathology DTI allows to a better detection and characterization of the nerve damage. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: DTI enables in vivo dissection of the sciatic nerve white matter fibres; its use offers a significant improvement and complement to conventional MRI.

N2  - We investigated the usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging using single-shot turbo  spin-echo sequence (TSE-DTI) in detecting the responsible nerve root by multipoint measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) values. Five patients with bilateral lumbar spinal stenosis showing unilateral neurological symptoms were examined using TSE-DTI. In the spinal canal, FA values in the symptomatic side were lower than those in the asymptomatic side. TSE-DTI using multipoint measurements of FA values can differentiate the responsible lumbar nerve root.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the potential of three-tesla diffusion tensor  imaging (DTI) and tractography to detect changes of the radial (RN) and median (MN) nerves during transient upper arm compression by a silicon ring tourniquet. METHODS: Axial T2-weighted and DTI sequences (b = 700 s/mm(2), 16 gradient encoding directions) of 13 healthy volunteers were obtained. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the MN and RN were measured at the spiral groove and further visualized in 3D by deterministic tractography (thresholds: FA = .15, angle change = 27°). RESULTS: Local/lesional RN FA values increased (p = 0.001) and ADC values decreased (p = 0.02) during a 20-min upper arm compression, whereas no significant FA (p = 0.49) or ADC (p = 0.73) changes of the MN were detected. There were no T2-w nerve signal changes or alterations of nerve trajectories in 3D. CONCLUSIONS: Acute nerve compression of the RN leads to changes of its three-tesla DTI metrics. Peripheral nerve DTI provides non-invasive insights into the "selective" vulnerability of the RN at the spiral groove. KEY POINTS: • DTI-based neurography detects nerve changes during acute nerve compression. • Compression leads to a transient increase in local radial nerve FA values. • DTI provides insights into radial nerve vulnerability at the spiral groove.

N2  - The outcomes from spinal nerve decompression surgery are highly variable with a  sizable proportion of elderly foraminal stenosis patients not regaining good pain relief. A better understanding of nerve root compression before and following decompression surgery and whether these changes are mirrored by improvements in symptoms may help to improve clinical decision-making processes. This case study used a combination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), clinical questionnaires and motor neurophysiology assessments before and up to 3 months following spinal decompression surgery. In this case report, a 70-year-old women with compression of the left L5 spinal nerve root in the L5-S1 exit foramina was recruited to the study. At 3 months following surgery, DTI revealed marked improvements in left L5 microstructural integrity to a similar level to that seen in the intact right L5 nerve root. This was accompanied by a gradual improvement in pain-related symptoms, mood and disability score by 3 months. Using this novel multimodal approach, it may be possible to track concurrent improvements in pain-related symptoms, function and microstructural integrity of compressed nerves in elderly foraminal stenosis patients undergoing decompression surgery.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse pelvic autonomous innervation with magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) in comparison with anatomical macroscopic dissection on cadavers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pelvic MRI was performed in eight adult human cadavers (five men and three women) using a total of four sequences each: T1, T1 fat saturation, T2, diffusion weighed. Images were analysed with segmentation software in order to extract nervous tissue. Key height points of the pelvis autonomous innervation were located in every specimen. Standardised pelvis dissections were then performed. Distances between the same key points and the three anatomical references forming a coordinate system were measured on MRIs and dissections. Concordance (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient) between MRI and dissection was calculated. RESULTS: MRI acquisition allowed an adequate visualization of the autonomous innervation. Comparison between 3D MRI images and dissection showed concordant pictures. The statistical analysis showed a mean difference of less than 1 cm between MRI and dissection measures and a correct concordance correlation coefficient on at least two coordinates for each point. CONCLUSION: Our acquisition and post-processing method demonstrated that MRI is suitable for detection of autonomous pelvic innervations and can offer a preoperative nerve cartography. KEY POINTS: • Nerve preservation is a hot topic in pelvic surgery • High resolution MRI can show distal peripheral nerves • Anatomo-radiological comparison shows good correlation between MRI and dissection • 3D reconstructions of pelvic innervation were obtained with an original method • This is a first step towards image-guided pelvic surgery.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can provide structural information and  objective values for nerves. The aims of this study were to perform quantitative evaluation and fibre tracking of the normal inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) using DTI on 3.0-T MRI. METHODS: DTI was applied to 92 IANs of 46 healthy volunteers. Circular regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on three different positions at the mandibular foramen, second molar and mental foramen of each nerve on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and the ADC and FA of each ROI were measured. Differences in the values arising from the nerve positions were evaluated. Furthermore, fibre tracking of the IANs was performed by tractography, and the quality of visualization was evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the ADC and FA between the right and left sides regardless of the anteroposterior positions. Regarding differences arising from the anteroposterior measurement positions, the ADC and FA showed no significant differences (p > 0.017), except for the ADCs between the positions at the mandibular foramen and mental foramen in the left side (p = 0.0068). Overall, 70 (76%) of the 92 IANs could be visualized fully or partially by tractography. CONCLUSIONS: The ADC and FA of the IAN were successfully obtained from healthy volunteers using DTI and were confirmed to be symmetrical regardless of the measurement positions. DTI is a feasible technique for the quantitative evaluation and visualization of the IAN.

N2  - Peripheral nerve conduits were fabricated from biodegradable polyurethane (PU) which  was synthesized by a waterborne process. The biodegradable PU was based on poly(ε-caprolactone) diol and polyethylene butylene adipate diol (2:3 molar ratio) as the soft segment. Conduits formed by the freeze-drying process had asymmetric microporous structure. The PU nerve conduits were used to bridge a 10-mm gap in rat sciatic nerve. Nerve regeneration was evaluated by walking track analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrophysiological, and histological analyses. Results demonstrated that after 6 weeks, walking function was recovered by 40%. MR images showed that the transected nerve was reconnected after 3 weeks and the diameter of the regenerated nerve increased from 3 to 6 weeks. The nerve conduction velocity of the regenerated nerve reached 50% of the normal value after 6 weeks. Histological examination revealed that the cross-sectional area of the regenerated nerve at the midconduit was 0.24 mm(2) after 6 weeks. The efficacy of PU nerve conduits based on functional recovery and histology was superior to that of commercial conduits (Neurotube). The PU nerve conduit developed in this study may be a potential candidate for clinical peripheral nerve tissue engineering. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Functional assessments of the heart by dynamic cardiovascular magnetic  resonance (CMR) commonly rely on (i) electrocardiographic (ECG) gating yielding pseudo real-time cine representations, (ii) balanced gradient-echo sequences referred to as steady-state free precession (SSFP), and (iii) breath holding or respiratory gating. Problems may therefore be due to the need for a robust ECG signal, the occurrence of arrhythmia and beat to beat variations, technical instabilities (e.g., SSFP "banding" artefacts), and limited patient compliance and comfort. Here we describe a new approach providing true real-time CMR with image acquisition times as short as 20 to 30 ms or rates of 30 to 50 frames per second. METHODS: The approach relies on a previously developed real-time MR method, which combines a strongly undersampled radial FLASH CMR sequence with image reconstruction by regularized nonlinear inversion. While iterative reconstructions are currently performed offline due to limited computer speed, online monitoring during scanning is accomplished using gridding reconstructions with a sliding window at the same frame rate but with lower image quality. RESULTS: Scans of healthy young subjects were performed at 3 T without ECG gating and during free breathing. The resulting images yield T1 contrast (depending on flip angle) with an opposed-phase or in-phase condition for water and fat signals (depending on echo time). They completely avoid (i) susceptibility-induced artefacts due to the very short echo times, (ii) radiofrequency power limitations due to excitations with flip angles of 10 degrees or less, and (iii) the risk of peripheral nerve stimulation due to the use of normal gradient switching modes. For a section thickness of 8 mm, real-time images offer a spatial resolution and total acquisition time of 1.5 mm at 30 ms and 2.0 mm at 22 ms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Though awaiting thorough clinical evaluation, this work describes a robust and flexible acquisition and reconstruction technique for real-time CMR at the ultimate limit of this technology.

N2  - OBJECT: Extraspinal sciatica can present unique challenges in clinical diagnosis and  management. In this study, the authors evaluated qualitative and quantitative patterns of sciatica-related pathology at the ischial tuberosity on MR neurography (MRN) studies performed for chronic extraspinal sciatica. METHODS: Lumbosacral MRN studies obtained in 14 patients at the University of California, San Francisco between 2007 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients had been referred by neurosurgeons or neurologists for chronic unilateral sciatica (≥ 3 months), and the MRN reports described asymmetrical increased T2 signal within the sciatic nerve at the level of the ischial tuberosity. MRN studies were also performed prospectively in 6 healthy volunteers. Sciatic nerve T2 signal intensity (SI) and cross-sectional area at the ischial tuberosity were calculated and compared between the 2 sides in all 20 subjects. The same measurements were also performed at the sciatic notch as an internal reference. Adjacent musculoskeletal pathology was compared between the 2 sides in all subjects. RESULTS: Seven of the 9 patients for whom detailed histories were available had a specific history of injury or trauma near the proximal hamstring preceding the onset of sciatica. Eight of the 14 patients also demonstrated soft-tissue abnormalities adjacent to the proximal hamstring origin. The remaining 6 had normal muscles, tendons, and marrow in the region of the ischial tuberosity. There was a significant difference in sciatic nerve SI and size between the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides at the level of the ischial tuberosity, with a mean adjusted SI of 1.38 compared with 1.00 (p < 0.001) and a mean cross-sectional nerve area of 0.66 versus 0.54 cm(2) (p = 0.002). The control group demonstrated symmetrical adjusted SI and sciatic nerve size. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that chronic sciatic neuropathy can be seen at the ischial tuberosity in the setting of prior proximal hamstring tendon injury or adjacent soft-tissue abnormalities. Because hamstring tendon injury as a cause of chronic sciatica remains a diagnosis of exclusion, this distinct category of patients has not been described in the radiographic literature and merits special attention from clinicians and radiologists in the management of extraspinal sciatica. Magnetic resonance neurography is useful for evaluating chronic sciatic neuropathy both qualitatively and quantitatively, particularly in patients for whom electromyography and traditional MRI studies are unrevealing.

N2  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A double-crush lesion is a condition in which the lumbar nerve  is compressed both medially and laterally in the spinal canal, where diagnosis can be very difficult, and is a factor leading to poor surgical success rates. PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to determine DTI parameter fractional anisotropy (FA) values and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in both intraspinal column lesions alone and in double-crush lesions. STUDY DESIGN: This study used a prospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Of the 56 cases (mean age: 72.2 years) that underwent laminectomy for lumbar spinal stenosis at our clinic between April 2013 to March, 2015, 10 cases with L5 radiculopathy caused by L4-L5 stenosis (Intraspinal stenosis group (Group I); mean age: 74.7 years), and 5 cases with persistent symptoms caused by L5 foraminal stenosis despite L4-L5 decompression surgery (Double-crush group (Group D); mean age: 77.6 years) were targeted. One patient in Group D was diagnosed through microendoscopic intrapedicular partial pediculotomy and the remaining four cases by nerve root infiltration. Five healthy cases (mean age: 54 years) were studied as controls. OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraspinal zone (Iz), nerve root (N), and extraforaminal zone (Ez) were established as the regions of interest, and the L5 nerve FA and ADC values were determined on the affected side. METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging was performed prospectively by 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging before surgery, and DTI parameters of L5 nerve were evaluated in all patients and healthy volunteers. Student t test was used for group comparisons, and a p<.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy values (Iz, N, Ez) were 0.415, 0.448, and 0.517, respectively, increasing as sites became more distal. Group I values were 0.335, 0.393, and 0.484, and Group D values were 0.296, 0.367, and 0.360. Compared with the healthy volunteers, Group D had significantly lower Iz (p<.05) and Ez (p<.001) values, while Group I had significantly lower Iz (p<.05) values. In Group D, Ez FA values were significantly lower (p<.001) than in Group I. Apparent diffusion coefficient values (Iz, N, Ez) in the healthy control group were 1.270 mm2/s, 1.151 mm2/s, and 0.937 mm2/s with values decreasing as sites grew distal. In Group I, the ADC values were 1.406 mm2/s, 1.184 mm2/s, and 1.001 mm2/s, while in Group D they were 1.551 mm2/s, 1.412 mm2/s, and 1.329 mm2/s. Compared with the healthy volunteers, Iz (p<.05) and Ez (p<.05) values were significantly higher in Group D. The N (p<.01) and Ez (p<.001) ADC values were significantly higher in Group D than in Group I. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on where the nerve was compressed, changes in DTI parameters revealed nerve damage (low FA values and increased ADC) in the intraspinal canal in the Intraspinal Group, and over a widespread area in the Double-crush Group spanning the medial to lateral spinal canal. Our research suggests that in cases where double crush is suspected before surgery, failed back surgery syndrome may be prevented by evaluating DTI images.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of lumbar  nerves with reduced field of view (rFOV) using 3 T MRI. METHODS: DTI measured with rFOV was compared with conventional FOV (cFOV) 3.0 T MRI in 5 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with degenerative lumbar disorders. The intracanal, foramina and extraforamina of the L5 nerve were established as the regions of interest and fractional anisotropy (FA) values and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured. Image quality for tractography and FA maps and ADC maps, interindividual and intraindividual reliability of FA and ADC, and signal-to-noise (SNR) were studied. RESULTS: Both of image qualities with tractography, FA map and ADC map showed that lumbar nerves were more clearly imaged with the rFOV. Intraindividual reliability was higher with rFOV compared with the conventional method for ADC values, while interindividual reliability was higher for both FA values and ADC values with the rFOV method over the conventional method (p < 0.05). Significantly higher SNR was obtained with rFOV compared with cFOV in the spinal canal (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: rFOV enabled clearer imaging of the lumbar nerve, allowing for more accurate measurement of FA and ADC values. Significantly higher SNR was obtained with rFOV compared with cFOV in the spinal canal. To our knowledge, this research showed for the first time the usefulness of rFOV in patients with degenerative lumbar disorders. High resolution DTI using rFOV may become useful in clinical applications because visualization of nerve entrapments and quantification of DTI parameters may allow more accurate diagnoses of lumbar nerve dysfunction. Advances in knowledge: Compared with traditional methods, rFOV allows for clear imaging of the lumbar nerve and enables accurate measurements of the FA and ADC values. High-resolution DTI with rFOV may be used to visualize nerve entrapments and allow for more accurate diagnosis of DTI parameter quantification with opportunities for clinical applications.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: This diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) study aimed to  clarify the relationship of peripheral nerves and soft tissue tumors (STTs) in 3D to optimize subsequent treatment. METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive STT patients (histologically malignant, n=10; intermediate, n=3; and benign, n=13) underwent 3-Tesla MRI using an echoplanar DTI sequence. Deterministic tractography was performed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured within peritumoral and distant regions of interest. RESULTS: Tractography depicted the 3D course of the sciatic (n=12), femoral (n=2), tibial (n=7), fibular (n=2), median (n=1), musculocutaneous (n=1), and ulnar (n=1) nerves in a regular (n=8 of 18, 44.4%) or thinned (n=7 of 18, 38.9%) fashion. The lowest peritumoral FA values, abrupt thinning, and/or complete discontinuity of trajectories were found in 2 cases with histologically proven tumoral nerve infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: DTI clarifies the 3D topography between major peripheral nerves and STTs and may be helpful in the assessment of peripheral nerve infiltration by malignant tumors.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Abnormalities of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LABCN) are  associated with antecubital elbow conditions, such as distal biceps brachii tendon tears and traumatic cephalic vein phlebotomy. These can lead to lateral forearm, elbow, and wrist symptoms that can mimic other disease processes. The purpose of this study was to characterize the sonographic appearance of the LABCN using cadaveric dissection and retrospective analysis of sonographic examinations of symptomatic patients with magnetic resonance imaging correlation. METHODS: For the first part of this study, a cadaveric elbow specimen was examined, and sonography was performed after dissection to identify the LABCN. Subsequently, 26 elbows in 13 patients with LABCN abnormalities were identified with sonography and retrospectively evaluated to characterize the appearance of the LABCN in both symptomatic and asymptomatic elbows. RESULTS: The symptomatic LABCNs showed fusiform enlargement, increased echogenicity, and loss of the normal fascicular echo texture. The mean cross-sectional area of the symptomatic nerves was 12.0 mm(2) (range, 6.1-17.2 mm(2)), with a maximum thickness of 3.5 mm (range, 2.3-5.9 mm), compared to 3.3 mm(2) (range, 1.9-5.2 mm(2)), with a maximum thickness of 1.3 mm (range, 0.9-2.2 mm), in the contralateral normal elbows. CONCLUSIONS: The close proximity of the LABCN to the distal biceps tendon and the cephalic vein makes it vulnerable to compression and injury in the setting of distal biceps tendon tears and traumatic phlebotomy, which may cause nerve enlargement and increased echogenicity. Awareness of the location and appearance of the LABCN on sonography is important for determining potential causes of lateral elbow and forearm pain.

N2  - To investigate the microstructural changes in compressed nerves using diffusion  tensor imaging (DTI) of herniated disc treated with percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy.Diffusion tensor imaging has been widely used to visualize peripheral nerves, and the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed using DTI. However, the microstructural changes after surgery are not well-understood in patients with lumbar disc herniation.Thirty-four consecutive patients with foraminal disc herniation affecting unilateral sacral 1 (S1) nerve roots were enrolled in this study. DTI with tractography was performed on S1 nerve roots before and after surgery. The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient values were calculated from tractography images.In compressed nerve roots, the FA value before surgery was significantly lower than that after surgery (P = 0.000). A significant difference in FA values was found between the compressed and normal sides before surgery (P = 0.000). However, no significant difference was found between the compressed and normal sides after surgery (P = 0.057). A significant difference in apparent diffusion coefficient values was found before and after surgery at the compressed side (P = 0.023). However, no significant difference was found between the compressed and normal sides after surgery (P = 0.203).We show that the diffusion parameters of compressed nerve roots were not significantly different before and after percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy, indicating that the microstructure of the nerve root recovered after surgery.

N2  - SPG11 mutations are the major cause of autosomal recessive Hereditary Spastic  Paraplegia. The disease has a wide phenotypic variability indicating many regions of the nervous system besides the corticospinal tract are affected. Despite this, anatomical and phenotypic characterization is restricted. In the present study, we investigate the anatomical abnormalities related to SPG11 mutations and how they relate to clinical and cognitive measures. Moreover, we aim to depict how the disease course influences the regions affected, unraveling different susceptibility of specific neuronal populations. We performed clinical and paraclinical studies encompassing neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological tools in a cohort of twenty-five patients and age matched controls. We assessed cortical thickness (FreeSurfer software), deep grey matter volumes (T1-MultiAtlas tool), white matter microstructural damage (DTI-MultiAtlas) and spinal cord morphometry (Spineseg software) on a 3 T MRI scan. Mean age and disease duration were 29 and 13.2 years respectively. Sixty-four percent of the patients were wheelchair bound while 84% were demented. We were able to unfold a diffuse pattern of white matter integrity loss as well as basal ganglia and spinal cord atrophy. Such findings contrasted with a restricted pattern of cortical thinning (motor, limbic and parietal cortices). Electromyography revealed motor neuronopathy affecting 96% of the probands. Correlations with disease duration pointed towards a progressive degeneration of multiple grey matter structures and spinal cord, but not of the white matter. SPG11-related hereditary spastic paraplegia is characterized by selective neuronal vulnerability, in which a precocious and widespread white matter involvement is later followed by a restricted but clearly progressive grey matter degeneration.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used in the study of the central nervous  system. DTI represents a potential diagnostic tool for the peripheral nerve. However, more detailed information is needed for application of DTI in the clinical setting. In this study, peripheral degeneration and regeneration were evaluated using DTI-based analyses in a rabbit model. The changes in DTI parameters were compared to histological and functional changes after nerve injury. We used a high magnetic field (7.04T) MRI system. Japanese white male rabbits were used as the model of sciatic nerve crush injury. MR images were obtained before injury and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks post-injury. The DTI parameters of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (λ||), and radial diffusivity (λ⊥) were calculated. Our results showed decreased FA and increased λ⊥ during the degenerative phase after sciatic nerve injury. In contrast, increased FA and decreased λ⊥ were observed during the regenerative phase. FA changes were correlated with axon number and with motor function recovery, assessed with the toe-spreading index. This study clearly demonstrates the validity of applying DTI parameters to the in vivo evaluation of peripheral nerve regeneration. Furthermore, results suggest that DTI can be a potent tool for predicting the extent of functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We imaged the corticospinal tract (CST) and corticoreticular pathway  (CRP) using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) to evaluate the cause of muscle weakness in a patient who was exposed to high-voltage electricity. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old man presented with quadriparesis after high-voltage electrical shock from power lines while working about 5.8 years ago. The electrical current entered through the left hand and exited through the occipital area of the head. The degree of weakness on bilateral upper and lower extremities was 3-4 on the Medical Research Council strength scale. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed 5.8 years after onset. The CST and CRP were depicted by placing two regions of interest for each neural tract on the two-dimensional fractional anisotropy color map. DTT of the DTI scan showed that the bilateral CST and CRP were thinned compared to those of the healthy control subject. On the nerve conduction test, abnormal findings suggesting peripheral nerve lesion were not observed. Therefore, injury of bilateral CST and CRP seems to have contributed to our patient's weakness after the electrical shock. CONCLUSION: Depiction of neural tracts in the brain using DTT can assist in the accurate and detailed evaluation of the cause of neural deficit after electrical injury.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The expected MRI-based dimensions of the intracranial optic nerve and  optic tract in neonates are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sizes of the intracranial optic nerve and optic tract in neonates at term-equivalent age using MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed brain MRI examinations in 62 infants (28 boys) without intracranial abnormalities. The images were obtained in infants at term-equivalent age with a 1.5-tesla MRI scanner. We measured the widths and heights of the intracranial optic nerve and optic tract and calculated the cross-sectional areas using the formula for an ellipse. RESULTS: The means ± standard deviation of the width, height and cross-sectional area of the intracranial optic nerve were 2.7 ± 0.2 mm, 1.7 ± 0.2 mm and 3.5 ± 0.5 mm(2), respectively. The width, height and cross-sectional area of the optic tract were 1.5 ± 0.1 mm, 1.6 ± 0.1 mm and 2.0 ± 0.2 mm(2), respectively. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we found that postmenstrual age showed independent intermediate positive correlations with the width (r = 0.48, P < 0.01) and cross-sectional area (r = 0.40, P < 0.01) of the intracranial optic nerve. The lower bounds of the 95% prediction intervals for the width and cross-sectional area of the intracranial optic nerve were 0.07 × (postmenstrual age in weeks) - 0.46 mm, and 0.17 × (postmenstrual age in weeks) - 4.0 mm(2), respectively. CONCLUSION: We identified the sizes of the intracranial optic nerve and optic tract in neonates at term-equivalent age. The postmenstrual age at MRI independently positively correlated with the sizes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The management of peripheral nerve injuries remains a large challenge  for plastic surgeons. With the inability to fuse axonal endings, results after microsurgical nerve repair have been inconsistent. Our current nerve repair strategies rely upon the slow and lengthy process of axonal regeneration (~1 mm/d). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been investigated as a potential axonal fusion agent; however, the percentage of axonal fusion has been inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to identify a PEG delivery device to standardize outcomes after attempted axonal fusion with PEG. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a rat sciatic nerve injury model in which we completely transected and repaired the left sciatic nerve to evaluate the efficacy of PEG fusion over a span of 12 weeks. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of a delivery device's ability to optimize results after PEG fusion. RESULTS: We found that PEG rapidly (within minutes) restores axonal continuity as assessed by electrophysiology, fluorescent retrograde tracer, and diffusion tensor imaging. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that motor axon counts are significantly increased at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks postoperatively in PEG-treated animals. Furthermore, PEG restored behavioral functions up to 50% compared with animals that received the criterion standard epineurial repair (control animals). CONCLUSIONS: The ability of PEG to rapidly restore nerve function after neurotmesis could have vast implications on the clinical management of traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)  has shown that fractional anisotropy (FA) is lower in peripheral nerves in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We examined whether DTI correlates to muscle strength or impairment. METHODS: MRI of sciatic and tibial nerves was performed on 3-T MR scanner by obtaining T2- and DTI-weighted sequences with fat saturation. On each slice of T2-weighted (T2w) and DTI, the tibial and sciatic nerves were segmented and served for calculation of signal intensity. On DTI images, pixel-by-pixel calculation of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was done. Muscle strength at knee and ankle was determined by isokinetic dynamometry and severity of CIDP by neuropathy impairment score (NIS). RESULTS: Fourteen CIDP patients treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin were compared to gender- and age-matched controls. T2w values expressed as a nerve/muscle ratio (nT2w) were unchanged in CIDP versus controls 0.93 ± 0.21 versus 1.02 ± 0.21 (P = 0.10). FA values were lower in CIDP compared to controls 0.38 ± 0.07 versus 0.45 ± 0.05 (P < 0.0001), and ADC values were higher in CIDP versus controls 1735 ± 232 versus 1593 ± 116 × 10(-6) mm(2)/s (P = 0.005). In CIDP, FA values correlated to clinical impairment (NIS) (r = -0.57, P = 0.03), but not to muscle strength. FA value in the sciatic nerve distinguishes CIDP from controls with a sensitivity and a specificity of 92.9 %. CONCLUSION: CIDP patients have unchanged nT2w values, lower FA values, and higher ADC values of sciatic and tibial nerves compared to controls. FA values correlated to NIS but were unrelated to muscle strength. DTI of sciatic nerves seems promising to differentiate CIDP from controls.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the sciatic nerves of patients with unilateral sciatica by  using an ultrasound, and to determine whether ultrasonographic findings were related to clinical and electrophysiologic parameters. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Physical medicine and rehabilitation departments of a university hospital and a rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients (N=30; 10 men, 20 women) with complaints of low back pain and unilateral sciatica of more than 1 month of duration were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients underwent a substantial clinical assessment, and they were also evaluated by electromyogram and magnetic resonance imaging. Pain was evaluated by a visual analog scale and the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) Scale. A linear array probe (7.5-12MHz) was used to scan sciatic nerves bilaterally in the prone position. Sciatic nerve diameters-thickness (short axis) and width (long axis)-and cross-sectional areas were measured bilaterally at the same levels, proximal to the bifurcation and midthigh. The values pertaining to the unaffected limbs were taken as controls. RESULTS: When compared with the unaffected sides, mean values for sciatic nerve measurements-long axis at bifurcation level (P=.017) and cross-sectional area at midthigh level (P=.005)-were significantly larger on the affected sides. Swelling ratios negatively correlated with symptom duration (r=-.394, P=.038) and LANSS scores (r=-.451, P=.016) at only midthigh level. CONCLUSIONS: Sciatic nerves seem to be enlarged on the side of sciatica in patients with low back pain. Our preliminary results may provide insight into better understanding the lower limb radiating pain in this group of patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients with cervical compression myelopathy (CCM) generally present  bilateral neurological symptoms in their extremities. However, a substantial portion of patients with CCM exhibit laterality of neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between intrinsic structural damage and laterality of symptoms using spinal cord diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the corticospinal tract. METHODS: We enrolled 10 healthy volunteers and 40 patients with CCM in this study. We evaluated motor function using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score for left and right extremities. For DTI acquisitions, a 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging system with diffusion-weighted spin-echo sequence was used. Regions-of-interest in the lateral column tracts were determined. We determined the correlations between fractional anisotropy (FA) and ASIA motor scores. An FA asymmetry index was calculated using left and right regions-of-interest. RESULTS: Four patients exhibited laterality of symptoms in their extremities, for which left and right ASIA scores correlated moderately with FA in the left and right lateral columns, respectively (left: ρ = 0.64, P < 0.001; right: ρ = 0.67, P < 0.001). The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve showed that the FA asymmetry index indicated laterality of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Using tract-specific DTI, we demonstrated that microstructural damages in the left and right corticospinal tracts correlated with corresponding neurological symptoms in the ipsilateral side and the FA asymmetry index could indicate laterality in neurological symptoms of patients with CCM.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of surgery on the optic pathway of patients with  intra- or parasellar mass lesions, as evidenced by readout-segmented DTI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with intra- or parasellar mass lesions were included in the study. Readout-segmented DTI and T2WI were obtained before and after surgery. The ROIs were set on the optic chiasm as well as the anterior and posterior optic tracts. For each ROI, axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), fractional anisotropy (FA), and ADC values were calculated. DTI parameters in preoperative studies of all patients were compared and related to the presence of tumor compression. In patients who underwent surgery, pre- and postoperative DTI parameters were compared. The correlation between DTI parameters and visual function was determined. RESULTS: In the preoperative studies, the optic chiasm of patients with tumor compression showed significant lower AD and RD values. The optic chiasm of patients with visual field disorder showed significantly lower AD and RD values compared to patients without the disorder. There was a negative correlation with a trend toward significance between FA values and visual field disorder scores. The comparative analysis of patients in pre- and postoperative studies showed that the optic chiasm of patients with tumor compression presented a significant lower FA (0.41 versus 0.30, p=0.0068) and higher RD values after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: DTI is a useful tool to assess the impact of surgery on the optic chiasm and nerve.

N2  - Paresthesia-dominant and pain-dominant subgroups have been noted in carpal tunnel  syndrome (CTS), a peripheral neuropathic disorder characterized by altered primary somatosensory/motor (S1/M1) physiology. We aimed to investigate whether brain morphometry dissociates these subgroups. Subjects with CTS were evaluated with nerve conduction studies, whereas symptom severity ratings were used to allocate subjects into paresthesia-dominant (CTS-paresthesia), pain-dominant (CTS-pain), and pain/paresthesia nondominant (not included in further analysis) subgroups. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at 3T using a multiecho MPRAGE T1-weighted pulse sequence, and gray matter cortical thickness was calculated across the entire brain using validated, automated methods. CTS-paresthesia subjects demonstrated reduced median sensory nerve conduction velocity (P = 0.05) compared with CTS-pain subjects. In addition, cortical thickness in precentral and postcentral gyri (S1/M1 hand area) contralateral to the more affected hand was significantly reduced in CTS-paresthesia subgroup compared with CTS-pain subgroup. Moreover, in CTS-paresthesia subjects, precentral cortical thickness was negatively correlated with paresthesia severity (r(34) = -0.40, P = 0.016) and positively correlated with median nerve sensory velocity (r(36) = 0.51, P = 0.001), but not with pain severity. Conversely, in CTS-pain subjects, contralesional S1 (r(9) = 0.62, P = 0.042) and M1 (r(9) = 0.61, P = 0.046) cortical thickness were correlated with pain severity, but not median nerve velocity or paresthesia severity. This double dissociation in somatotopically specific S1/M1 areas suggests a neuroanatomical substrate for symptom-based CTS subgroups. Such fine-grained subgrouping of CTS may lead to improved personalized therapeutic approaches, based on superior characterization of the linkage between peripheral and central neuroplasticity.

N2  - Successful management of peripheral nerve trauma relies on accurate localization of  the injury and grading of the severity of nerve injury to determine whether surgical intervention is required. Existing techniques, such as electrodiagnostic studies and conventional imaging modalities, provide important information, but are limited by being unable to distinguish severe nerve lesions in continuity that will recover from those that will not. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of peripheral nerves provide a novel technique to localize and grade nerve injury, by assessing the integrity of the nerve fibers across the site of nerve injury. Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography also hold promise as markers of early nerve regeneration, prior to clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of recovery. In the present review, the techniques of peripheral nerve DTI and tractography are discussed with respect to peripheral nerve trauma, with illustrative cases demonstrating potential roles of these novel approaches.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and  morphological analysis of peripheral nerve tumours (PNTs). In recent years, a number of novel MRI sequences such as MR neurography (MRN), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or MR tractography (MRT) have emerged extending the range of conventional MRI techniques. These advanced sequences are able to provide detailed information concerning PNTs structure, including the course and function of individual neural fascicles. This data can then be utilized in tailoring a suitable surgical procedure, reducing the risks of postoperative neurological deficit. The following case report of a median nerve tumour demonstrates the range and practicality of current MRI techniques. With continuing advancement and perfection of these MRI techniques, we can expect their integration into standard diagnostic protocols of PNTs.

N2  - The in vivo assessment of axonal projections of the peripheral nervous system has  been severely limited by the lack of noninvasive techniques. We examined whether MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking of the human median nerve is feasible. The median nerve was examined with a 3-T MRI scanner in wrists of three healthy volunteers and the wrist of a patient after median nerve repair. In vivo three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of axonal projections of the median nerve could be achieved in healthy volunteers with intact median nerves and a patient with a transected median nerve using diffusion tensor imaging combined with fiber tracking. The median nerve could be visualized and correlated well to the expected location on T1-weighted images in the patient and all volunteers. The transected median nerve in the patient could be detected up to the site of repair one month postoperatively, whereas the nerve could not be detected more distally immediately after repair. Two months postoperatively, it could clearly be tracked more distally, indicating nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging can detect the median nerve in healthy individuals as well as up to the lesion site in a patient with a complete transection of the median nerve.

N2  - BACKGROUND The optic radiation (OR) is a white-matter bundle connecting the lateral  geniculate body and the visual cortex. Phase difference-enhanced imaging (PADRE) is a new MRI technique that is able to achieve precise delineation of the OR. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of age on the volume and signal intensity of the OR using PADRE, and to establish a volumetric reference of the OR from a healthy population, compared with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-nine healthy volunteers underwent MR imaging with PADRE and DTI sequences on a 3.0-T scanner. For the volumetric analysis with PADRE, the OR corresponding to the external sagittal stratum was manually traced, while an automated thresholding method was used for the DTI-based volumetric analysis of the OR. RESULTS The mean right and left OR volumes measured from the PADRE images were 1469.0±242.4 mm³ and 1372.6±310.2 mm³, respectively. Although OR volume showed no significant correlation with age, the normalized OR signal intensity showed a linear correlation with increasing age (r²=0.50-0.53; P<0.01). The OR signal intensity on PADRE and DTI-related quantitative parameters for the OR showed significant correlations (r²=0.46-0.49; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS The PADRE technique revealed exceptional preservation of OR volume, even in later life. Moreover, PADRE was able to detect age-related changes in signal intensity of the OR and may contribute to future analyses of pathological neurodegeneration in patients with glaucoma and multiple sclerosis.

N2  - Globoid cell leukodystrophy is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a  deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase. In both human patients and the authentic murine Twitcher model, pathological findings include demyelination as well as axonal damage in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has emerged as a powerful noninvasive technique that is sensitive to these white matter disease processes. Increases in radial diffusivity (lambda perpendicular) and decreases in axial diffusivity (lambda parallel) correlate with histopathological evidence of demyelination and axonal damage, respectively. Compared to age-matched, normal littermates, DTI of optic nerve and trigeminal nerve in end-stage Twitcher mice displayed a statistically significant increase in lambda perpendicular and decrease in lambda parallel, consistent with previously characterized demyelination and axonal damage in these regions. In the Twitcher spinal cord, a statistically significant decrease in lambda parallel was identified in both the dorsal and ventrolateral white matter, relative to normal controls. These results were consistent with immunofluorescence evidence of axonal damage in these areas as detected by staining for nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI32). Increase in lambda perpendicular in Twitcher spinal cord white matter relative to normal controls reached statistical significance in the dorsal columns and approached statistical significance in the ventrolateral region. Correlative reduced levels of myelin basic protein were detected by immunofluorescent staining in both these white matter regions in the Twitcher spinal cord. Fractional anisotropy, a nonspecific but sensitive indicator of white matter disease, was significantly reduced in the optic nerve, trigeminal nerve, and throughout the spinal cord white matter of Twitcher mice, relative to normal controls. This first reported application of spinal cord DTI in the setting of GLD holds potential as a noninvasive, quantitative assay of therapeutic efficacy in future treatment studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nerve root compression by lumbar disc herniation (LDH)  induces a series of clinical symptoms, seriously affecting the patient's life and work. The purpose of this study is to investigate microstructural changes and fiber bundle abnormalities of the compressed L5 and S1 nerve roots in young patients with unilateral LDH by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Forty young patients with unilateral LDH and 17 healthy volunteers participated in the study, and 33 patients received follow-up DTI examination after one month of conservative treatment. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and trace weight (TraceW) values of the L5 and S1 nerve roots were measured on FA maps. RESULTS: The mean FA, ADC and TraceW values of the affected nerve roots were 0.259 ± 0.047, 1.79 ± 0.252 and 0.076 ± 0.025, respectively. Compared to the contralateral side and volunteers, the affected nerve roots showed a decreased FA (P < 0.01), an increased ADC (P < 0.01) and TraceW (P < 0.05). The compression severity had a moderately negative correlation with FA (r = -0.646, P < 0.01) and positive correlation with ADC (r = 0.408, P < 0.01) but not with TraceW (r = 0.298, P = 0.06). For 33 patients with follow-up study after conservative treatment, FA (0.286 ± 0.06) and ADC (1.630 ± 0.046) in the affected nerve roots showed an increasing and a decreasing trend, respectively. Moreover, FA values (14 cases; 0.246 ± 0.015, P = 0.213) in the severe compression group had no significant changes between initial and follow-up data. CONCLUSIONS: DTI is able to assess microstructural abnormalities of the compressed nerve roots and has potentially practical value for prognostic evaluation after treatment in patients with LDH.

N2  - PURPOSE: To quantitatively analyze the optic nerve alterations in chronic Leber's  hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) using reduced field-of-view diffusion tensor imaging (rFOV-DTI) and evaluate the correlation of diffusion parameters with visual functional and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. METHODS: Twenty-five patients (50 affected optic nerves) with chronic LHON and 28 healthy controls (56 normal optic nerves) were enrolled. The rFOV-DTI was performed in the bilateral optic nerves for all the subjects. The fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), principal eigenvalue (λ//), and orthogonal eigenvalue (λ⊥) were calculated for quantitative analysis. Visual field (VF) and visual acuity (VA) were measured in all subjects. The peripapillary RNFL thickness was assessed using optical coherence tomography (OCT). The correlation of DTI diffusion parameters with visual function and peripapillary RNFL thickness was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with optic nerves in the control group, the mean FA was significant decreased (P<0.005), and the mean MD, λ//and λ⊥ significant increased (P<0.005). The average and temporal peripapillary RNFL thickness were significantly thinned in LHON patients. There was a significant correlation between optic nerve FA and VA, mean deviation of visual field (MD(VF)) (P<0.005). Also, optic nerve FA correlated significantly with average RNFL thickness (P<0.05) but not with MD, λ//and λ⊥ (P>0.05). However, none of the DTI parameters correlated with age and disease duration (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated that rFOV-DTI could provide information of optic nerve damage in chronic LHON, and can serve as technique for detecting and evaluating pathological changes in the optic nerve in LHON.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Numerous classification systems have been proposed to interpret lumbar  MRI scans. The clinical impact of the measured parameters remains unclear. To evaluate the clinical significance of imaging results in patients with multisegmental degenerative pathologies, treating specialists can perform image-guided local injections to target defined areas such as the epidural space. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the correlation between lumbar spinal stenosis measurements obtained by MRI and improvement obtained through local epidural injection. METHODS: In this retrospective study various measurement and classification systems for lumbar spinal stenosis were applied to MRI scans of 100 patients with this pathological condition. The reported effect of epidural bupivacaine/triamcinolone injections at the site was recorded in these patients and a comparative analysis performed. RESULTS: MRI features assessed in this study did not show any relevant correlation with reported pain relief after epidural injection in patients with chronic lumbar stenosis, with the exception of posterior disc height with a weak Kendall's tau of -0.187 (p= 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Although MRI is crucial for evaluating lumbar spinal stenosis, it cannot replace but is rather complementary to a good patient history and clinical examination or the results of local diagnostic injections.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We compared different surgical techniques for nerve regeneration in a  rabbit sciatic nerve gap model using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), electrophysiology, limb function, and histology. METHODS: A total of 24 male New Zealand white rabbits were randomized into three groups: autograft (n = 8), hollow conduit (n = 8), and collagen-filled conduit (n = 8). A 10-mm segment of the rabbit proximal sciatic nerve was cut, and autograft or collagen conduit was used to bridge the gap. DTI on a 3-T system was performed preoperatively and 13 weeks after surgery using the contralateral, nonoperated nerve as a control. RESULTS: Overall, autograft performed better compared with both conduit groups. Differences in axonal diameter were significant (autograft > hollow conduit > collagen-filled conduit) at 13 weeks (autograft vs. hollow conduit, p = 0.001, and hollow conduit vs. collagen-filled conduit, p < 0.001). Significant group differences were found for axial diffusivity but not for any of the other DTI metrics (autograft > hollow conduit > collagen-filled conduit) (autograft vs. hollow conduit, p = 0.001 and hollow conduit vs. collagen-filled conduit, p = 0.021). As compared with hollow conduit (autograft > collagen-filled conduit > hollow conduit), collagen-filled conduit animals demonstrated a nonsignificant increased maximum tetanic force. CONCLUSIONS: Autograft-treated rabbits demonstrated improved sciatic nerve regeneration compared with collagen-filled and hollow conduits as assessed by histologic, functional, and DTI parameters at 13 weeks.

N2  - OBJECTIVECurrently, there is no treatment that slows or halts the progression of  Parkinson's disease. Delivery of various neurotrophic factors to restore dopaminergic function has become a focus of study in an effort to fill this unmet need for patients with Parkinson's disease. Schwann cells provide a readily available source of such factors. This study presents a 12-month evaluation of safety and feasibility, as well as the clinical response, of implanting autologous peripheral nerve grafts into the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease at the time of deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.METHODSStandard DBS surgery targeting the subthalamic nucleus was performed in 8 study participants. After DBS lead implantation, a section of the sural nerve containing Schwann cells was harvested and unilaterally grafted to the substantia nigra. Adverse events were continually monitored. Baseline clinical data were obtained during standard preoperative evaluations. Clinical outcome data were obtained with postoperative clinical evaluations, neuropsychological testing, and MRI at 1 year after surgery.RESULTSAll 8 participants were implanted with DBS systems and grafts. Adverse event profiles were comparable to those of standard DBS surgery with the exception of 1 superficial infection at the sural nerve harvest site. Three participants also reported numbness in the distribution of the sural nerve distal to the harvest site. Motor scores on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III while the participant was off therapy at 12 months improved from baseline (mean ± SD 25.1 ± 15.9 points at 12 months vs 32.5 ± 9.7 points at baseline). An analysis of the lateralized UPDRS scores also showed a greater overall reduction in scores on the side contralateral to the graft.CONCLUSIONSPeripheral nerve graft delivery to the substantia nigra at the time of DBS surgery is feasible and safe based on the results of this initial pilot study. Clinical outcome data from this phase I trial suggests that grafting may have some clinical benefit and certainly warrants further study to determine if this is an efficacious and neurorestorative therapy.Clinical trial registration no.: NCT01833364 (clinicaltrials.gov).

N2  - PURPOSE: To observe the longitudinal changes of nerve repair in rats after  tissue-engineered construct implantation at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to determine whether the enhanced nerve regeneration with use of tissue-engineered constructs could be monitored with gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging or nerve T2 relaxation time measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All experimental protocols were approved by the institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Tissue-engineered constructs were prepared by seeding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chitosan nerve tubes. Thirty-six rats with sciatic nerve transection injury underwent nerve tube implantation with (n = 18) or without (n = 18) MSC seeding. Sequential T2 measurement, gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging, and sciatic function index measurement were performed over an 8-week follow-up period, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and signal intensity at gadofluorine M-enhanced T1-weighted imaging were measured and were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by the Student-Neuman-Keuls post-hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: Nerve T2 relaxation times and gadofluorine M enhancement, as well as functional changes, showed a similar time course. Nerves implanted with MSC-seeded tubes achieved slightly better functional recovery and enhanced nerve regeneration while showing a slower return to baseline T2 relaxation time and a more rapid decline in gadofluorine M enhancement compared with nerves implanted with chitosan tubes alone. T2 values of the distal portion of transected nerves showed a more rapid return to baseline level than did gadofluorine M enhancement. CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve repair with use of tissue-engineered constructs can be monitored by using gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and T2 relaxation time measurements. T2 relaxation time seems more sensitive than gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging for detecting nerve regeneration.

N2  - "Pure" adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is the noninflammatory myeloneuropathic variant  of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, where the disease process appears to be restricted to spinal cord tracts and peripheral nerves. The absence of obvious brain involvement makes it distinct from the inflammatory cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. However, some pure AMN patients later experience development of cerebral demyelination, but little is known about the extent of brain involvement in pure AMN patients who have normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. We used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate possible occult cerebral abnormalities in such pure AMN patients. Fractional anisotropy and trace were studied in three-dimensional reconstructions of white matter tracts commonly involved in cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Results demonstrated reduced fractional anisotropy and increased trace in bilateral corticospinal tracts and genu of corpus callosum (p < 0.05). Diffusion tensor imaging-based three-dimensional fiber tracking showed occult tract-specific cerebral microstructural abnormalities in pure AMN patients who had a normal conventional brain magnetic resonance image. Corticospinal tract abnormalities could reflect a centripetal extension of spinal cord long-tract distal axonopathy. Accompanying abnormalities in genu of corpus callosum indicate that the disease pathology in pure AMN may not be limited to spinal cord long tracts alone, although the involvement of the latter is most prominent and severe.

N2  - Precise identification of the femoral nerve (FN) is essential for an  ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block. We hypothesized that the distance between the FN and the femoral artery (FA) is correlated with patient age. In this prospective observational study, we evaluated the FN-FA (from the lateral edge of the FA to the medial edge of the FN) distance [0.42 ± 0.42 (mean ± standard deviation) cm] in 102 patients using ultrasound. In addition, we calculated the cross-sectional area of the iliopsoas muscle using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple regression analyses revealed that age was significantly and positively correlated with the FN-FA distance (R(2) = 0.72, p < 0.001) and that this correlation was greater than that between height, weight, or gender and the FN-FA distance. Further, the cross-sectional area of the iliopsoas muscle per weight was significantly correlated with age (R(2) = 0.54, p < 0.001) and the FN-FA distance (R(2) = 0.50, p < 0.001). These findings may help refine the ultrasound techniques used for the femoral nerve block.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely used to visualize peripheral nerves,  but the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed using DTI. However, there are no data regarding the association among microstructural changes evaluated using DTI, the symptoms assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the duration of symptoms after surgery in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Thirty patients with unilateral radiculopathy were investigated using DTI. The changes in the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values as well as the correlation between these changes and the severity and duration of the clinical symptoms were investigated before and at least one month after surgery. The FA values were significantly increased after surgical treatment (p < 0.0001). Both the ADC and ODI values were noticeably decreased (p < 0.0001). A strong positive correlation between the preoperative and postoperative DTI parameters (p < 0.0001) as well as between the preoperative ODI and postoperative ODI/ODI changes (p < 0.0001) were found. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the changes in the DTI parameters and changes in the ODI (p < 0.0001). This preliminary study suggests it may be possible to use DTI to diagnose, quantitatively evaluate and follow-up patients with LDH.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the agreement of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent  diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median nerve on 3.0 T MR scanners from different vendors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IRB approved study including 16 healthy volunteers (9 women; mean age 30.6 ± 5.3 years). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the dominant wrist was performed on three 3.0 T MR scanners (GE, Siemens, Philips) using similar imaging protocols and vendor-proprietary hard- and software. Intra-, inter-reader and inter-vendor agreements were assessed. RESULTS: ICCs for intra-/inter-reader agreements ranged from 0.843-0.970/0.846-0.956 for FA, and 0.840-0.940/0.726-0.929 for ADC, respectively. ANOVA analysis identified significant differences for FA/ADC measurements among vendors (p < 0.001/p < 0.01, respectively). Overall mean values for FA were 0.63 (SD ± 0.1) and 0.999 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s (SD ± 0.134 × 10(-3)) for ADC. A significant negative measurement bias was found for FA values from the GE scanner (-0.05 and -0.07) and for ADC values from the Siemens scanner (-0.053 and -0.063 × 10(-3)mm(2)/s) as compared to the remainder vendors CONCLUSION: FA and ADC values of the median nerve obtained on different 3.0 T MR scanners differ significantly, but are in comparison to the standard deviation of absolute values small enough to not have an impact on larger group studies or when substantial diffusion changes can be expected. However, caution is warranted in an individual patient when interpreting diffusion values from different scanner acquisitions.

N2  - PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in the measurement of  peripheral nerve integrity, although the optimal way to apply the technique for the study of lumbar spinal nerves is unclear. The aims of this study are to use an improved DTI acquisition to investigate lumbar nerve root integrity and correlate this with functional measures using neurophysiology. METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers underwent 3 T DTI of the L5/S1 area. Regions of interest were applied to L5 and S1 nerve roots, and DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity) were derived. Neurophysiological measures were obtained from muscles innervated by L5/S1 nerves; these included the slope of motor-evoked potential input-output curves, F-wave latency, maximal motor response, and central and peripheral motor conduction times. RESULTS: DTI metrics were similar between the left and right sides and between vertebral levels. Conversely, significant differences in DTI measures were seen along the course of the nerves. Regression analyses revealed that DTI metrics of the L5 nerve correlated with neurophysiological measures from the muscle innervated by it. CONCLUSION: The current findings suggest that DTI has the potential to be used for assessing lumbar spinal nerve integrity and that parameters derived from DTI provide quantitative information which reflects their function.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pain information from the face enters the pons via the  trigeminal nerve before creating an anatomical "elbow" that turns caudally into the spinal trigeminal tract (SpTV). Visualization of the descending tract of the trigeminal nerve as it begins its descent from the nerve root entry zone (NREZ) in the pons would improve the accuracy of current procedures aimed at altering or lesioning the trigeminal nerve within the brainstem. The focus of this study was to develop a standardized protocol using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and deterministic tractography methods to image the SpTV. There are currently no standard techniques used to visualize the trigeminal nerve using DTI. METHODS: DTI and tractography were performed on 20 patients: 17 with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), 1 with hemifacial spasm, 1 with a facial nerve tumor, and 1 with an arteriovenous malformation. A standardized protocol was developed using regions of interest (ROIs) located at the SpTV, as determined by a brainstem atlas, and the NREZ. RESULTS: Using our standardized protocol, the descending tract of the trigeminal nerve was successfully visualized in all 20 patients. Trigeminal fibers entered the pons at the NREZ and descended through the SpTV. The accuracy of the visualized tract was confirmed through coregistration with a stereotactic atlas and anatomical scan. CONCLUSION: A successful, robust DTI imaging and postprocessing protocol of the SpTV contributes to our understanding of its anatomical distribution within the brainstem and is a potentially new neurosurgical planning tool.

N2  - We previously reported that neuropathic pain was associated with smaller posterior  cingulate cortical (PCC) volumes, suggesting that a smaller/dysfunctional PCC may contribute to development of pain via impaired mind wandering. A gap in our previous report was lack of evidence for a mechanism for the genesis of PCC atrophy in HIV peripheral neuropathy. Here we investigate if volumetric differences in the subcortex for those with neuropathic paresthesia may contribute to smaller PCC volumes, potentially through deafferentation of ascending white matter tracts resulting from peripheral nerve damage in HIV neuropathy. Since neuropathic pain and paresthesia are highly correlated, statistical decomposition was used to separate pain and paresthesia symptoms to determine which regions of brain atrophy are associated with both pain and paresthesia and which are associated separately with pain or paresthesia. HIV+ individuals (N = 233) with and without paresthesia in a multisite study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry and a segmentation/registration tool were used to investigate regional brain volume changes associated with paresthesia. Analysis of decomposed variables found that smaller midbrain and thalamus volumes were associated with paresthesia rather than pain. However, atrophy in the PCC was related to both pain and paresthesia. Peak thalamic atrophy (p = 0.004; MNI x = - 14, y = - 24, z = - 2) for more severe paresthesia was in a region with reciprocal connections with the PCC. This provides initial evidence that smaller PCC volumes in HIV peripheral neuropathy are related to ascending white matter deafferentation caused by small fiber damage observed in HIV peripheral neuropathy.

N2  - The ability to investigate microstructural properties of the central nervous system  with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown in many studies. More recently, DTI is being applied outside the brain showing promising results, for instance, for investigating muscle tissue. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography to study the nerves of the sacral plexus in humans in vivo and to assess the architectural configuration and microstructural properties of these peripheral nerves. For this research goal we optimized the acquisition parameters of a DTI sequence and acquired data from 10 healthy adults and one 12-year patient having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. For the healthy volunteers, we estimated the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial diffusivities (RD) of the sacral plexus nerves which may serve as a baseline for future studies. We demonstrated that tractography of the sacral plexus on a 3 Tesla MR scanner is feasible, giving 3D insight in the general anatomy and organization of the nerves L4 to S3. In addition, branches to the pudendal nerve were also found in 4 volunteers. There were no significant differences in any of the estimated diffusion measures between the right and left sided nerves or between the nerves L4 to S3 on an intra-subject basis. Furthermore, clinical feasibility of DTI and tractography in a child having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction is demonstrated. The architectural configuration of the child's sacral plexus was comparable with the healthy volunteers and no significant disrupted nerve fibers were observed. However, there are strong indications that abnormal diffusion characteristics are present at the level of the neural tube defect due to incomplete segments of the nerves that are close to the vertebrae. These findings are encouraging for using DTI as a means to investigate changes in microstructural properties of the nerves of the sacral plexus. Moreover, this new methodology may provide a new avenue to a better analysis and diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunctions.

N2  - The majority of previous studies on hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure  palsies (HNPP) were focused on peripheral nerves, whereas cerebral alterations in HNPP have been less attended to. In this work, Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to detect the changes in WM, especially in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in HNPP patients for its sensitivity in probing the microstructure of WM, the sensitive metric was searched for probing cerebral alterations and the regional distribution of cerebral abnormalities was identified. Twelve HNPP patients and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent the conventional MRI, DTI scan, and electrophysiological examination. The conventional MRI images were first analyzed to identify abnormal intense regions and the NAWM regions. NAWM refers to the white matter regions that do not include the lesions on conventional MRI. The apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the NAWM were then measured and compared between patient and control groups. The sensitivity and specificity of 3 methods and the cerebral regional distribution of MR signal abnormalities were further analyzed. Hyperintense foci were observed on T2 weighted image and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images in 6 patients. Compared to the controls, FA values of the patients were significantly lower in bilateral frontal, orbitofrontal, and temporal NAWMs; whereas the electrophysiological examination results of patients and controls exhibited no statistically significant difference. The sensitivity of FA value was higher than that of electrophysiological examination and conventional MRI. The majority of abnormal signals on conventional MRI images and abnormal FA values were located in the frontal and temporal lobes. The results of our study show cerebral WM changes in HNPP patients. FA value in DTI has been shown to be sensitive to the cerebral microstructural changes in HNPP. The frontal lobe is the predilection site that is most involved in HNPP.

N2  - Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic neuropathic facial pain disorder that  commonly responds to surgery. A proportion of patients, however, do not benefit and suffer ongoing pain. There are currently no imaging tools that permit the prediction of treatment response. To address this paucity, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to determine whether pre-surgical trigeminal nerve microstructural diffusivities can prognosticate response to TN treatment. In 31 TN patients and 16 healthy controls, multi-tensor tractography was used to extract DTI-derived metrics-axial (AD), radial (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA)-from the cisternal segment, root entry zone and pontine segment of trigeminal nerves for false discovery rate-corrected Student's t-tests. Ipsilateral diffusivities were bootstrap resampled to visualize group-level diffusivity thresholds of long-term response. To obtain an individual-level statistical classifier of surgical response, we conducted discriminant function analysis (DFA) with the type of surgery chosen alongside ipsilateral measurements and ipsilateral/contralateral ratios of AD and RD from all regions of interest as prediction variables. Abnormal diffusivity in the trigeminal pontine fibers, demonstrated by increased AD, highlighted non-responders (n = 14) compared to controls. Bootstrap resampling revealed three ipsilateral diffusivity thresholds of response-pontine AD, MD, cisternal FA-separating 85% of non-responders from responders. DFA produced an 83.9% (71.0% using leave-one-out-cross-validation) accurate prognosticator of response that successfully identified 12/14 non-responders. Our study demonstrates that pre-surgical DTI metrics can serve as a highly predictive, individualized tool to prognosticate surgical response. We further highlight abnormal pontine segment diffusivities as key features of treatment non-response and confirm the axiom that central pain does not commonly benefit from peripheral treatments.

N2  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a brain body interface which serves to  maintain homeostasis by influencing a plethora of physiological processes, including metabolism, cardiorespiratory regulation and nociception. Accumulating evidence suggests that ANS function is disturbed in numerous prevalent clinical disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. While the brain is a central hub for regulating autonomic function, the association between resting autonomic activity and subcortical morphology has not been comprehensively studied and thus was our aim. In 27 healthy subjects [14 male and 13 female; mean age 30 years (range 22-53 years)], we quantified resting ANS function using validated indices of cardiac sympathetic index (CSI) and parasympathetic cardiac vagal tone (CVT). High resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired, and differences in subcortical nuclei shape, that is, 'deformation', contingent on resting ANS activity were investigated. CSI positively correlated with outward deformation of the brainstem, right nucleus accumbens, right amygdala and bilateral pallidum (all thresholded to corrected P < 0.05). In contrast, parasympathetic CVT negatively correlated with inward deformation of the right amygdala and pallidum (all thresholded to corrected P < 0.05). Left and right putamen volume positively correlated with CVT (r = 0.62, P = 0.0047 and r = 0.59, P = 0.008, respectively), as did the brainstem (r = 0.46, P = 0.049). These data provide novel evidence that resting autonomic state is associated with differences in the shape and volume of subcortical nuclei. Thus, subcortical morphological brain differences in various disorders may partly be attributable to perturbation in autonomic function. Further work is warranted to investigate these findings in clinical populations. Hum Brain Mapp 39:381-392, 2018. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - The majority of nerve fibers in the spinal cord run longitudinally, playing an  important role in connecting the brain to the peripheral nerves. There is a growing interest in applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to the evaluation of spinal cord microarchitecture. The current study sought to compare the organization of longitudinal nerve fibers between healthy and myelopathic spinal cords using entropy-based analysis of principal eigenvector mapping. A total of 22 subjects were recruited, including 14 healthy subjects, seven cervical myelopathy (CM) patients with single-level compression, and one patient suffering from multi-level compression. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (MR) images of the cervical spinal cord were obtained using a pulsed gradient, spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence with a 3T MR system. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually to cover the spinal cord, and Shannon entropy was calculated in principal eigenvector maps. The results revealed no significant differences in orientation entropy values along the whole length of cervical spinal cord in healthy subjects (C2-3: 0.73±0.05; C3-4: 0.71±0.07; C4-5: 0.72±0.048; C5-6: 0.71±0.07; C6-7: 0.72±0.07). In contrast, orientation entropy values in myelopathic cord were significantly higher at the compression site (0.91±0.03), and the adjacent levels (above: 0.85±0.03; below: 0.83±0.05). This study provides a novel approach to analyze the orientation information in diffusion MR images of healthy and diseased spinal cord. These results indicate that orientation entropy can be applied to determine the contribution of each compression level to the overall disorganization of principal nerve tracts of myelopathic spinal cord in cases with multi-level compression.

N2  - PURPOSE: Redundant nerve roots (RNRs) are a negative prognostic factor in patients  with central lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Forty percent of candidates for surgical decompression show RNRs (RNR+) on preoperative conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We investigated the prevalence of RNRs in three functional postures (standing, neutral sitting and flexed sitting) with an upright MRI (upMRI). METHODS: A retrospective observational study with a repeated measures design. Thirty surgical candidates underwent upMRI. Sagittal and axial T2-weighted images of the three functional postures were evaluated. The segmental length of the lumbar spine (sLLS), the lordotic angle (LA) and the dural cross-sectional area (DCSA) were measured in each body position. Generalized linear mixed models were carried out. The 0.05 level of probability was set as the criterion for statistical significance. RESULTS: The prevalence of RNRs decreased from 80% during standing to 16.7% during flexed sitting (p < 0.001). The sLLS increased significantly from standing to neutral sitting in both RNR groups (p < 0.001). The increase from neutral sitting to flexed sitting was only significant (p < 0.001) for the group without RNRs (RNR-). The LA decreased significantly for both RNR groups from standing to flexed sitting (p < 0.001). The DSCA increased significantly in the RNR- group (p < 0.001) but not in the RNR+ group (p = 0.9). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of RNRs is body position dependent. Increases in DCSA play a determinant role in resolving RNRs.

N2  - A 24-year-old woman was hit by a bus and suffered an isolated complete oculomotor  nerve palsy. Computed tomography scan did not show a skull base fracture. T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed petechial cerebral hemorrhages sparing the brainstem. T2 constructive interference in steady state suggested a partial sectioning of the left oculomotor nerve just before entering the superior orbital fissure. Diffusion tensor imaging fiber tractography confirmed a sharp arrest of the left oculomotor nerve. This recent imaging technique could be of interest to assess white fiber damage and help make a diagnosis or prognosis.

N2  - PURPOSE: Panoramical radiographs or cone-beam computed tomography (CT) are the  standard-of-care in dental imaging to assess teeth, mandible, and mandibular canal pathologies, but do not allow assessment of the inferior alveolar nerve itself nor of its branches. We propose a new technique for "MR neurographic orthopantomograms" exploiting ultrashort echo-time (UTE) imaging of bone and teeth complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Institutional Review Board approved the study in 10 healthy volunteers. Imaging of the subjects mandibles at 3.0T (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens-Healthcare) using a 64-channel head coil with isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar reformatting, was performed. Bone images were acquired using a 3D PETRA sequence (TE, 0.07 msec). Morphological nerve imaging was performed using a dedicated 3D PSIF and 3D SPACE STIR sequence. Functional MR neurography was accomplished using a new accelerated diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) prototype sequence (2D SMS-accelerated RESOLVE). Qualitative and quantitative image analysis was performed and descriptive statistics are provided. RESULTS: Image acquisition and subsequent postprocessing into the MR neurographic orthopantomogram by overlay of morphological and functional images were feasible in all 10 volunteers without artifacts. All mandibular bones and mandibular nerves were assessable and considered normal. Fiber tractography with quantitative evaluation of physiological diffusion properties of mandibular nerves yielded the following mean ± SD values: fractional anisotropy, 0.43 ± 0.07; mean diffusivity (mm(2) /s), 0.0014 ± 0.0002; axial diffusivity, 0.0020 ± 0.0002, and radial diffusivity, 0.0011 ± 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The proposed technique of MR neurographic orthopantomogram exploiting UTE imaging complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography was feasible and allowed comprehensive assessment of osseous texture and neural microarchitecture in a single examination.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2  measurements in the evaluation of radiation-induced peripheral nerve injury (RIPNI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: RIPNI was produced in a randomly selected side of sciatic nerve in each of 21 rabbits while the contralateral side served as the control. The limb function and MR parameters were evaluated over a 4-month period. Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (λ∥ ), radial diffusivity (λ⊥ ) and T2 values were obtained using 3T MR for quantitative analysis. Two animals were randomly killed for histological evaluation at each timepoint. RESULTS: The T2 value of irradiated nerve increased at 1 day (63.95 ± 15.60, P = 0.012) and was restored at 1 month (52.34 ± 5.38, P = 0.105). It increased progressively at 2 to 4 months (60.39 ± 10.60, 66.96 ± 6.08, 75.51 ± 7.39, all P < 0.01). λ⊥ significantly increased at 1 day (0.82 ± 0.44, P = 0.046) and slightly decreased at 1 month (0.61 ± 0.17, P < 0.001). It increased gradually from 2 to 3 months (0.84 ± 0.29, 1.13 ± 0.33, both P < 0.001) followed by a decline at 4 months (0.83 ± 0.17, P < 0.001). FA was statistically lower than the contralateral sides at 1 to 4 months (0.72 ± 0.08, 0.60 ± 0.12, 0.51 ± 0.11, 0.62 ± 0.06, all P < 0.01). Changes in FA and λ⊥ correlated well with the functional and pathological changes in irradiated nerve. CONCLUSION: DTI may be a more sensitive and accurate method to evaluate RIPNI compared with T2 measurements. FA and λ⊥ are promising quantitative indices in monitoring RIPNI. J. Magn. Reson.

N2  - Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is commonly associated with deficits in executive  functions such as working memory and inhibitory control. A valid biomarker to describe the pathological basis of these deficits in NF1 is not available. The aim of this study was to investigate whether any abnormalities in white matter integrity of the executive function related anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), cingulate bundle (CB), and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) may be regarded as a pathological basis for inhibitory control deficits in adolescents with NF1. Sixteen NF1 patients and 32 healthy controls underwent 3 T DTI MRI scanning. Whole brain-, ATR-, CB-, and SLF-white matter integrity were studied using fractional anisotropy, mean (MD), radial, and axial (DA) diffusivity. Correlation analyses between white matter metrics and inhibitory control (as measured with a computerized task) were performed. Also, verbal and performance abilities (IQ-estimates) were assessed and correlated with white matter metrics. Patients showed significant whole brain- and local microstructural pathology when compared to healthy controls in all measures. In NF1-patients, whole-brain (MD: r = .646 and DA: r = .673) and ATR- (r-range: -.405-.771), but not the CB- (r-range: -.307-.472) and SLF- (r-range: -.187-.406) white matter integrity, were correlated with inhibitory control. Verbal and performance abilities were not associated with white matter pathology. In NF1, white matter abnormalities are observed throughout the brain, but damage to the ATR seems specifically, or at least most strongly related to inhibitory control. Future studies should examine whether reduced white matter integrity in other brain regions or tracts is (more strongly) associated with different aspects of the cognitive-behavioral phenotype associated with NF1.

N2  - Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe and yet most poorly understood  complications of diabetes mellitus. In vivo imaging of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a key structure for the understanding of DPN, has been restricted to animal studies. These have shown a correlation of decreased DRG volume with neuropathic symptom severity. Our objective was to investigate correlations of DRG morphology and signal characteristics at 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) with clinical and serological data in diabetic patients with and without DPN. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent 3T MRN of both L5 DRG using an isotropic 3D T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence with subsequent segmentation of DRG volume and analysis of normalized signal properties. Overall, 55 diabetes patients (66 ± 9 years; 32 men; 30 with DPN) took part in this study. DRG volume was smaller in patients with severe DPN when compared to patients with mild or moderate DPN (134.7 ± 21.86 vs 170.1 ± 49.22; p = 0.040). In DPN patients, DRG volume was negatively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r = -0.43; 95%CI = -0.66 to -0.14; p = 0.02), a measure of neuropathy severity. DRG volume showed negative correlations with triglycerides (r = -0.40; 95%CI = -0.57 to -0.19; p = 0.006), and LDL cholesterol (r = -0.33; 95%CI = -0.51 to -0.11; p = 0.04). There was a strong positive correlation of normalized MR signal intensity (SI) with the neuropathy symptom score in the subgroup of patients with painful DPN (r = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.46 to 0.93; p = 0.005). DRG SI was positively correlated with HbA1c levels (r = 0.30; 95%CI = 0.09 to 0.50; p = 0.03) and the triglyceride/HDL ratio (r = 0.40; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.57; p = 0.007). In this first in vivo study, we found DRG morphological degeneration and signal increase in correlation with neuropathy severity. This elucidates the potential importance of MR-based DRG assessments in studying structural and functional changes in DPN.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To achieve 3-dimensional (3D) display of peripheral nerves in the wrist  region by using maximum intensity projection (MIP) post-processing methods to reconstruct raw images acquired by a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan, and to explore its clinical applications. METHODS: We performed DTI scans in 6 (DTI6) and 25 (DTI25) diffusion directions on 20 wrists of 10 healthy young volunteers, 6 wrists of 5 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, 6 wrists of 6 patients with nerve lacerations, and one patient with neurofibroma. The MIP post-processing methods employed 2 types of DTI raw images: (1) single-direction and (2) T2-weighted trace. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median and ulnar nerves were measured at multiple testing sites. Two radiologists used custom evaluation scales to assess the 3D nerve imaging quality independently. RESULTS: In both DTI6 and DTI25, nerves in the wrist region could be displayed clearly by the 2 MIP post-processing methods. The FA and ADC values were not significantly different between DTI6 and DTI25, except for the FA values of the ulnar nerves at the level of pisiform bone (p=0.03). As to the imaging quality of each MIP post-processing method, there were no significant differences between DTI6 and DTI25 (p>0.05). The imaging quality of single-direction MIP post-processing was better than that from T2-weighted traces (p<0.05) because of the higher nerve signal intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional displays of peripheral nerves in the wrist region can be achieved by MIP post-processing for single-direction images and T2-weighted trace images for both DTI6 and DTI25. The FA and ADC values of the median nerves can be accurately measured by using DTI6 data. Adopting 6-direction DTI scan and MIP post-processing is an efficient method for evaluating peripheral nerves.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Preserving the facial nerve (FN) during surgery for large vestibular  schwannomas (VSs) is challenging because of the unpredictable locations and morphologic changes in the FN. Diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking (DTI-FT) has been proposed to preoperatively visualize the FN. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of DTI-FT for predicting FN location and shape in patients with large VSs. METHODS: In this prospective study, imaging data from 30 consecutive patients with large VSs were obtained using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging. The DTI-FT results included the location of the reconstructed FN relative to the tumor, and maximal fractional anisotropy (MFA) threshold values for FN tracking were determined with iPlan software. Intraoperative findings including the location of FN relative to the tumor and shape were determined by microscopic observations and electrophysiologic monitoring. A correlation analysis was performed between the DTI-FT results and intraoperative findings. RESULTS: Preoperative visualization of the FN using DTI-FT was successful in all 30 patients. The location of the cisternal segment of the FN in relation to the tumors predicted by DTI-FT was consistent with the intraoperative findings in 29 (96.7%) of the 30 patients. The area under the curve of MFA for differentiation between the compact and flat FN was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.98) (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: DTI-FT with modified tracking settings was useful to preoperatively predict the location of FN in patients with large VSs. The MFA of FN demonstrated moderate diagnostic performance for distinguishing compact from flat FNs.

N2  - Neurofibromatosis bright objects (NBOs) are poorly understood. This article aimed to  investigate: 1) differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) between NBOs based in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and 2) the relationship between NBOs and the affected white matter tracts. Fourteen NF1 patients were included in this study. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, radial diffusivity (RD) and eigenvalues were used to compare NBOs and matching contralateral normal-appearing sites (NAS). Diffusion tensor imaging scalars were also compared with age-matched healthy controls. Fiber tractography was performed to assess NBO-induced changes in WM trajectories. ADC values were higher for GM and WM NBOs than for NAS and controls. FA values were lower in GM and WM NBOs compared with controls. In all regions, eigenvalues were higher in NBOs than in NAS and controls. Only three out of 18 NOBs appeared to disrupt WM tracts. ADC, λ2 and RD values of WM NBOs were higher in symptomatic compared to asymptomatic patients. Increased ADC, RD and eigenvalues and decreased FA values in NBOs can be explained by myelin and axonal damage. Increased ADC values and RD in WM NBOs correlated with the presence of symptoms. Tract integrity predominated in our study.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using  simultaneous multislice (SMS) acquisition with blipped controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (CAIPI) for accelerated readout-segmented echo planar imaging (rs-EPI) of the mandibular nerves. DTI of the mandibular nerves using EPI is challenging due to susceptibility artifacts. Rs-EPI is less prone to artifacts but associated with longer scan durations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight asymptomatic volunteers were imaged at 3T using a 64-channel head/neck coil. Conventional, 2-fold (2xSMS) and 3-fold (3xSMS) slice-accelerated rs-EPI sequences were acquired. Tractography of the mandibular nerves was performed. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and number of tracts were calculated. Artifacts were evaluated qualitatively on Likert scales. Parameters were compared statistically. Clinical feasibility of 2xSMS rs-EPI was tested in four patients. RESULTS: SNR was similar for conventional (mean ± SD; 8.55 ± 3.90) and 2xSMS rs-EPI (7.83 ± 3.15) but lower for 3xSMS rs-EPI (5.42 ± 2.93; analysis of variance, P = 0.004). FA was similar for all sequences (rs-EPI, 0.42 ± 0.08; 2xSMS rs-EPI, 0.43 ± 0.08; 3xSMS rs-EPI, 0.44 ± 0.06), while 3xSMS rs-EPI showed lower MD (rs-EPI, 0.0015 ± 0.0003; 2xSMS rs-EPI, 0.0014 ± 0.0001; 3xSMS rs-EPI, 0.0013 ± 0.0003) and lower number of tracts (rs-EPI, 66.56 ± 51.31; 2xSMS rs-EPI, 65.75 ± 55.40; 3xSMS rs-EPI, 37.93 ± 52.42) compared to rs-EPI and 2xSMS rs-EPI. Additionally, 2xSMS rs-EPI was feasible in four clinical patients and provided robust imaging results. CONCLUSION: 2xSMS rs-EPI yielded similar SNR, FA, and MD values compared to conventional rs-EPI at reduced scan time and is feasible in clinical patients. These findings suggest the potential clinical applicability of rs-EPI for DTI of the mandibular nerve. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J. MAGN. RESON. IMAGING 2017;46:663-677.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Epineural scar formation is one of the most significant negative factors  affecting surgical repair after peripheral nerve injury. The scar tissue mechanically hinders axonal regeneration and causes adhesions between nerves and surrounding tissues. A hemostatic agent Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS; İmmun Gıda İlaç Kozmetik San. ve Tic. Ltd. Şti., Istanbul, Turkey) has not been previously used. Decreasing the postoperative bleeding and adhesions between nerve and surrounding tissues will prevent the formation of scar tissue, as well as corresponding compressive neuropathy and/or deceleration of axonal regeneration. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the effects of bleeding on nerve healing and scar tissue after repair of peripheral nerve injuries. METHODS: The right sciatic nerve of 30 Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 260-330 g) was cut 1.5 cm proximal to the trifurcation and repaired primarily with 8/0 sutures using epineural technique. The rats were then divided into 3 groups. Saline was applied in Group 1 (n=10), ABS in Group 2 (n=10), and heparin in Group 3 (n=10) for 5 minutes to the repair site and surrounding tissues. In each group, electrophysiological measurements were performed with electromyography (EMG) at postoperative week 12. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used at week 12. Macroscopical and histopathological evaluations were conducted after sacrificing the rats at week 24 with total excision of the repaired sciatic nerves and surrounding tissues. RESULTS: The ABS and saline groups showed better healing than the heparin group. The ABS and saline groups were better in the histopathologic evaluations, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Statistically significant differences were not found between the 3 groups. Significant results may be obtained with larger studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prolonged T2 relaxation time of denervated muscle has been  described in several clinical and experimental studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of MR imaging in the diagnosis of neurogenic muscle disorders compared with that of clinical and electrophysiologic examination. METHODS: In a prospective study, 40 consecutive patients clinically presenting with a foot drop were included. MR imaging of the lower leg included axial T1-weighted and axial turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM) sequences. Two readers blinded to clinical data evaluated T1-weighted images for anatomic localization of affected muscles and TIRM images for patterns of signal intensity increase. After MR imaging, a detailed neurophysiologic examination was performed. Cause of foot drop was independently determined on the basis of MR and electrophysiologic data. RESULTS: Clinical examination and electromyography (EMG) disclosed 20 peroneal nerve lesions, nine cases of L5 radiculopathy, and 11 nerve lesions extending beyond neural structures. MR imaging revealed three distinct patterns of signal intensity increase on TIRM images: peroneal nerve pattern, L5 pattern, and unspecific pattern. MR imaging and EMG findings were in agreement in 37 (92%) of 40 patients. In three patients, MR imaging revealed a more widespread involvement than did EMG. In one of these patients, denervation in the corresponding muscle was validated by follow-up EMG. No false-negative diagnoses were made by use of MR imaging as compared with use of EMG. CONCLUSION: MR imaging improves accuracy in the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve lesions compared with that of EMG and can supplement EMG in the diagnosis of denervated muscles.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In NF 1 patients, significant numbers of so-called unidentified bright  objects (UBOs) can be found. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the detectability of UBOs increases at 3T by comparing Proton density-weighted images (PDw) with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 14 NF1 patients (7 male, 7 female, between 8 and 26 years old, mean age 15.4 years) were examined by a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. The presence of UBOs was evaluated on PD-w and FLAIR images by 4 evaluators. Detectability was rated by a three-point scoring system: lesions which were "well defined/detectable", "suspicious" or "detected after a second look". The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparisons between the raters. The level of significance was P < 0.05. RESULTS: Significantly more lesions were marked as "well defined/detectable" in the PD-w Sequence compared to FLAIR at 3T (P < 0.001 for all four evaluators together, as well as for each evaluator separately). In particular, PD-w proved to be superior for detecting UBOs located in the medulla oblongata, dentate nucleus and hippocampal region, regardless of the level of the raters' experience. CONCLUSION: This is the first study which compares FLAIR and PD-w at 3T for the diagnosis of UBOs in NF1. At this field strength significantly more UBOs were detected in the PD-w compared to FLAIR sequences, especially for the infratentorial regions. As UBOs occur at very early stages of the disease in patients with suspected NF1, PD-w might aid in the early diagnosis when using 3T scanners.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of simultaneous T(2) mapping and neurography  with nerve-sheath signal increased with inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of relaxation enhancement imaging (SHINKEI) in the lumbar plexus to distinguish patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) from healthy controls. METHODS: Our institutional review boards approved this retrospective study, and written informed consent was waived. 10 patients with CIDP from 2015 to 2017 were studied along with 5 healthy controls on a 3 T scanner. The T(2) relaxation time and the size of the dorsal root ganglia and nerves of the lumbar plexus at L3-S1 were measured. Statistical analyses were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and a receiver operating characteristics analysis. RESULTS: The T(2) relaxation times of the dorsal root ganglia and the nerves of the lumbar plexus were longer in the CIDP patients (133.34  ±  41.36 and 130.40 ± 47.78 ms) compared to the healthy controls (114.69 ± 24.90 and 83.72 ± 17.51 ms, p = 0.0265 and p < 0.0001, respectively). The sizes of the nerves were larger in the CIDP patients (6.19  ±  2.28 mm) compared to the controls (4.54  ±  0.86 mm, p < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between the sizes of the ganglia in the CIDP patients and the controls. The receiver operating characteristics analysis revealed that the T(2) relaxation time of the nerves was best at distinguishing the CIDP patients from the controls (Az  =  0.848). CONCLUSION: Patients with CIDP could be distinguished from healthy controls using simultaneous T(2) mapping and neurography with SHINKEI in the lumbar plexus. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Patients with CIDP could be distinguished from healthy controls using simultaneous T(2) mapping and neurography with SHINKEI in the lumbar plexus.

N2  - PURPOSE: Lumbar paraspinal muscle morphology has recently been evaluated in several  studies with conflicting results. Several studies have performed single-slice evaluations of paraspinal muscle morphology, whereas other studies have done a multi-level assessment; this methodological difference might explain the observed different results. Our study evaluated if a single-slice axial measurement is representative of the entire lumbar musculature. METHODS: We included 80 adult patients who were consecutively evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for spinal symptoms. Using T2-weighted axial images, we measured the fat signal fractions (FSF) and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the erector spinae and multifidus at the five levels of the lumbar spine (from L1-L2 to L5-S1). We used the ANOVA test for repeated measurements (with Bonferroni correction) to compare the FSF and CSA among the levels. RESULTS: Erector spinae showed an increasing FSF from L1-L2 to L5-S1; all erector spinae FSF comparisons among the different levels were significantly different. Multifidus FSF also increased caudally below L2-L3, although significant differences were observed only with two or more levels of distance. The CSA of the erector spinae showed a caudal decrease (L4-L5 and L5-S1 being significantly smaller than all the levels above). The CSA of the multifidus showed that all levels exhibited a significantly different area compared to their adjacent level (except L5-S1 compared to L4-L5). CONCLUSIONS: No single-level FSF or CSA is representative of the whole lumbar spine. A standardized multi-level evaluation of the paraspinal musculature should be used in future research.

N2  - OBJECTIVE The depiction of cranial nerves (CNs) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)  is of great interest in skull base tumor surgery and DTI used with deterministic tracking methods has been reported previously. However, there are still no good methods usable for the elimination of noise from the resulting depictions. The authors have hypothesized that probabilistic tracking could lead to more accurate results, because it more efficiently extracts information from the underlying data. Moreover, the authors have adapted a previously described technique for noise elimination using gradual threshold increases to probabilistic tracking. To evaluate the utility of this new approach, a comparison is provided with this work between the gradual threshold increase method in probabilistic and deterministic tracking of CNs. METHODS Both tracking methods were used to depict CNs II, III, V, and the VII+VIII bundle. Depiction of 240 CNs was attempted with each of the above methods in 30 healthy subjects, which were obtained from 2 public databases: the Kirby repository (KR) and Human Connectome Project (HCP). Elimination of erroneous fibers was attempted by gradually increasing the respective thresholds (fractional anisotropy [FA] and probabilistic index of connectivity [PICo]). The results were compared with predefined ground truth images based on corresponding anatomical scans. Two label overlap measures (false-positive error and Dice similarity coefficient) were used to evaluate the success of both methods in depicting the CN. Moreover, the differences between these parameters obtained from the KR and HCP (with higher angular resolution) databases were evaluated. Additionally, visualization of 10 CNs in 5 clinical cases was attempted with both methods and evaluated by comparing the depictions with intraoperative findings. RESULTS Maximum Dice similarity coefficients were significantly higher with probabilistic tracking (p < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The false-positive error of the last obtained depiction was also significantly lower in probabilistic than in deterministic tracking (p < 0.001). The HCP data yielded significantly better results in terms of the Dice coefficient in probabilistic tracking (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test) and in deterministic tracking (p = 0.02). The false-positive errors were smaller in HCP data in deterministic tracking (p < 0.001) and showed a strong trend toward significance in probabilistic tracking (p = 0.06). In the clinical cases, the probabilistic method visualized 7 of 10 attempted CNs accurately, compared with 3 correct depictions with deterministic tracking. CONCLUSIONS High angular resolution DTI scans are preferable for the DTI-based depiction of the cranial nerves. Probabilistic tracking with a gradual PICo threshold increase is more effective for this task than the previously described deterministic tracking with a gradual FA threshold increase and might represent a method that is useful for depicting cranial nerves with DTI since it eliminates the erroneous fibers without manual intervention.

N2  - SPG11 mutations lead to heterogeneous neurological phenotypes, but metabolic  abnormalities have not yet been explored in this disease. In this study, we investigate whether SPG11 pathogenic variants might affect metabolic regulation, leading to weight changes and if this could relate to hypothalamic damage. In this cross-sectional case-control study, we selected a group of individuals with confirmed SPG11 mutations (n = 20), paired with healthy controls - both groups underwent brain MRI, from which we performed manual hypothalamic segmentation - and patients with Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA), having collected weight and height data for BMI-comparison. In the SPG11 group, we found significantly higher BMI compared to FRDA (p = .034), as well as hypothalamic atrophy compared to controls (p = .030). Volumetric changes were not associated with BMI, age, disease duration or SPRS amongst subjects with SPG11. Therefore, this study presents a new feature in SPG11 by characterizing a higher obesity rate in these patients, that could be associated with the hypothalamic atrophy found in this population.

N2  - PURPOSE: The optic nerve (ON) represents the sole pathway between the eyes and  brain; consequently, diseases of the ON can have dramatic effects on vision. However, quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) applications in the ON have been limited to ex vivo studies, in part because of the fatty connective tissue that surrounds the ON, confounding the magnetization transfer (MT) experiment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to implement a multi-echo Dixon fat-water separation approach to remove the fat component from MT images. METHODS: MT measurements were taken in a single slice of the ON and frontal lobe using a three-echo Dixon readout, and the water and out-of-phase images were applied to a two-pool model in ON tissue and brain white matter to evaluate the effectiveness of using Dixon fat-water separation to remove fatty tissue from MT images. RESULTS: White matter data showed no significant differences between image types; however, there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in variation in the out-of-phase images in the ON relative to the water images. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that Dixon fat-water separation can be robustly used for accurate MT quantification of anatomies susceptible to partial volume effects resulting from fat.

N2  - Alpha-mannosidosis is a disease caused by the deficient activity of  alpha-mannosidase, a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the degradation of glycoproteins. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides within lysosomes. The purpose of this study was to characterize the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) myelin abnormalities in cats from a breeding colony with a uniform mutation in the gene encoding alpha-mannosidase. Three affected cats and 3 normal cats from 2 litters were examined weekly from 4 to 18 wk of age. Progressively worsening neurological signs developed in affected cats that included tremors, loss of balance, and nystagmus. In the PNS, affected cats showed slow motor nerve conduction velocity and increased F-wave latency. Single nerve fiber teasing revealed significant demyelination/remyelination in affected cats. Mean G-ratios of nerves showed a significant increase in affected cats compared to normal cats. Magnetic resonance imaging of the CNS revealed diffuse white matter signal abnormalities throughout the brain of affected cats. Quantitative magnetization transfer imaging showed a 8%-16% decrease in the magnetization transfer ratio in brain white matter of affected cats compared to normal cats, consistent with myelin abnormalities. Histology confirmed myelin loss throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. Thus, histology, electrodiagnostic testing, and magnetic resonance imaging identified significant myelination abnormalities in both the PNS and CNS that have not been described previously in alpha-mannosidosis.

N2  - Previous research has not established a consistent difference in hand size or carpal  tunnel cross-sectional area between patients with and without carpal tunnel syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that there would be no difference in relative carpal tunnel sizes between men and women. We defined relative carpal tunnel size as the cross-sectional areas at the inlet (level of the pisiform) and outlet (level of the hook of the hamate) of the carpal tunnel divided by the length of the capitate (as a measure of hand size). We made the measurements on the magnetic resonance imaging scans of 50 men and 50 women taken for symptoms unrelated to carpal tunnel syndrome. The mean relative cross-sectional area was appreciably smaller in women than men (p < 0.05). This suggests that the carpal tunnel cross-sectional area relative to the size of the hand is constitutionally smaller in women than in men. This could in theory be a significant factor in patients developing carpal tunnel syndrome. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To translate the quantitative MRC Centre MRI protocol in  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) to a second site; validate its responsiveness in an independent cohort; and test the benefit of participant stratification to increase outcome measure responsiveness. METHODS: Three healthy volunteers were scanned for intersite standardization. For the longitudinal patient study, 11 patients with CMT1A were recruited with 10 patients rescanned at a 12-month interval. Three-point Dixon MRI of leg muscles was performed to generate fat fraction (FF) maps, transferred to a central site for quality control and analysis. Clinical data collected included CMT Neuropathy Score. RESULTS: Test-retest reliability of FF within individual healthy calf muscles at the remote site was excellent: intraclass correlation coefficient 0.79, limits of agreement -0.67 to +0.85 %FF. In patients, mean calf muscle FF was 21.0% and correlated strongly with disease severity and age. Calf muscle FF significantly increased over 12 months (+1.8 ± 1.7 %FF, p = 0.009). Patients with baseline FF >10% showed a 12-month FF increase of 2.9% ± 1.3% (standardized response mean = 2.19). CONCLUSIONS: We have validated calf muscle FF as an outcome measure in an independent cohort of patients with CMT1A. Responsiveness is significantly improved by enrolling a stratified patient cohort with baseline calf FF >10%.

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine the possibility of performing high-resolution MRI  (microneurography) on peripheral nerves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A specific radio frequency (RF) coil was developed to probe the human median nerve at a magnetic field strength of 9.4 T and tested on three excised samples by acquiring microneurograms. RESULTS: The microneurograms revealed neuronal tissue constituents at subfascicular level. The contrast features on proton-density and T1- and T2-weighted images were described and compared. The microscopic water movement was quantified using diffusion weighting parallel and orthogonal to the neuronal fiber orientation. The characteristics of anisotropic diffusion in the median nerve were comparable to those reported from other biological tissues (white matter and kidney). CONCLUSION: The results overall suggest that microneurography might provide new noninvasive insights into microscopic gross anatomy of the peripheral nerve, injury evaluation, and efficacy of repair, although the feasibility at current clinically relevant field strengths is yet to be determined.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of greater occipital nerve (GON) intermediate  site infiltration with MRI guidance. METHODS: Eleven consecutive patients suffering from chronic refractory cranio-facial pain who underwent 16 GON infiltrations were included in this prospective study. All of the procedures were performed on an outpatient basis in the research facility of our institution, with a 1.5 T scanner. The fatty space between inferior obliquus and semispinalis muscles at C1-C2 level was defined as the target. Technical success was defined as the ability to accurately inject the products at the target, assessed by post-procedure axial and sagittal proton density-weighted sequences. Clinical success was defined as a 50% pain decrease at 1 month. RESULTS: Technical success was 100%. GON was depicted in 6/11 cases on planning MRI sequences. Mean duration of procedure was 22.5 min (range 16-41). Clinical success was obtained in 7/11 included patients (63.6%) with a mean self-reported improvement of 78%. CONCLUSION: Interventional MR-guidance for GON infiltration is a feasible technique offering similar results to an already established effective procedure. It may appear as a useful tool in specific populations, such as young patients and repeat infiltrations, and should be considered in these settings. KEY POINTS: • MR guidance for GON infiltration is a feasible technique. • Preliminary results are in agreement with other guidance modalities. • MR guidance may be seen as a useful tool in specific populations. • Specific populations include young patients and repeat infiltrations. • Target patients may also include patients with potentionally previously reported complications (torticollis).

N2  - Peripheral nerve disorders may be classified into compressive or entrapment  neuropathies and non-compressive neuropathies. Muscle denervation recognized on MRI may be a useful sign in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve disorders. Acute or subacute denervation results in prolonged T2 relaxation time, producing increased signal in skeletal muscle on short tau inversion-recovery and fat-suppressed T2-weighted images. Chronic denervation produces fatty atrophy of skeletal muscles, resulting in increased muscle signal on T1-weighted images. This review will outline and illustrate the various ways that muscle denervation as seen on MRI may assist in the diagnosis and localization of peripheral nerve disorders.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are  widely used in the evaluation of the central nervous system and recently have been reported as a potential tool for diagnosis of the peripheral nerve or the lumbar nerve entrapment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate consecutive changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of normal lumbar nerve roots from the junction of the dura mater. METHODS: The lumbar spinal nerves were examined in 6 male healthy volunteers (mean age, 35 years) with no experiences of sciatica, with a 3.0-T MR unit using a five-element phased-array surface coil. DTI was performed with the following imaging parameters: 11084.6/73.7 ms for TR/TE; b-value, 800 s/mm2; MPG, 33 directions; slice thickness, 1.5 mm; and total scan time, 7 min 35 s. ADC and FA values at all consecutive points along the L4, L5 and S1 nerves were quantified on every 1.5 mm slice from the junction of the dura mater using short fiber tracking. RESULTS: ADC values of all L4, 5, and S1 nerve roots decreased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction and was constant distally afterward. ADC values in the proximal portion demonstrated S1 > L5 > L4 (p < 0.05). On the other hand, FA values increased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction, and was constant distally afterward. FA values in the proximal portion showed L4 > L5 > S1 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that ADC and FA values of each L4, 5, and S1 at the proximal portion from the junction of the dura matter changed linearly. It would be useful to know the normal profile of DTI values by location of each nerve root so that we can detect subtle abnormalities in each nerve root.

N2  - Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) has been reported as one of the most common peripheral  neuropathies. Carpal tunnel segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images is important for the evaluation of CTS. To date, manual segmentation, which is time-consuming and operator dependent, remains the most common approach for the analysis of the carpal tunnel structure. Therefore, we propose a new knowledge-based method for automatic segmentation of the carpal tunnel from MR images. The proposed method first requires the segmentation of the carpal tunnel from the most proximally cross-sectional image. Three anatomical features of the carpal tunnel are detected by watershed and polygonal curve fitting algorithms to automatically initialize a deformable model as close to the carpal tunnel in the given image as possible. The model subsequently deforms toward the tunnel boundary based on image intensity information, shape bending degree, and the geometry constraints of the carpal tunnel. After the deformation process, the carpal tunnel in the most proximal image is segmented and subsequently applied to a contour propagation step to extract the tunnel contours sequentially from the remaining cross-sectional images. MR volumes from 15 subjects were included in the validation experiments. Compared with the ground truth of two experts, our method showed good agreement on tunnel segmentations by an average margin of error within 1 mm and dice similarity coefficient above 0.9.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this preliminary study were to determine the number of  axonal bundles (fascicles) in the median nerve, using a high-resolution, proton density (PD)-turbo spin echo (TSE) fat suppression sequence, and to determine normative T2 values, measured by triple-echo steady state, of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), at 7 T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted between March 2014 and January 2015. All study participants gave written informed consent. Six healthy volunteers (30 ± 12 years) and 5 patients with CTS (44 ± 16 years) were included. Measurements were performed on both wrists in all volunteers and on the affected wrist in patients (3 right, 2 left). Based on 5-point scales, 2 readers assessed image quality (1, very poor; 5, very good) and the presence of artifacts that might have a possible influence on fascicle determination (1, severe artifacts; 5, no artifacts) and counted the number of fascicles independently on the PD-TSE sequences. Furthermore, T2 values by region of interest analysis were assessed. Student t tests, a hierarchic linear model, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Proton density-TSE image quality and artifacts revealed a median of 5 in healthy volunteers and 4 in patients with CTS for both readers. Fascicle count of the median nerve ranged from 13 to 23 in all subjects, with an ICC of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.95). T2 values were significantly higher (P = 0.023) in patients (24.27 ± 0.97 milliseconds [95% CI, 22.19-26.38]) compared with healthy volunteers (21.01 ± 0.65 milliseconds [95% CI, 19.61-22.41]). The ICC for all T2 values was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the possibility of fascicle determination of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and patients with CTS (although probably less accurately) with high-resolution 7 T magnetic resonance imaging, as well as significantly higher T2 values in patients with CTS, which seems to be associated with pathophysiological nerve changes.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aims to compare engineered nerve conduits constructed from  porcine-derived urinary bladder matrix (UBM) with the criterion-standard nerve autografts, for segmental loss peripheral nerve repairs. METHODS: Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups. All underwent a 10-mm sciatic nerve gap injury. This was repaired using either (1) reverse autograft-the 10-mm cut segment was oriented 180 degrees and used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps or (2) UBM conduit-the 10-mm nerve gap was bridged with UBM conduit. Behavior assessments such as sciatic function index and foot fault asymmetry scores were performed weekly. At 3- or 6-week time endpoints, the repaired nerves and bilateral gastrocnemius/soleus muscles were harvested from each animal. Nerves were evaluated using immunohistochemistry for motor and sensory axon staining and with diffusion tensor imaging. The net wet muscle weights were calculated to assess the degree of muscle atrophy. RESULTS: The UBM group demonstrated significantly improved foot fault asymmetry scores at 2 and 4 weeks, whereas there was no difference in sciatic function index. The net muscle weights were similar between both groups. Motor axon counts proximal/inside/distal to the conduit/graft were similar between UBM conduits and reverse autografts, whereas sensory axon counts within and distal to the conduit were significantly higher than those of the autograft at 6 weeks. Sensory axonal regeneration seemed to be adherent to the inner surface of the UBM conduit, whereas it had a scattered appearance in autografts. Diffusion tensor imaging parameters between groups were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary bladder matrix conduits prove to be at least similar to nerve autografts for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries with a short gap. The matrix perhaps serves as a scaffold to augment sensory nerve growth. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In a clinical setting, UBM may eliminate the donor site morbidity and increased operative time associated with nerve autografting.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The safe performance of regional anaesthesia (RA) requires theoretical  knowledge and good manual skills. Virtual reality (VR)-based simulators may offer trainees a safe environment to learn and practice different techniques. However, currently available VR simulators do not consider individual anatomy, which limits their use for realistic training. We have developed a VR-based simulator that can be used for individual anatomy and for different anatomical regions. METHODS: Individual data were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) without contrast agent to represent morphology and the vascular system, respectively. For data handling, registration, and segmentation, an application based on the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit was developed. Suitable segmentation algorithms such as the fuzzy c-means clustering approach were integrated, and a hierarchical tree data structure was created to model the flexible anatomical structures of peripheral nerve cords. The simulator was implemented in the VR toolkit ViSTA using modules for collision detection, virtual humanoids, interaction, and visualization. A novel algorithm for electric impulse transmission is the core of the simulation. RESULTS: In a feasibility study, MRI morphology and MRA were acquired from five subjects for the inguinal region. From these sources, three-dimensional anatomical data sets were created and nerves modelled. The resolution obtained from both MRI and MRA was sufficient for realistic simulations. Our high-fidelity simulator application allows trainees to perform virtual peripheral nerve blocks based on these data sets and models. CONCLUSIONS: Subject-specific training of RA is supported in a virtual environment. We have adapted segmentation algorithms and developed a VR-based simulator for the inguinal region for use in training for different peripheral nerve blocks. In contrast to available VR-based simulators, our simulation offers anatomical variety.

N2  - Spinal cord injuries (SCI) normally disrupt the long axonal tracts of the spinal  cord and cause permanent neurological deficits, for which there is currently a lack of effective therapeutic methods. Biomaterial-based regenerative medicine is a pivotal strategy to induce axonal regeneration through delivery of biophysical and/or biochemical regulatory cues by biomaterials. We previously fabricated a hierarchically aligned fibrin hydrogel (AFG) that could promote neurogenic differentiation of stem cells in vitro and has been successfully applied for peripheral nerve and spinal cord regeneration in rats. In this study, AFG was used to repair a canine lumbar segment 2 hemisection spinal cord injury, and the consistency of histological, imageological and behavioral results was compared. AFG was used to construct an aligned fiber bridge that supported cell adhesion in vitro and rapidly facilitated tissue invasion along the long axis of fibers in vivo, Moreover, in vivo results demonstrated regrowth of axons in an oriented pattern connecting the rostral and caudal stumps. Consistent results were confirmed by diffusion tensor imaging, which allowed successful tracing of reconnected nerve fibers across the defect. As a result, directional axonal regrowth contributed to significantly improved recovery of motor functional behavior of SCI canines with AFG implantation. Our results suggest that AFG has great promise for rapidly directing axonal regrowth for nerve regeneration.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Management of peripheral nerve injuries requires physicians to rely on  qualitative measures from patient history, electromyography, and physical exam. Determining a successful nerve repair can take months to years for proximal injuries, and the resulting delays in clinical decision-making can lead to a negative impact on patient outcomes. Early identification of a failed nerve repair could prevent permanent muscle atrophy and loss of function. This study aims to test the feasibility of performing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate injury and recovery following repair of wrist trauma. We hypothesize that DTI provides a noninvasive and reliable assessment of regeneration, which may improve clinical decision-making and alter the clinical course of surgical interventions. METHODS: Clinical and MRI measurements from subjects with traumatic peripheral nerve injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, and healthy control subjects were compared to evaluate the relationship between DTI metrics and injury severity. RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy from DTI was sensitive to differences between damaged and healthy nerves, damaged and compressed nerves, and injured and healthy contralateral nerves. Longitudinal measurements in two injury subjects also related to clinical outcomes. Implications of other diffusion measures are also discussed. INTERPRETATION: DTI is a sensitive tool for wrist nerve injuries and can be utilized for monitoring nerve recovery. Across three subjects with nerve injuries, this study has shown how DTI can detect abnormalities between injured and healthy nerves, measure recovery, and determine if re-operation was successful. Additional comparisons to carpal tunnel syndrome and healthy nerves show that DTI is sensitive to the degree of impairment.

N2  - Botulinum neurotoxin A (BTX-A) intervention has long-term benefits for children with  obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP). Although cortical plasticity has been widely studied, plasticity in white matter has not received as much attention. Here, six children with OBPP underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before and 6 months after BTX-A treatment. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded. The aim was to investigate changes in the corticospinal tract (CST) as an example longitudinal observation of white matter plasticity. Deterministic fiber tracking with a Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking algorithm was used to reconstruct the CST. Fiber tracts passing through a region of interest (ROI) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and a target ROI in the upper-limb representation of M1 (defined by task-related fMRI) were selected as the CST. Motor performances were improved while EMG showed no significant difference 6 months after the treatment. We observed a significant increase in mean fractional anisotropy and a significant decrease in fiber number after treatment. We analyzed the correlations between DTI metrics and clinical motor assessments. Although the correlation results were not statistically significant, they support the notion that BTX-A treatment causes white matter plasticity and has a positive long-term outcome. Peripheral deafferentation may lead to altered information flow, resulting in the positive adaptation of white matter. This study provides novel insight into cerebral plasticity following peripheral nerve regeneration and indicates that a combination of relatively non-invasive therapies can accelerate plasticity of sensorimotor circuits and promote functional recovery in OBPP.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of  Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the SACS gene. The disease, first described in Canadian families from Québec, is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract involvement and peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: Analysis of SACS gene allowed the identification of 14 patients with ARSACS from 13 unrelated Italian families. Clinical phenotype, gene mutations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were analysed. RESULTS: We found 16 novel SACS gene mutations, including a large in-frame deletion. The age at onset was in infancy, but one patient presented the first symptoms at age 32. Progression of the disease was variable, and increased muscle tone was mostly recognized in later stages. Structural MRI showed atrophy of the superior cerebellar vermis, a bulky pons exhibiting T2-hypointense stripes, identified as the corticospinal tract (CST), thinning of the corpus callosum and a rim of T2-hyperintensity around the thalami in 100% of cases. The presence of iron or other paramagnetic substances was excluded. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed grossly over-represented transverse pontine fibres (TPF), which prevented reconstruction of the CST at this level (100% of cases). In all patients, significant microstructural alterations were found in the supratentorial white matter of forceps, cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further enlarge the genetic spectrum of SACS mutations and widen the study of clinical phenotype. MRI characteristics indicate that pontine changes and supratentorial abnormalities are diagnostic. The over-representation of TPF on DTI suggests a developmental component in the pathogenesis of the disease.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate manganese (Mn(2+))-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) and diffusion tensor  imaging (DTI) as tools for detection of axonal injury and regeneration after intravitreal peripheral nerve graft (PNG) implantation in the rat optic nerve (ON). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In adult Fischer rats, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival was evaluated in Flurogold (FG) back-filled retinal whole mounts after ON crush (ONC), intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl(2) injection (150 nmol) at 0 and 20 days post lesion (dpl). MEMRI and echo-planar DTI (DTI-EPI) was obtained of noninjured ON one day after intravitreal MnCl(2) injection, and at 1 and 21 dpl after ONC, intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl(2) injections given at 0 and 20 dpl. GAP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed after the last MRI. RESULTS: ONC reduced RGC density in retina by 94% at 21 dpl compared to noninjured ON without MnCl(2) injections. Both intravitreal PNG and intravitreal MnCl(2) injections improved RGC survival in retina, which was reduced by 90% (ONC+MnCl(2)), 82% (ONC+PNG), and 74% (ONC+PNG+MnCl(2)) compared to noninjured ON. DTI-derived parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity lambda( parallel), and radial diffusivity lambda( perpendicular)) were unaffected by the presence of Mn(2+) in the ON. At 1 dpl, CNR(MEMRI) and lambda( parallel) were reduced at the injury site, while at 21 dpl they were increased at the injury site compared to values measured at 1 dpl. GAP-43 immunoreactive axons were present in the ON distal to the ONC injury site. CONCLUSION: MEMRI and DTI enabled detection of functional and structural degradation after rat ON injury, and there was correlation between the MRI-derived and immunohistochemical measures of axon regeneration.

N2  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by  selective motor neuron degeneration in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. It is generally accepted that ALS is caused by death of motor neurons, however the exact temporal cascade of degenerative processes is not yet completely known. To identify the early pathological changes in spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 ALS mice we performed a comprehensive longitudinal analysis employing diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging alongside histology and electron microscopy, in parallel with peripheral nerve histology. We showed the gradient of degeneration appearance in spinal cord white and gray matter, starting earliest in the ventral white matter, due to a cascade of pathological events including axon dysfunction and mitochondrial changes. Notably, we found that even the main sensory regions are affected by the neurodegenerative process at symptomatic disease phase. Overall our results attest the applicability of DTI in determining disease progression in ALS mice. These findings suggest that DTI could be potentially adapted in humans to aid the assessment of ALS progression and eventually the evaluation of treatment efficacy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The use of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and diffusion tensor imaging  (DTI) was evaluated in assessing cochlear nerve deficiency (CND) and its effect on normal maturation of auditory tract. METHODS: 25 CND patients and 25 controls (age matched: 2months to 17years, gender matched) were evaluated by mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis, and radial kurtosis and compared against fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivities in internal auditory canal (IAC), lateral lemniscus (LL) and inferior colliculus (IC). The age related changes of auditory tract were studied through Pearson correlation between estimated indices and age of both CND and control populations. RESULTS: Significant loss of MK (IAC: 10.71%, IC: 10.87%, LL: 15.63%) was observed in CND cases as against moderate reduction in FA (IAC: 8.57%, IC: 10%, LL: 7.69%) in all three anatomical locations. Similarly, substantial decline is observed in radial kurtosis (IAC: 27.03%, IC: 33.33%, LL: 31.43%) in comparison to moderate increase in radial diffusivity (IAC: 13.46%, IC: 24.39%, LL: 24%) in CND cases. No statistically significant change was seen in both axial kurtosis and diffusivities. In control populations, MK (r=0.473, p=0.011) and radial kurtosis (r=0.418, p=0.016) correlate positively with age and had no correlation in case of CND cases. FA (r=0.356, p=0.019) minimally correlated with age in control population but showed no statistically significant correlation in CND cases (r=0.198, p=0.036). CONCLUSION: DKI metrics performed better than DTI in assessing microstructural changes of CND. In particular, MK and radial kurtosis are found to be more sensitive enough to differentiate the normal maturation of cochlear nerve from CND cases.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation during  somatosensory electrical stimulation of the median nerve in acute stroke patients and to determine its correlation with ischemic damage and clinical recovery over time. METHODS: Fourteen acute stroke patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during contralesional median-nerve electrical stimulation 12-48 h after stroke. Findings were then validated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and motor evoked potential by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). RESULTS: Poor clinical recovery at three months was noted in four patients with no activation in the early days after stroke, whereas good clinical recovery was observed in eight patients with a normal activation pattern in the primary sensory motor area in the acute phase. In two patients BOLD activation correlated weakly with clinical recovery. Findings from TMS and DTI partially correlated with clinical recovery and functional scores. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant insights into the "functional reserve" of stroke patients gained with peripheral nerve stimulation during fMRI may carry prognostic value already in the acute period of a cerebrovascular accident. SIGNIFICANCE: BOLD activation maps could provide insights into the functional organization of the residual systems and could contribute to medical decision making in neurological and rehabilitative treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a common inherited axonal  or mixed axonal-demyelinating neuropathy. The disease is caused by mutations in the GJB1 gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin32, which is expressed in both Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Several reports have described CMTX patients presenting with transient and recurrent central nervous system (CNS) symptoms with transient white matter lesions in the brain. PATIENTS: We describe a man with CMTX who presented with transient CNS symptoms and abnormal cerebral white matter lesions in MRI. He was subjected to a detailed MRI examination using two specialized techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). RESULTS: In the early stage of his CNS symptoms, MRS studies revealed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) levels in deep white matter, and DTI revealed reduced fractional anisotropy within lesions. Interestingly, these reductions began to recover from day 19 after admission, and follow-up DTI and MRS studies on day 101 revealed a reversal of the abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The findings of reversible reductions in fractional anisotropy and NAA levels in our patient suggest reversible axonal damage associated with deficient oligodendrocyte gap junctions.

N2  - The pathogenesis of diabetic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP) is poorly  understood but there is some evidence that the disease process might extend beyond peripheral nerves. We used magnetic-resonance imaging to measure spinal-cord cross-sectional area in diabetic patients with and without DSP and in healthy controls. There were significant differences in cord area between the groups at C4/5 and T3/4 (p=0.004 and p=0.033, respectively), with a smaller cord area in those with DSP compared with controls (p=0.001 and p=0.016 for C4/5 and T3/4, respectively). These results indicate that DSP is not simply a disease of the peripheral nerve and that there is substantial involvement of the spinal cord.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Widespread sensory deficits occur in 20-40% of chronic pain patients on  the side of pain, independent of pain aetiology, and are known as nondermatomal sensory deficits (NDSDs). NDSDs can occur in absence of central or peripheral nervous system lesions. We hypothesised that NDSDs were associated with cerebral grey matter changes in the sensory system and in pain processing regions, detectable with voxel-based morphometry. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with NDSDs, 23 patients without NDSDs ("pain-only"), and 29 healthy controls were studied with high resolution structural MRI of the brain. A comprehensive clinical and psychiatric evaluation based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual was performed in all patients. RESULTS: Patients with NDSDs and "pain-only" did not differ concerning demographic data and psychiatric diagnoses, although anxiety scores (HADS-A) were higher in patients with NDSDs. In patients with NDSDs, grey matter increases were found in the right primary sensory cortex, thalamus, and bilaterally in lateral temporal regions and the hippocampus/fusiform gyrus. "Pain-only" patients showed a bilateral grey matter increase in the posterior insula and less pronounced changes in sensorimotor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunctional sensory processing in patients with NDSDs is associated with complex changes in grey matter volume, involving the somatosensory system and temporal regions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is widely expressed in the human brain  cortex, lesions are rare in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Recently, however, several studies have demonstrated occult structural brain atrophy in NMO. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) abnormalities in patients with NMOSD and to assess the visual pathway integrity during disease duration correlation of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and pericalcarine cortex thickness. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with NMOSD and 34 matched healthy controls underwent both high-field MRI (3T) high-resolution T1-weighted and diffusion-tensor MRI. Voxel-based morphometry, cortical analyses (Freesurfer) and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) analyses (TBSS-FSL) were used to investigate brain abnormalities. In addition, RNFL measurement by optic-coherence tomography (OCT) was performed. RESULTS: We demonstrate that NMOSD is associated with GM and WM atrophy, encompassing more frequently the motor, sensory and visual pathways, and that the extent of GM atrophy correlates with disease duration. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time a correlation between RNFL and pericalcarine cortical thickness, with cortical atrophy evolving over the course of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a role for retrograde and anterograde neurodegeneration in GM atrophy in NMOSD. However, the presence atrophy encompassing almost all lobes suggests that additional pathomechanisms might also be involved.

N2  - Many studies have demonstrated that combining nerve conduits with neural stem cells  or growth factors can repair peripheral nerve injury in rodents. However, nerve damage does occur with longer gaps in human than in rodents, thus findings from rodent studies are difficult to translate to clinical practice. Minipigs have a longer gap that is more closely applicable to the challenge of human nerve grafting in extensive traumatic nerve damage. In this study, human amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs) and polylactate nerve conduits were used to repair sciatic nerve injury in minipigs. The AFSCs exhibited the properties of mesenchymal stem cells with a propensity toward neural stem cells. Measurements of compound muscle action potential implied that administration of conduits with AFSCs was beneficial in function recovery in the minipig model compared with conduits alone. The results of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) based fiber tractography assay in the minipig model suggest that combining AFSCs with conduits could expedite the repair of sciatic nerve injury. Further, MR-based DTI provides an effective and non-invasive method to visualize the sciatic nerve and to monitor the regeneration progress of injured nerve in a longitudinal study.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics as  biomarkers for the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in acute peripheral nerve injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four adult rats received subepineurial microinjection of MSCs (n = 22) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n = 22) 1 week after the sciatic nerve trunk crush injury. Sequential fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging, T2 measurement, DTI and sciatic nerve functional assessment were performed at a 3.0 Tesla MR unit over an 8-week follow-up, with histological assessments performed at regular intervals. The sciatic nerve function index, T2 value, and DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity values of the distal stumps of crushed nerves were measured and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Nerves treated with MSCs showed better functional recovery and exhibited more pronounced nerve regeneration compared with nerves treated with PBS. T2 values in nerves treated with MSCs or PBS showed a similar change pattern (P = 0.174), while FA and RD values in nerves treated with MSCs showed more rapid return (one week earlier) to baseline level than nerves treated with PBS (P = 0.045; 0.035). Nerves treated with MSCs had higher FA and lower RD values than nerves treated with PBS during the period from 2 to 3 weeks after surgery (P ≤ 0.0001, 0.004; P = 0.004, 0.006). CONCLUSION: FA and RD values derived from DTI might be used as sensitive biomarkers for detecting the therapeutic effect of stem cells in acute peripheral nerve crush injuries.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We analyzed whether radiographically demonstrated anterior inferior  cerebellar artery (AICA) vascular compression of the cochleovestibular nerve in asymmetric hearing loss could be correlated to either the symptomatic ear or to cochlear nerve diameter. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case-control study in which patients were enrolled into a database if audiometry demonstrated asymmetry of 20 dB at one frequency, asymmetry of 10 dB at two frequencies, or a difference of 20% on word recognition scores. If AICA vascular contact was demonstrated on subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the cerebellopontine angle, patients were included in the study. Patients with vestibular schwannoma or Meniere's disease were excluded. The AICA contact was graded by a blinded neuroradiologist according to criteria proposed by McDermott et al. The cross-sectional area of the cochlear nerve was measured. RESULTS: Symptomatic ears could be correlated to a decreased cochlear nerve diameter, but not to the degree of AICA penetration into the internal auditory canal. CONCLUSIONS: AICA vascular compression of the cochleovestibular nerve does not appear to correlate to hearing loss or to cochlear nerve diameter. The finding of decreased cochlear nerve diameter in symptomatic ears implies an alternative mechanism for asymmetric hearing loss.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and interobserver performance of  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and detect correlations with electrophysiology. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers (controls) and ten DPN patients were enrolled to undergo MR examinations. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of tibial nerve (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were measured. Unpaired t test and Levene tests were performed to assess differences between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for FA and ADC values. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between DTI and electrophysiology parameters in the patient group. RESULTS: The FA values of TN and CPN in the DPN group were significantly lower and ADC were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Interobserver agreement was excellent. FA positively correlated and ADC negatively correlated with motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between motor nerve conduction amplitude and DTI parameters (p > 0.05). Moderate diagnostic accuracy of DTI was seen in the diagnosis of DPN. CONCLUSIONS: DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy and excellent interobserver performance in the detection of DPN involving the TN and CPN. There is moderate correlation with MCV. KEY POINTS: • FA values of TN and CPN are significantly lower in DPN. • ADC values of TN and CPN are significantly higher in DPN. • DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy in detection of DPN. • There is excellent interobserver performance in DTI measurements. • Moderate correlation is seen between DTI parameters and MCV.

N2  - Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is hallmarked by degeneration of small unmyelinated  peripheral nerve fibers in the skin. Traditionally, it has been considered as a pure disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, previous work found that dysfunction of skin nerves led to abnormal recruitment of pain-related regions, suggesting that the brain may be affected in SFN. This report combined structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify structural and functional changes in the brain of 19 patients with SFN compared with 17 healthy controls. We applied tensor-based morphometry to detect brain structural alterations in SFN. Greater volume reduction in pain-processing regions, particularly the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices (ACCs), was associated with greater depletion of intraepidermal nerve fibers, a pathological biomarker of skin nerve degeneration. Based on the hypothesis that structural alterations in the pain-processing regions might impair their functional connectivity, we further applied psychophysiological interaction analysis to assess functional connectivity of the ACCs during noxious heat stimulation. There was significant reduction in functional connectivity from the ACCs to the limbic areas (the parahippocampal gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex), pain-processing area (the insula), and visuospatial areas (the cuneus). Moreover, the degree of reduction in functional connectivity for the ACC to the amygdala and the precuneus was linearly correlated with the severity of intraepidermal nerve fiber depletion. Our findings suggest that SFN is not a pure peripheral nervous system disorder. The pain-related brain networks tend to break into functionally independent components, with severity linked to the degree of skin nerve degeneration.

N2  - AIM: To visualize cranial nerves (CNs) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with  special parameters. This study also involved the evaluation of preoperative estimates and intraoperative confirmation of the relationship between nerves and tumor by verifying the accuracy of visualization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 3T magnetic resonance imaging scans including 3D-FSPGR, FIESTA, and DTI were used to collect information from 18 patients with skull base tumor. DTI data were integrated into the 3D slicer for fiber tracking and overlapped anatomic images to determine course of nerves. 3D reconstruction of tumors was achieved to perform neighboring, encasing, and invading relationship between lesion and nerves. RESULTS: Optic pathway including the optic chiasm could be traced in cases of tuberculum sellae meningioma and hypophysoma (pituitary tumor). The oculomotor nerve, from the interpeduncular fossa out of the brain stem to supraorbital fissure, was clearly visible in parasellar meningioma cases. Meanwhile, cisternal parts of trigeminal nerve and abducens nerve, facial nerve were also imaged well in vestibular schwannomas and petroclival meningioma cases. The 3D-spatial relationship between CNs and skull base tumor estimated preoperatively by tumor modeling and tractography corresponded to the results determined during surgery. CONCLUSION: Supported by DTI and 3D slicer, preoperative 3D reconstruction of most CNs related to skull base tumor is feasible in pathological circumstances. We consider DTI Technology to be a useful tool for predicting the course and location of most CNs, and syntopy between them and skull base tumor.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral nerves at the elbow region are prone to entrapment  neuropathies and injuries. To make accurate assessment, clinicians need stereoscopic display of the nerves to observe them at all angles. OBJECTIVES: To obtain a stereoscopic display of the peripheral nerves at the elbow region based on magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using three post-processing methods of volume rendering (VR), maximum intensity projection (MIP), and fiber tractography, and to evaluate the difference and correlation between them. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four elbows of 12 healthy young volunteers were assessed by 20 encoding diffusion direction MR DTI scans. Images belonging to a single direction (anterior-posterior direction, perpendicular to the nerve) were subjected to VR and MIP reconstruction. All raw DTI data were transferred to the Siemens MR workstation for fiber tractography post-processing. Imaging qualities of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were evaluated by two observers independently based on a custom evaluation scale. RESULTS: Stereoscopic displays of the nerves were obtained in all 24 elbows by VR, MIP, and fiber tractography post-processing methods. The VR/MIP post-processing methods were easier to perform compared to fiber tractography. There was no significant difference among the scores of fiber tracking and VR/MIP reconstruction for single direction. The imaging quality scores of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were significantly correlated based on intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis (ICC ranged 0.709 - 0.901), which suggested that the scores based on fiber tractography and VR/MIP for the same sample were consistent. Inter- and intraobserver agreements were good to excellent. CONCLUSION: Stereoscopic displays of the peripheral nerves at the elbow region can be achieved by using VR, MIP, and fiber tracking post-processing methods based on raw DTI images. VR and MIP reconstruction could be used as preview tools before fiber tracking to determine whether the raw images are satisfactory.

N2  - Piriformis muscle syndrome (PMS) is difficult to diagnose by objective evaluation of  sciatic nerve injury. Here we report a case of PMS diagnosed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of the sciatic nerve, which can assess and visualize the extent of nerve injury. The patient was a 53-year-old man with a 2-year history of continuous pain and numbness in the left leg. His symptoms worsened when sitting. Physical examination, including sensorimotor neurologic tests, the deep tendon reflex test, and the straight leg raise test, revealed no specific findings. The hip flexion adduction and internal rotation test and resisted contraction maneuvers for the piriformis muscle were positive. There were no abnormal findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine. The transverse diameter of piriformis muscle was slightly thicker in affected side on MRI of the pelvis. A single DTI sequence was performed during MRI of the pelvis. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the sciatic nerve were quantified at three levels using the fiber-tracking method. FA values were significantly lower and ADC values were significantly higher distal to the piriformis muscle. We performed endoscopic-assisted resection of the piriformis tendon. Intraoperatively, the motor-evoked potentials in the left gastrocnemius were improved by resection of the piriformis tendon. The patient's symptoms improved immediately after surgery. There was no significant difference in FA or ADC at any level between the affected side and the unaffected side 3 months postoperatively. MRI-DTI may aid the diagnosis of PMS.

N2  - AIMS: To evaluate the diagnostic value of non-nerve-selective MRI sequences in  posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathic pain (PTNP). METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed all MRI protocols performed between February 2, 2012 and June 20, 2018 commissioned by the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospitals Leuven. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic data were extracted from the records of patients with an MRI in the context of PTNP. A contingency table was constructed based on the opinions of the treating physician and the radiologist who initially evaluated the MRI. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 27 women (65.9%) and 14 men (34.1%). The sensitivity and negative predictive value of MRI in PTNP were 0.18 and 0.77, respectively. Artifacts interfered with visualization of a possible cause of the trigeminal pain in 24.4% of MRIs. Almost all artifacts (90%) were caused by metal debris originating from the causal procedure or posttraumatic surgeries. MRI resulted in changed management for PTNP patients only once. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic value of non-nerve-selective MRI sequences for PTNP is low and has little impact on clinical management. Therefore, there is a need for dedicated sequences with high resolution and low artifact susceptibility for visualizing the posttraumatic injuries of the trigeminal branches.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the significance of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and  whole body MRI (WB-MRI) in the diagnosis, prognosis and assessment of therapy for patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study includes 219 patients providing 463 WB-MRI and DCE-MRI investigations for the subgroups MGUS (n=70), MM active disease (n=126; this includes 70 patients with new diagnosis of MM, according to the International Staging System (ISS): 41.4% ISS stage I, 20.0% ISS stage II, 7.1% ISS stage III, 31.4% insufficient for staging; and 56 patients with '(re-)active disease': 16.07% relapse, 32.14% progressive disease and 51.79% stable disease) and MM remission (n=23; 60.87% complete remission, 17.39% very good partial remission and 21.74% partial remission). Investigations of patients with hereditary multiple exostoses (n=5), neurofibromatosis (n=7) and healthy persons (n=9) were added as control subjects (n=21). WB-MRI evaluation was done by evaluating thirteen skeletal regions, providing a 'skeletal score'. DCE-MRI images of the spine, were analyzed with regions-of-interest and time-intensity-curves (TIC). RESULTS: All TIC parameters can significantly differentiate between the predefined subgroups (p<0.001). One hundred days after autologous stem cell transplantation a 75% decrease of the slope wash-in value (p<0.001) can be seen. A cubic regression trend between 'skeletal score' and slope wash-in (adj.R(2)=0.412) could demonstrate a significant increase bone marrow perfusion if MM affects more than 10 skeletal regions (p<0.001), associated with a poorer prognosis (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: DCE-MRI evaluation of the spine is useful for diagnosis of MM, follow-up after stem cell transplantation and evaluation of disease activity. A combined evaluation with WB-MRI and DCE-MRI provides additional micro-vascular information on the morphologic lesions and could help categorize patients with MM in two different groups to offer useful therapeutic and prognostic advise.

N2  - In MR images, the median nerve of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients frequently  appears flatter than in healthy subjects. The purpose of this work was to develop a metric to quantify localized median nerve deformation rather than global nerve flattening, the hypothesis being that localized median nerve deformation would be elevated in CTS patients. Twelve patients with CTS and 12 matched normals underwent MRI scanning in eight isometrically loaded hand conditions. 2D cross sections of the proximal and distal tunnel were analyzed for nerve cross sectional area, flattening ratio, and a position shift to the dorsal side of the tunnel. Additionally, new metrics based on the angulation of the nerve perimeter in 0.5-mm lengths around the boundary were calculated. The localized deformation metrics were able to detect differences between CTS patients and healthy subjects that could not be appreciated from the flattening ratio. During most hand activities, normal subjects had a higher average percentage of locally deformed nerve boundary than did CTS patients, despite having a rounder overall shape. Less local nerve deformation in the CTS patient group resulting from its interaction with flexor tendons suggests that the nerve may be less compliant in CTS patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: During the surgery for a distal radius fracture, we encountered a large  anomalous muscle lying across the distal radius. The muscle was identified as a flexor carpi radialis brevis muscle (FCRB), based on its location, function, and innervation. This experience led us to clarify its prevalence in living subjects and alert surgeons of its presence. METHODS: We reviewed wrist MRI scans of 515 hands of 379 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The prevalence of the FCRB was calculated. The cross sectional area (CSA) of the FCRB was compared with that of the hypothenar muscles. Signal intensity and fat infiltration of the FCRB were assessed using semiquantitative methods. The anterior compartment ratio (CSA of the anterior compartment of the forearm was divided by CSA of the forearm. CSA of the FCRB was excluded for measurement) was compared between patients with and without FCRB. RESULTS: We found seven hands of six patients (1.6%) with a FCRB. All of these tendons were inserted into the second metacarpal base. CSA of FCRB was smaller than that of the hypothenar muscles. Semiquantitative assessment revealed normal signal intensities of the FCRB compared with those of other muscles. The anterior compartment ratio was smaller in patients with FCRB than without FCRB. None of the FCRB in our series demonstrated any sign of tendinitis on MRI. Furthermore, the postoperative clinical course for those patients was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of FCRB in patients with CTS was 1.6%. FCRB should function as a wrist flexor. Its strength varied according to the individuals but was not greater than that of the hypothenar muscles. It is still unclear if the FCRB could cause the development of CTS. However, it was found that the FCRB could be a mass which occupies and narrows the anterior compartment.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Using three-dimensional (3D) printing to create individualized patient  models of the skull base, the optic chiasm and facial nerve can be previsualized to help identify and protect these structures during tumor removal surgery. METHODS: Preoperative imaging data for 2 cases of sellar tumor and 1 case of acoustic neuroma were obtained. Based on these data, the cranial nerves were visualized using 3D T1-weighted turbo field echo sequence and diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking. Mimics software was used to create 3D reconstructions of the skull base regions surrounding the tumors, and 3D solid models were printed for use in simulation of the basic surgical steps. RESULTS: The 3D printed personalized skull base tumor solid models contained information regarding the skull, brain tissue, blood vessels, cranial nerves, tumors, and other associated structures. The sphenoid sinus anatomy, saddle area, and cerebellopontine angle region could be visually displayed, and the spatial relationship between the tumor and the cranial nerves and important blood vessels was clearly defined. The models allowed for simulation of the operation, prediction of operative details, and verification of accuracy of cranial nerve reconstruction during the operation. Questionnaire assessment showed that neurosurgeons highly valued the accuracy and usefulness of these skull base tumor models. CONCLUSIONS: 3D printed models of skull base tumors and nearby cranial nerves, by allowing for the surgical procedure to be simulated beforehand, facilitate preoperative planning and help prevent cranial nerve injury.

N2  - PURPOSE: To define the optimal acquisition parameters for diffusion tensor imaging  of the median nerve at the wrist and to measure the diffusion values. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The wrists of 14 healthy volunteers were explored using 3T MRI with a dedicated wrist coil. Each examination consisted of six sequences, varying the number of directions (15-20-30) and the b values (500-800-1000-2000s/mm(2)). The tractography images were evaluated by two radiologists using a qualitative scale with six levels. The diffusion and anisotropy coefficients (ADC and FA) were measured and the values compared with the data in the literature. RESULTS: Median nerve tractography was successfully achieved in all sequences. The 20 direction sequence with b=1000s/mm(2) seemed to provide the best results for a reasonable acquisition time (5'38″). The diffusion values showed large interindividual variations. CONCLUSION: Optimisation of acquisitions parameters is important in peripheral nerve tractography, and may facilitate a routine use of the technique. The images obtained are easy to analyse but the diffusivity and anisotropy coefficients are too variable, however, to be used in practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate different brain regions for grey (GM) and white matter  (WM) damage in a well-defined cohort of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients and compare advanced MRI techniques (VBM, Subcortical and cortical analyses (Freesurfer), and DTI) for their ability to detect damage in NMOSD. METHODS: We analyzed 21 NMOSD patients and 21 age and gender matched control subjects. VBM (GW/WM) and DTI whole brain (TBSS) analyses were performed at different statistical thresholds to reflect different statistical approaches in previous studies. In an automated atlas-based approach, Freesurfer and DTI results were compared between NMOSD and controls. RESULTS: DTI TBSS and DTI atlas based analysis demonstrated microstructural impairment only within the optic radiation or in regions associated with the optic radiation (posterior thalamic radiation p < 0.001, 6.9 % reduction of fractional anisotropy). VBM demonstrated widespread brain GM and WM reduction, but only at exploratory statistical thresholds, with no differences remaining after correction for multiple comparisons. Freesurfer analysis demonstrated no group differences. CONCLUSION: NMOSD specific parenchymal brain damage is predominantly located in the optic radiation, likely due to a secondary degeneration caused by ON. In comparison, DTI appears to be the most reliable and sensitive technique for brain damage detection in NMOSD. KEY POINTS: • The hypothesis of a widespread brain damage in NMOSD is challenged. • The optic radiation (OR) is the most severely affected region. • OR-affection is likely due to secondary degeneration following optic neuritis. • DTI is currently the most sensitive technique for NMOSD-related brain-damage detection. • DTI is currently the most reliable technique for NMOSD-related brain-damage detection.

N2  - We report on a patient with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) who was diagnosed with  conversion disorder for severe weakness of an arm, which was demonstrated using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A 23-year-old right-handed female suffered from head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident. She underwent rehabilitative management for memory impairment and central pain. At 14 months after onset, she complained of severe weakness of her right arm, which was detected in the morning after sleeping (right shoulder abductor: 3/5, elbow flexor: 3/5, wrist extensor: 1/5, finger flexor: 1/5, and finger extensor: 1/5). Electromyography study for peripheral neuropathy performed at 2 weeks after onset of weakness showed no abnormality. On a 14-month DTT configuration, the integrities of the left corticospinal tract (CST), supplementary motor area-corticofugal tract (SMA-CFT), and dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC)-CFT were well-preserved. Significant differences were not observed for the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and tract volume (TV) values of the CST, SMA-CFT, and dPMC-CFT in both hemispheres between the patient and ten right-handed age- and sex-matched normal subjects (p > 0.05). On a 14-month TMS study, MEPs obtained at the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle showed no abnormality. Using DTT and TMS, conversion disorder was demonstrated in a patient with mild TBI, who showed severe weakness of an arm. Our results suggest the usefulness of an evaluation of the CST and CFTs from the secondary motor areas using DTT, and the CST using TMS for patients who complain of motor weakness due to conversion disorder.

N2  - Perineuroma, rare in children, presents as a painless mononeuropathy of a major  nerve trunk. Resection of the lesion with end-to-end sural nerve grafting appears to be the treatment of choice. This technique is not recommended if the unhealthy segment of nerve is too long or if spinal roots are involved. However, in children, reports of direct MR evaluation of nerve trunks and of the exiting nerve roots are limited. We report a 7-year-old girl with an intramural sciatic nerve perineuroma in whom the diagnosis was made by MRI and confirmed by biopsy. The MR protocol combining 3-D T2-W STIR SPACE, fat-saturated gadolinium-enhanced T1-W images, and diffusion tensor imaging with tractography was a valuable tool for depicting peripheral nerve and roots in order to plan surgical treatment.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN: In patients with sciatica or neurogenic claudication, the structures  in and adjacent to the lumbar spinal canal were observed by computed tomographic myelography or magnetic resonance imaging in psoas-relaxed position and during axial compression in slight extension of the lumbar spine. OBJECTIVES: To determine the mechanical effects on the lumbar spinal canal in a simulated upright position. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: For years, functional myelographic investigation techniques were shown to be of value in the evaluation of suspected encroachment of the spinal canal. Since the advent of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, there have been few clinical and experimental attempts that have imitated these techniques. The data indicate that the space within the canal is posture dependent. METHODS: Portable devices for axial loading of the lumbar spine in computed tomographic and magnetic resonance examinations were developed. Fifty patients (94 sites) were studied with computed tomographic myelography, and 34 patients (80 sites) with magnetic resonance in psoas-relaxed position followed by axial compression in slight extension. The dural sac cross-sectional area at L2 to S1, the deformation of the dural sac and the nerve roots, and the changes of the tissues surrounding the canal were observed. RESULTS: In 66 of the investigated 84 patients, there was a statistically significant reduction of the dural sac cross-sectional area in at least one site during axial compression in slight extension. Of the investigated patients, 29 passed the borderlines for relative (100 mm2) or absolute stenosis (75 mm2) in 40 sites. In 30 patients, there was deformation of the dural sac in 46 sites. In 11 of the patients investigated with magnetic resonance imaging, there was a narrowing of the lateral recess in 13 sites, during axial compression in slight extension. CONCLUSIONS: Axial loading of the lumbar spine in computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging is recommended in patients with sciatica or neurogenic claudication when the dural sac cross-sectional area at any disc location is below 130 mm2 in conventional psoas-relaxed position and when there is a suspected narrowing of the dural sac or the nerve roots, especially in the ventrolateral part of the spinal canal in psoas-relaxed position. The diagnostic specificity of the spinal stenosis will increase considerably when the patient is subjected to an axial load.

N2  - Rationale: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a great challenge for regenerative  medicine. Nerve autograft is the gold standard for clinical PNI repair. Due to its significant drawbacks, artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) have drawn much attention as replacement therapies. We developed a combinatorial NGC consisting of longitudinally aligned electrospun nanofibers and porcine decellularized nerve matrix hydrogel (pDNM gel). The in vivo capacity for facilitating nerve tissue regeneration and functional recovery was evaluated in a rat sciatic nerve defect model. Methods: Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) was electrospun into randomly oriented (PLLA-random) and longitudinally aligned (PLLA-aligned) nanofibers. PLLA-aligned were further coated with pDNM gel at concentrations of 0.25% (PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel) and 1% (PLLA-aligned/1% pDNM gel). Axonal extension and Schwann cells migration were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining of dorsal root ganglia cultured on the scaffolds. To fabricate implantable NGCs, the nanofibrous scaffolds were rolled and covered with an electrospun protection tube. The fabricated NGCs were then implanted into a 5 mm sciatic nerve defect model in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Nerves treated with NGCs were compared to contralateral uninjured nerves (control group), injured but untreated nerves (unstitched group), and autografted nerves. Nerve regeneration was monitored by an established set of assays, including T2 values and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histological assessments, and immunostaining. Nerve functional recovery was evaluated by walking track analysis. Results: PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel scaffold exhibited the best performance in facilitating directed axonal extension and Schwann cells migration in vitro due to the combined effects of the topological cues provided by the aligned nanofibers and the biochemical cues retained in the pDNM gel. Consistent results were obtained in animal experiments with the fabricated NGCs. Both the T2 and fractional anisotropy values of the PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel group were the closest to those of the autografted group, and returned to normal much faster than those of the other NGCs groups. Histological assessment indicated that the implanted PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel NGC resulted in the largest number of axons and the most extensive myelination among all fabricated NGCs. Further, the PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel group exhibited the highest sciatic nerve function index, which was comparable to that of the autografted group, at 8 weeks post-surgery. Conclusions: NGCs composed of aligned PLLA nanofibers decorated with 0.25% pDNM gel provided both topological and biochemical guidance for directing and promoting axonal extension, nerve fiber myelination, and functional recovery. Moreover, T2-mapping and DTI metrics were found to be useful non-invasive monitoring techniques for PNI treatment.

N2  - Imaging of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has demonstrated key diffusion tensor  imaging-based diffusivity alterations in the trigeminal nerve; however, imaging has primarily focused on the peripheral nerve segment because of previous limitations in reliably segmenting small fiber bundles across multiple subjects. We used Selective Automated Group Integrated Tractography to study 36 subjects with TN (right-sided pain) and 36 sex-matched controls to examine the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve [CN V]), pontine decussation (TPT), and thalamocortical fibers (S1). Gaussian process classifiers were trained by scrolling a moving window over CN V, TPT, and S1 tractography centroids. Fractional anisotropy (FA), generalized FA, radial diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity metrics were evaluated for both groups, analyzing TN vs control groups and affected vs unaffected sides. Classifiers that performed at greater-than-or-equal-to 70% accuracy were included. Gaussian process classifier consistently demonstrated bilateral trigeminal changes, differentiating them from controls with an accuracy of 80%. Affected and unaffected sides could be differentiated from each other with 75% accuracy. Bilateral TPT could be distinguished from controls with at least 85% accuracy. TPT left-right classification achieved 98% accuracy. Bilateral S1 could be differentiated from controls, where the affected S1 radial diffusivity classifier achieved 87% accuracy. This is the first TN study that combines group-wise merged tractography, machine learning classification, and analysis of the complete trigeminal pathways from the peripheral fibers to S1 cortex. This analysis demonstrates that TN is characterized by bilateral abnormalities throughout the trigeminal pathway compared with controls and abnormalities between affected and unaffected sides. This full pathway tractography study of TN demonstrates bilateral changes throughout the trigeminal pathway and changes between affected and unaffected sides.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Decompression surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the most  performed spine surgery procedure in patients older than 65 years. Around 40% of LSS patients scheduled for decompression surgery have evidence of redundant nerve roots (RNR) of the cauda equina on their magnetic resonance images (MRI). Little is known about the clinical significance of RNR in LSS patients. The objective was to assess the effects of RNR on clinical scores and recovery in older adults diagnosed with LSS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in April 2018 on PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Prospective and retrospective cohort studies undertaken to assess differences in clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with LSS with versus without evidence of RNR on their MRIs were selected. Two authors independently selected studies, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous variables and odds ratio (OR) for variables reported in frequencies. RESULTS: Seven studies comprising a total of 1046 LSS patients were included in the meta-analysis. LSS patients with evidence of RNR (RNR+) were older, WMD 5.7 95% CI [2.2-9.2], p = 0.001, had smaller cross sectional area (CSA) of the stenotic level, WMD -12.2 95% CI [-17.7 to -6.7], p < 0.0001 and longer symptom onset duration, WMD 13.2 95% CI [-0.2-26.7], p = 0.05. The pooled preoperative clinical score in the RNR + group was worse but the difference was not statistically significant, WMD -3.8 95% CI [-7.9 to 0.2], p = 0.07. After decompression surgery RNR + patients had worse clinical scores, -4.7 95% CI [-7.3 to -2.1], p = 0.0004 and lower recovery rates, -9.8 95% CI [-14.8 to -4.7], p = 0.0001. CONCLUSION: There is limited quality evidence that RNR + patients are older, have a longer symptom history and present higher degrees of lumbar stenosis as given by the narrow CSA in comparison to RNR- patients. After decompression surgery RNR + patients have worse clinical scores and lower recovery rates. In view of these results RNR can be seen as a negative prognostic factor in LSS patients.

N2  - OBJECTIVE Preoperative determination of the facial nerve (FN) course is essential to  preserving its function. Neither regular preoperative imaging examination nor intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring is able to determine the exact position of the FN. The diffusion tensor imaging-based fiber tracking (DTI-FT) technique has been widely used for the preoperative noninvasive visualization of the neural fasciculus in the white matter of brain. However, further studies are required to establish its role in the preoperative visualization of the FN in acoustic neuroma surgery. The object of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using DTI-FT to visualize the FN. METHODS Data from 15 patients with acoustic neuromas were collected using 3-T MRI. The visualized FN course and its position relative to the tumors were determined using DTI-FT with 3D Slicer software. The preoperative visualization results of FN tracking were verified using microscopic observation and electrophysiological monitoring during microsurgery. RESULTS Preoperative visualization of the FN using DTI-FT was observed in 93.3% of the patients. However, in 92.9% of the patients, the FN visualization results were consistent with the actual surgery. CONCLUSIONS DTI-FT, in combination with intraoperative FN electrophysiological monitoring, demonstrated improved FN preservation in patients with acoustic neuroma. FN visualization mainly included the facial-vestibular nerve complex of the FN and vestibular nerve.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of the association between chronic demyelinating  inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) and central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating lesions is probably underestimated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of combined central and peripheral demyelination in CIDP patients and to correlate visual evoked potential (VEP) abnormalities with CNS demyelinating lesions, observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and antibodies against glycolipids. METHODS: Nerve conduction studies, brain MRI and antibodies against glycolipids were prospectively studied in 17 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria proposed for CIDP (Cornblath DR, Asbury AK, Albers JW, Feasby TE, Hahn AF, McLeod JG, Mendell JR, Parry GJ, Pollard JD, Thomas PK. Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task Force. Research criteria for diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Neurology, 1991;41:617-618). VEPs were performed in each case before and after 6 months treatment with either intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or steroids. RESULTS: Eight patients (47%) had increased latencies in at least one eye or showed increased interocular latency difference. Four patients (23%) presented a significant high signal intensity on T2-weighted brain MRI images. Of these 4 patients, 3 had prolonged VEP latency. Two patients with delayed VEP latency had antibodies against GM1, and SGLPG and anti-sulfatides, respectively. One patient with normal VEPs also had antibodies to GM1. VEP results were not significantly modified after treatment, either with steroids or IVIG. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the high frequency of abnormal VEPs in CIDP patients, and found that they are poorly correlated with CNS demyelinating lesions and antibodies against glycolipids. The VEP abnormalities of these patients may be explained by the susceptibility to immune-mediated damage of both the peripheral nervous system and the optic nerve.

N2  - OBJECT Visual field defects (VFDs) due to optic radiation (OR) injury are a common  complication of temporal lobe surgery. The authors analyzed whether preoperative visualization of the optic tract would reduce this complication by influencing the surgeon's decisions about surgical approaches. The authors also determined whether white matter shifts caused by temporal lobe tumors would follow predetermined patterns based on the tumor's topography. METHODS One hundred thirteen patients with intraaxial tumors of the temporal lobe underwent preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber tracking. In 54 of those patients, both pre- and postoperative VFDs were documented using computerized perimetry. Brainlab's iPlan 2.5 navigation software was used for tumor reconstruction and fiber visualization after the fusion of DTI studies with their respective magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) images. The tracking algorithm was as follows: minimum fiber length 100 mm, fractional anisotropy threshold 0.1. The lateral geniculate body and the calcarine cortex were employed as tract seeding points. Shifts of the OR caused by tumor were visualized in comparison with the fiber tracking of the patient's healthy hemisphere. RESULTS Temporal tumors produced a dislocation of the OR but no apparent fiber destruction. The shift of white matter tracts followed fixed patterns dependent on tumor location: Temporolateral tumors resulted in a medial fiber shift, and thus a lateral transcortical approach is recommended. Temporopolar tumors led to a posterior shift, always including Meyer's loop; therefore, a pterional transcortical approach is recommended. Temporomesial tumors produced a lateral and superior shift; thus, a transsylvian-transcisternal approach will result in maximum sparing of the fibers. Temporocentric tumors also induced a lateral fiber shift. For those tumors, a transsylvian-transopercular approach is recommended. Tumors of the fusiform gyrus generated a superior (and lateral) shift; consequently, a subtemporal approach is recommended to avoid white matter injury. In applying the approaches recommended above, new or worsened VFDs occurred in 4% of the patient cohort. Total neurological and surgical morbidity were less than 10%. In 90% of patients, gross-total resection was accomplished. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative visualization of the OR may help in avoiding postoperative VFDs.

N2  - PURPOSE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the leading cause of  death for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Identification of hypermetabolic lesions on PET may help identify patients at risk for MPNST. The objective of this study was to identify clinical and MRI-derived variables that predicted increased metabolic activity of neurofibromas in NF1 patients as determined by PET. METHODS: This prospective study included NF1 patients with neurofibromas of 5 cm in diameter or greater. All patients underwent whole-body MRI and F-FDG PET imaging. Tumor volume was calculated from the MR scans using a semiautomated 3-dimensional segmentation method. SUVmax's were calculated to quantify metabolic activity. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship among SUVmax, tumor volume, location (extremity vs trunk), type (plexiform vs circumscribed), depth (superficial vs deep), patient age, and whole-body tumor burden. RESULTS: A total of 311 neurofibromas were identified in 19 NF1 patients (mean age, 38 years; range, 19-58 years). One extreme outlier was excluded from analysis. Whole-body tumor volumes ranged from 0.4 to 1182.4 mL. Fifty of 310 tumors were FDG-avid on PET (16%) with median SUVmax of 2.2 (range, 0.4-9.6). Metabolic activity (SUVmax >2.5) correlated with tumor location (deep > superficial, trunk > extremity) in tumors with PET avidity. CONCLUSIONS: In NF1 patients with neurofibromas of 5 cm or greater, the majority of internal tumors are not metabolically active on PET. Tumors with increased metabolic activity as defined by SUVmax greater than 2.5 (ie, suggestive of MPNST) are more likely to be deep and located within the trunk.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between  microstructural nerve roots changes on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and clinical symptoms and their duration in patients with lumbar disc herniation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The ability to identify microstructural properties of the nervous system with DTI has been demonstrated in many studies. However, there are no data regarding the association between microstructural changes evaluated using DTI and symptoms assessed with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and their duration. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with foraminal disc herniation affecting unilateral sacral 1 (S1) nerve roots were enrolled in this study. DTI with tractography was performed on the S1 nerve roots. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using an ODI questionnaire for each patient, and the duration of clinical symptoms was noted based on the earliest instance of leg pain and numbness. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated from tractography images. RESULTS: The mean FA value of the compressed lumbar nerve roots was significantly lower than the FA of the contralateral nerve roots (P < 0.001). No notable difference in ADC was observed between compressed nerve roots and contralateral nerve roots (P = 0.517). In the compressed nerve roots, a significant negative association was observed between FA values and ODI and symptom duration. However, an obvious positive association was observed between ODI and ADC values and duration on the compressed side. CONCLUSION: Significant changes in diffusion parameters were found in the compressed sacral nerves in patients with lumbar disc herniation and leg pain, indicating that the microstructure of the nerve root has been damaged. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case-control study of multifidus muscle atrophy in 39  patients with unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy and lumbosacral disc herniation and 20 controls. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate quantitatively the asymmetry of multifidus muscles in unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy with disc herniation (herniated intervertebral disc; HIVD) by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Histologic and morphologic changes of multifidus muscles have been reported in lumbosacral disc herniation, but there are few imaging studies on the changes of multifidus muscles in unilateral radiculopathy. METHODS: Bilateral multifidus muscles in L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 levels were detected in fast spin-echo T1 axial MRI images. The total cross-sectional area (CSA) of multifidus muscles (TMA) and the density of pure muscle CSA (PMA) were measured by a computerized analysis program, and the ratios of PMA to TMA (PMA/TMA) and the PMA ratios of involved to uninvolved sides (IMA/UMA) were calculated. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the electrodiagnosis results: a radiculopathy (RAD) group and an HIVD group without definite radiculopathy. RESULTS: Fourteen patients had lumbosacral radiculopathies (RAD group) while 25 had no radiculopathy (HIVD group). No significant difference was found between the RAD and HIVD groups in TMA, PMA, and PMA/TMA. In terms of the criteria for the upper limit of IMA/UMA, 78.6% in the RAD group had an abnormal IMA/UMA ratio in at least 1 level, compared with 24% in the HIVD group and 10% in the control group. Thus, more cases with less muscle volume in the involved side were seen in the RAD group than in the HIVD and control groups. CONCLUSION: Asymmetry of the multifidus muscles as seen in MRI was a useful finding to assess patients who had unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy with HIVD. This may reflect the denervation of multifidus muscles in lumbosacral radiculopathy.

N2  - PURPOSE: The speed limit for three-dimensional Fourier-encoded steady state free  precession (SSFP) imaging is explored on a clinical whole body system and pushed toward a pulse repetition time (TR) close to or even below the 1 ms regime; in the following referred to as ultra-fast SSFP imaging. METHODS: To this end, contemporary optimization strategies, such as efficient gradient switching patterns, partial echoes, ramp sampling techniques, and a target-related design of excitation pulses were applied to explore the lower boundaries in TR for SSFP-based Cartesian imaging. RESULTS: Generally, minimal TR was limited in vivo by peripheral nerve stimulation, allowing a TR ∼1 ms for isotropic resolutions down to about 2 mm. As a result, ultra-fast balanced SSFP provides artifact-free images even for targets with severe susceptibility variations, and native high-resolution structural and functional in vivo (1)H imaging of the human lung is demonstrated at 1.5 T. CONCLUSION: On clinical whole body MRI systems, the TR of SSFP-based Cartesian imaging can be pushed toward the 1 ms regime. As a result, ultra-fast SSFP protocols might represent a promising new powerful approach for SSFP-based imaging, not only for lung but also in a variety of clinical and scientific applications.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common median nerve entrapment  neuropathy characterized by pain, paresthesias, diminished peripheral nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and maladaptive functional brain neuroplasticity. We evaluated structural reorganization in brain gray (GM) and white (WM) matter and whether such plasticity is linked to altered median nerve function in CTS. METHODS: We performed NCV testing, T1-weighted structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 28 CTS and 28 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) contrasted regional GM volume for CTS versus HC. Significant clusters were correlated with clinical metrics and served as seeds to define associated WM tracts using DTI data and probabilistic tractography. Within these WM tracts, fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity were evaluated for group differences and correlations with clinical metrics. RESULTS: For CTS subjects, GM volume was significantly reduced in contralesional S1 (hand-area), pulvinar and frontal pole. GM volume in contralesional S1 correlated with median NCV. NCV was also correlated with RD and was negatively correlated with FA within U-fiber cortico-cortical association tracts identified from the contralesional S1 VBM seed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified clear morphometric changes in the CTS brain. This central morphometric change is likely secondary to peripheral nerve pathology and altered somatosensory afference. Enhanced axonal coherence and myelination within cortico-cortical tracts connecting primary somatosensory and motor areas may accompany peripheral nerve deafferentation. As structural plasticity was correlated with NCV and not symptomatology, the former may be a better determinant of appropriate clinical intervention for CTS, including surgery.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the correlation between age and the fractional  anisotropy (FA) values of peripheral nerves in healthy adults and compared the age-corrected FA values of peripheral nerves in healthy subjects and patients with polyneuropathy. METHODS: The institutional review board approved this study and informed consent was obtained from all participants before entry into the study. We optimized diffusion tensor imaging using a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner and an extremity coil for scanning tibial nerves. The effect of age and sex on the FA values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers was investigated and the age-corrected FA values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers and patients with polyneuropathy were compared. RESULTS: The maximum FA values of the tibial nerves remained constant until age 45 (approximately 0.516); they subsequently decreased by 0.004/year in healthy volunteers. After removing the effect of age with an age-adjusted equation, the median maximum FA values in the volunteers and patients were 0.518 (range, 0.406-0.616) and 0.442 (range, 0.376-0.530), respectively. The age-corrected FA values were significantly lower in the patients than the healthy volunteers (p < 0.001). There was no significant gender-related difference in the maximum FA values of the tibial nerves (p = 0.416). CONCLUSION: The age-corrected FA value of the peripheral nerves helps to differentiate between age-related peripheral nerve degeneration and polyneuropathies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a bedside test with ultrasonography for evaluation of foot  muscle atrophy in diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thickness and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle (EDB) and of the muscles of the first interstitium (MILs) were determined in 26 diabetic patients and in 26 matched control subjects using ultrasonography. To estimate the validity, findings were related to the total volume of all foot muscles determined at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-FM(vol)). Furthermore, the relations of ultrasonographic estimates to nerve conduction, sensory perception thresholds, and clinical condition were established. RESULTS: In diabetic patients, the ultrasonographic thickness of EDB (U-EDB(t)) was (means +/- SD) 6.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 9.0 +/- 1.0 mm in control subjects (P < 0.001), the thickness of MIL (U-MIL(t)) was 29.6 +/- 8.3 vs. 40.2 +/- 3.6 mm in control subjects (P < 0.001), and the CSA of EDB (U-EDB(CSA)) was 116 +/- 65 vs. 214 +/- 38 mm(2) in control subjects (P < 0.001). The MRI-FM(vol) was directly related to U-EDB(t) (r = 0.77), U-MIL(t) (r = 0.71), and U-EDB(CSA) (r = 0.74). U-EDB(t) and U-MIL(t) were thinner in neuropathic than in nonneuropathic diabetic patients (5.8 +/- 2.1 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.7 mm [P < 0.05] and 28.3 +/- 8.8 vs. 35.6 +/- 4.3 mm [P < 0.03], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Atrophy of intrinsic foot muscles determined at ultrasonography is directly related to foot muscle volume determined by MRI and to various measures of diabetic neuropathy. Ultrasonography seems to be useful for detection of foot muscle atrophy in diabetes.

N2  - Augmented reality could help the identification of nerve structures in brachial  plexus surgery. The goal of this study was to determine which law of mechanical behavior was more adapted by comparing the results of Hooke's isotropic linear elastic law to those of Ogden's isotropic hyperelastic law, applied to a biomechanical model of the brachial plexus. A model of finite elements was created using the ABAQUS(®) from a 3D model of the brachial plexus acquired by segmentation and meshing of MRI images at 0°, 45° and 135° of shoulder abduction of a healthy subject. The offset between the reconstructed model and the deformed model was evaluated quantitatively by the Hausdorff distance and qualitatively by the identification of 3 anatomical landmarks. In every case the Hausdorff distance was shorter with Ogden's law compared to Hooke's law. On a qualitative aspect, the model deformed by Ogden's law followed the concavity of the reconstructed model whereas the model deformed by Hooke's law remained convex. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the behavior of Ogden's isotropic hyperelastic mechanical model was more adapted to the modeling of the deformations of the brachial plexus.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study using a newly developed imaging diagnosis method  to examine the patients with L5 radiculopathy. OBJECTIVE: To confirm the efficacy of a new 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) imaging method to diagnose extraforaminal stenosis at the lumbosacral junction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The lack of recognition of extraforaminal stenosis at the lumbosacral junction is a cause of failed back surgery syndrome. A clear method to diagnose this condition is essential. METHODS: The participants were 75 consecutive patients (mean age 69.5 y) with or without cauda equina symptoms who were treated by microendoscopic spinal surgery for L5 radiculopathy. The lesion responsible for the symptoms was identified by a combination of neurologic findings, selective radiculography, (3D MRI), and intraoperative neurophysiological findings. Multislice CT scanning was carried out preoperatively from the L1 vertebral body to the sacrum in all patients. The CT scan images were transferred to a remote computer workstation, and the reconstructed images were examined after surgery by an investigator blinded to the clinical diagnoses. In the reconstructed plane, we measured the minimum cross-sectional area of the de novo bony tunnel formed by the L5 transverse process, sacral ala, and L5 vertebral body, that is, lumbosacral bony tunnel (LSBT) and determined a cutoff value to diagnose extraforaminal stenosis. The shape of the LSBT was also evaluated in relation to the diagnosis. RESULTS: In 3D CT analysis, the LSBT was found on the ipsilateral side in 51 of the 75 patients. The bony tunnel was outside the foramen in all patients diagnosed clinically with extraforaminal stenosis, but in only 60% of the patients without extraforaminal stenosis. The minimum cross-sectional area of the bony tunnel was significantly smaller in patients with an extraforaminal stenosis than in those without extraforaminal stenosis. The cutoff value was set at 0.8 cm2. The cross-sectional area was <0.8 cm2 in all patients with extraforaminal stenosis. The specificity of this diagnostic procedure was 89.6%, and the sensitivity was 100%. All true-positive cases had the spur-type shape of the bony tunnel, and all false-positive cases had the round-type shape. CONCLUSIONS: All patients with extraforaminal stenosis had an LSBT. The minimum cross-sectional area of the bony tunnel was significantly smaller in patients with an extraforaminal lesion than in those without an extraforaminal lesion. 3D CT is a useful tool for diagnosing extraforaminal stenosis at the lumbosacral junction.

N2  - Seventeen benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors were studied using MR. In all cases  T2 relaxation time, signal intensity on T1-weighted images (lesion/muscle ratio), detectability of nerve of origin, nerve-lesion relationship, and presence of a capsule were assessed. Sixteen tumors showed marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted images with T2 relaxation times values greater than 95 ms. One schwannoma was almost isointense with fat (T2 60 ms). All lesions were isointense with muscle on T1-weighted images. In schwannomas the nerve was usually situated at the periphery of the lesion and only in one case was it obliterated by the mass. In neurofibromas the nerve was either visible in a central position within the mass (two cases) or no longer visible (five cases). A capsule could be detected in 70% of the schwannomas and in 30% of the neurofibromas. In patients with soft tissue masses, MR may contribute to recognition of nerve sheath tumors by showing the nerve of origin and typical signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. It can also be helpful in distinguishing between schwannomas and neurofibromas by the location of the nerve of origin and the presence of a capsule.

N2  - Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) has been traditionally considered as a pure disorder of  the peripheral nervous system, characterized by neuropathic pain and degeneration of small-diameter nerve fibers in the skin. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed abnormal activations of pain networks, but the structural basis underlying such maladaptive functional alterations remains elusive. We applied diffusion tensor imaging to explore the influences of SFN on brain microstructures. Forty-one patients with pathology-proven SFN with reduced skin innervation were recruited. White matter connectivity with the thalamus as the seed was assessed using probabilistic tractography of diffusion tensor imaging. Patients with SFN had reduced thalamic connectivity with the insular cortex and the sensorimotor areas, including the postcentral and precentral gyri. Furthermore, the degree of skin nerve degeneration, measured by intraepidermal nerve fiber density, was associated with the reduction of connectivity between the thalamus and pain-related areas according to different neuropathic pain phenotypes, specifically, the frontal, cingulate, motor, and limbic areas for burning, electrical shocks, tingling, mechanical allodynia, and numbness. Despite altered white matter connectivity, there was no change in white matter integrity assessed with fractional anisotropy. Our findings indicate that alterations in structural connectivity may serve as a biomarker of maladaptive brain plasticity that contributes to neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve degeneration.

N2  - Ischemic stroke affects over 15 million patients per year and is a leading cause of  death worldwide. Currently available treatments are indicated for less than 5% of patients. Stimulation of the facial nerve has been proposed as a possible new treatment of ischemic stroke that acts by increasing blood flow to the brain and thereby restoring perfusion through collateral vessels. The objective of this project was to evaluate the changes in brain perfusion, following facial nerve stimulation in an animal stroke model using MRI measures of cerebral blood flow. Autologous blood clot was injected in the internal carotid artery to occlude the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 17 mongrel dogs. Occlusion in the MCA was verified using fluoroscopy and MRI angiography. Following baseline and post-stroke MRI images, the facial nerve at the site of the geniculate ganglion was located and then stimulated using a transcranial magnetic stimulator and a neuro-navigation system in 11 animals. Six animals followed the same procedure but were not stimulated (control group). The perfusion index of both sides of the brain was measured using gadolinium contrast MRI before and after stroke, and at 30 minute intervals after stimulation. Results show a significant and persistent increase in perfusion in the stroke side of the brain relative to the non-stroke / contralateral side, after stimulation, when compared to the control group. These results strongly support the future development and evaluation of a non-invasive facial nerve stimulator device for the early treatment of ischemic stroke.

N2  - In this study we described a case of lipofibromatous hamartoma involving the median  nerve. We adopted diffusion tensor imaging and constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography to reconstruct the affected median nerve. Moreover, we extracted diffusion-based parameters reflecting axonal integrity loss of median nerve fibres. Our data showed that constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography outperformed the diffusion tensor imaging-based method, allowing the detection of the entire median nerve, including its branches, thus offering a robust method to investigate the involvement of the median nerve in pathological conditions. All clinical and technical implications are extensively described.

N2  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In addition to nephropathy, retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy,  a microvascular complication of type 1 diabetes that may be tentatively referred to as 'diabetic encephalopathy' has gained increasing attention. There is growing evidence that lowered cognitive performance in patients with type 1 diabetes is related to chronic hyperglycaemia rather than recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, as previously speculated. The aim of our study was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to establish whether long-term hyperglycaemia, resulting in advanced retinopathy, contributes to structural changes in the brain (reduced grey matter). SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied voxel-based morphometry on magnetic resonance images to compare grey matter density (GMD) between three groups of participants. GMD is used as a marker of cortical atrophy. We compared 13 type 1 diabetic patients with a microvascular complication (i.e. proliferative retinopathy) with 18 type 1 diabetic patients who did not have retinopathy in order to assess the effects of microvascular changes on GMD. Both patient groups were compared with 21 healthy control subjects to assess the effect of diabetes in itself. RESULTS: Patients with diabetic retinopathy showed reduced GMD in the right inferior frontal gyrus and right occipital lobe compared both with patients without retinopathy and with healthy controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data show that patients with type 1 diabetes, who, as a consequence of chronic hyperglycaemia, had developed advanced retinopathy, also showed increased focal cortical atrophy on brain MRI.

N2  - Macrodystrophia lipomatosa, a hamartomatous enlargement of soft tissues leading to  gigantism of a part or a whole extremity, generally affects the territory of distribution of a single nerve. In some cases, this condition may cause an entrapment neuropathy. We report the clinical, radiological, and surgical findings of a patient with isolated non-syndromic macrodactyly and giant median nerve presenting recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In this case, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) supported the presence of fibrohamartomatous infiltration, determining an enlargement of the median nerve and consequently an increased susceptibility to compression damage. A 57-year-old man presenting macrodactyly of the second and third finger of the right hand showed recent onset of severe hypoesthesia of the first three fingers of the right hand. He also underwent surgery for right CTS 23 years before. The electromyography/electroneurography confirmed the diagnosis of CTS. The ultrasonography showed a massive enlargement of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel, while MRI confirmed the enlargement of the median nerve with thickened hypointense bundles and interposed tissue, with increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy at DTI. We discuss about the use of a relatively novel imaging technique, investigating for the first time an uncommon cause of a very common entrapment neuropathy.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: We investigated the changes in MRI T2 mapping values in subjects with  carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) compared to healthy controls. METHODS: We enrolled 71 patients with CTS and 26 healthy controls. Median nerve T2 values were measured at the distal carpal tunnel, hamate bone, proximal carpal tunnel, and forearm levels. These were compared between patients and controls and correlated with median nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) and nerve conduction measurements. RESULTS: The mean T2 values at the proximal carpal tunnel levels were higher in the CTS group (56.7 ms) than in the control group (51.2 ms, P = .02) and also were higher than at the distal carpal tunnel (51.0 ms, P < .001) and forearm levels (47.6 ms, P < .001). T2 values were not significantly associated with CSA or nerve conduction measurements. DISCUSSION: T2 mapping of the carpal tunnel provides qualitative information on median nerve pathology but does not reflect CTS severity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: . Despite modern antiretroviral therapy, HIV-associated neuropathy is one  of the most prevalent, disabling and treatment-resistant complications of HIV disease. The presence and intensity of distal neuropathic pain is not fully explained by the degree of peripheral nerve damage. A better understanding of brain structure in HIV distal neuropathic pain may help explain why some patients with HIV neuropathy report pain while the majority does not. Previously, we reported that more intense distal neuropathic pain was associated with smaller total cerebral cortical gray matter volumes. The objective of this study was to determine which parts of the cortex are smaller. METHODS: . HIV positive individuals with and without distal neuropathic pain enrolled in the multisite (N = 233) CNS HIV Antiretroviral Treatment Effects (CHARTER) study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate regional brain volumes in these structural brain images. RESULTS: . Left ventral posterior cingulate cortex was smaller for HIV positive individuals with versus without distal neuropathic pain (peak P  = 0.017; peak t = 5.15; MNI coordinates x = -6, y = -54, z = 20). Regional brain volumes within cortical gray matter structures typically associated with pain processing were also smaller for HIV positive individuals having higher intensity ratings of distal neuropathic pain. CONCLUSIONS: . The posterior cingulate is thought to be involved in inhibiting the perception of painful stimuli. Mechanistically a smaller posterior cingulate cortex structure may be related to reduced anti-nociception contributing to increased distal neuropathic pain.

N2  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in the spinal subarachnoid space (SSS) have been  thought to play an important pathophysiological role in syringomyelia, Chiari I malformation (CM), and a role in intrathecal drug delivery. Yet, the impact that fine anatomical structures, including nerve roots and denticulate ligaments (NRDL), have on SSS CSF dynamics is not clear. In the present study we assessed the impact of NRDL on CSF dynamics in the cervical SSS. The 3D geometry of the cervical SSS was reconstructed based on manual segmentation of MRI images of a healthy volunteer and a patient with CM. Idealized NRDL were designed and added to each of the geometries based on in vivo measurments in the literature and confirmation by a neuroanatomist. CFD simulations were performed for the healthy and patient case with and without NRDL included. Our results showed that the NRDL had an important impact on CSF dynamics in terms of velocity field and flow patterns. However, pressure distribution was not altered greatly although the NRDL cases required a larger pressure gradient to maintain the same flow. Also, the NRDL did not alter CSF dynamics to a great degree in the SSS from the foramen magnum to the C1 level for the healthy subject and CM patient with mild tonsillar herniation (∼ 6 mm). Overall, the NRDL increased fluid mixing phenomena and resulted in a more complex flow field. Comparison of the streamlines of CSF flow revealed that the presence of NRDL lead to the formation of vortical structures and remarkably increased the local mixing of the CSF throughout the SSS.

N2  - While deviated wrist postures have been linked to the development of carpal tunnel  syndrome, the relative contributions of posture-related changes in size, shape and volume of the carpal tunnel contribute to median nerve compression are unclear. The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to reconstruct the carpal tunnel from MRI data in neutral and non-neutral (30 degrees extension, 30 degrees flexion) wrist postures, and (2) to evaluate errors associated with off-axis imaging. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the carpal tunnels of 8 volunteers from the university community revealed that the orientation of the carpal tunnel was not directly explained by external wrist angle. The average orientation of the carpal tunnel was extended in all postures, ranging from 25 degrees +/-9 degrees in extension, 13 degrees +/-5 degrees in neutral and 4 degrees +/-4 degrees in the flexed wrist. Changing the orientation of the imaging plane to be perpendicular to the reconstructed carpal tunnel revealed that axial images overestimated cross-sectional area by an average of nearly 10% in extension, 4% in neutral and less than 1% in flexion. Similarly, adjusting the imaging plane to be perpendicular to external wrist angle overestimated cross-sectional area by an average of 2% in extension, 4% in neutral and 24% in flexion. Distortion of the carpal tunnel shape also became evident with rotation of the imaging plane. The data suggest that correction for the orientation of the carpal tunnel itself to be more appropriate than relying on external wrist angle. Computerized reconstruction provided detailed anatomic visualization of the carpal tunnel, and has created the framework to develop a biomechanical model of the carpal tunnel. Similar reconstruction of the tissue structures passing through (median nerve and flexor tendons) and entering the carpal tunnel (muscle tissue) will enable evaluation and partitioning of median nerve injury mechanisms.

N2  - MR tractography of the lumbosacral plexus (LSP) is challenging due to the difficulty  of acquiring high quality data and accurately estimating the neuronal tracts. We proposed an algorithm for an accurate visualization and assessment of the major LSP bundles using the segmentation of the cauda equina as seed points for the initial starting area for the fiber tracking algorithm.Twenty-six healthy volunteers underwent MRI examinations on a 3T MR scanner using the phased array coils with optimized measurement protocols for diffusion-weighted images and coronal T2 weighted 3D short-term inversion recovery sampling perfection with application optimized contrast using varying flip angle evaluation sequences used for LSP fiber reconstruction and MR neurography (MRN).The fiber bundles reconstruction was optimized in terms of eliminating the muscle fibers contamination using the segmentation of cauda equina, the effects of the normalized quantitative anisotropy (NQA) and angular threshold on reconstruction of the LSP. In this study, the NQA parameter has been used for fiber tracking instead of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the regions of interest positioning was precisely adjusted bilaterally and symmetrically in each individual subject.The diffusion data were processed in individual L3-S2 nerve fibers using the generalized Q-sampling imaging algorithm. Data (mean FA, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity, and normalized quantitative anisotropy) were statistically analyzed using the linear mixed-effects model. The MR neurography was performed in MedINRIA and post-processed using the maximum intensity projection method to demonstrate LSP tracts in multiple planes.FA values significantly decreased towards the sacral region (P < .001); by contrast, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity and NQA values significantly increased towards the sacral region (P < .001).Fiber tractography of the LSP was feasible in all examined subjects and closely corresponded with the nerves visible in the maximum intensity projection images of MR neurography. Usage of NQA instead of FA in the proposed algorithm enabled better separation of muscle and nerve fibers.The presented algorithm yields a high quality reconstruction of the LSP bundles that may be helpful both in research and clinical practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is poorly  understood. We have recently reported a significant reduction in spinal cord cross-sectional area at the stage of clinically detectable DPN. In this study, we investigated whether spinal cord atrophy occurs in early (subclinical) DPN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty-one male type 1 diabetic subjects, 24 nondiabetic control subjects, and 8 subjects with hereditary sensory motor neuropathy (HSMN) type 1A underwent detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments. Diabetic subjects were subsequently divided into three groups based on neuropathy severity (19 with no DPN, 23 with subclinical DPN, and 39 with clinically detectable DPN). All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and cord area measurements at disc level C2/C3. RESULTS: Mean corrected spinal cord area index (SCAI) (corrected for age, height, and weight) was 67.5 mm [95% CI 64.1-70.9] in diabetic subjects without DPN. Those with subclinical (62.4 mm [59.5-65.3]) and clinically detectable DPN (57.2 mm [54.9-59.6]) had lower mean SCAIs compared with subjects with no DPN (P = 0.03 and P < 0.001, respectively). No significant difference was found between diabetic subjects without DPN and nondiabetic control subjects (69.2 mm [66.3-72.0], P = 0.47). Mean SCAIs in subjects with HSMN type 1A (71.07 mm [65.3-76.9]) were not significantly different from those for nondiabetic control subjects and diabetic subjects without DPN. Among diabetic subjects, SCAI was significantly related to sural sensory conduction velocities and the Neuropathy Composite and Symptom Scores. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord involvement occurs early in DPN. There is also a significant relation between reduction in SCAI and neurophysiological assessments of DPN.

N2  - To assess the utility of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) and of MR imaging in the evaluation of  spinal cord tumors, ten consecutive patients were prospectively evaluated. T1-proton density-, and T2-weighted images were obtained in sagittal or axial planes. T1-weighted images were obtained before and after intravenous administration. Five tumors were within the cervical spinal cord; 3 neoplasms were within the thoracic cord; 1 neoplasm extended from the cervical to the thoracic cord and 1 neoplasm extended from the cervical cord to the conus medullaris. Four tumors were ependymomas; 3 were astrocytomas; 1 was an hemangioblastoma, and 1 was a metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The remaining patient died prior to spinal surgery and no autopsy was obtained. Of the precontrast sequences, tumors were best evaluated using T1-weighted images. Abnormal findings included cord widening, presence of a tumor mass, intratumoral or other associated cyst(s), and hemorrhage. Nevertheless, T1-weighted images obtained following the administration of GD were superior relative to all other pre- and post-contrast sequences for defining tumor margins, characterizing cyst(s) and delineating tumor masses. Based primarily on their appearance on post-contrast T1-weighted images, tumor-associated cysts could be subcategorized into 3 types: intratumoral cysts (found within the contrast-enhancing soft tissue mass); nonenhancing extratumoral cysts (found eitherrostral or caudal to the enhancing tumor mass); and enhancing extratumoral cysts (having an enhancing wall or containing an enhancing nodule).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

N2  - BACKGROUND: Changes in functional activity and connectivity have been shown in  patients experiencing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) pain. However, PHN-induced structural changes, particularly in the gray matter of which volume and density was widely reported to be altered by other chronic pain, have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to detect the difference in the microstructure of gray matter of PHN patients as compared to the healthy controls, and to analyze the correlation between microstructural alterations and clinical features of PHN patients. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: University hospital. METHODS: Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) was performed in 19 patients with PHN and in 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Maps of axial kurtosis (K//), mean kurtosis (MK), radial kurtosis (K) in gray matter were calculated and compared between the 2 groups. Correlations between kurtosis metrics in the regions where between-group difference was detected and pain intensity as well as lesion duration were tested by Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, PHN patients exhibited significantly decreased DKI parameters in the bilateral insula and superior temporal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus and occipital lobe, right cerebellum anterior lobe, right thalamus, caudate and parahippocampal gyrus. K// in the bilateral insula and MK in the right insula were negatively correlated with visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of PHN patients, whereas no correlation was found between DKI parameters and lesion duration of PHN pain. LIMITATION: Relatively small sample size. We still cannot determine the causal and effect relationship between the microstructural abnormalities in the gray matter and PHN. CONCLUSIONS: DKI can specifically reflect pathophysiological microstructural alterations in the cerebral gray matters of PHN patients. This feature enables magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to be a potentially valuable technique for objectively estimating the severity of PHN pain, which would provide an opportunity for elucidating the central mechanisms underlying PHN as well. KEY WORDS: Postherpetic neuralgia, diffusional kurtosis imaging, insula cortex, gray matter, voxel-based analysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Axonal loss denervates muscle, leading to an increase of fat  accumulation in the muscle. Therefore, fat fraction (FF) in whole limb muscle using MRI has emerged as a monitoring biomarker for axonal loss in patients with peripheral neuropathies. In this study, we are testing whether deep learning-based model can automate quantification of the FF in individual muscles. While individual muscle is smaller with irregular shape, manually segmented muscle MRI images have been accumulated in this lab; and make the deep learning feasible. PURPOSE: To automate segmentation on muscle MRI images through deep learning for quantifying individual muscle FF in patients with peripheral neuropathies. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. SUBJECTS: 24 patients and 19 healthy controls. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCES: 3T; Interleaved 3D GRE. ASSESSMENT: A 3D U-Net model was implemented in segmenting muscle MRI images. This was enabled by leveraging a large set of manually segmented muscle MRI images. B(1) (+) and B(1) (-) maps were used to correct image inhomogeneity. Accuracy of the automation was evaluated using Pixel Accuracy (PA), Dice Coefficient (DC) in binary masks; and Bland-Altman and Pearson correlation by comparing FF values between manual and automated methods. STATISTICAL TESTS: PA and DC were reported with their median value and standard deviation. Two methods were compared using the ± 95% confidence intervals (CI) of Bland-Altman analysis and the Pearson's coefficient (r(2) ). RESULTS: DC values were from 0.83 ± 0.17 to 0.98 ± 0.02 in thigh and from 0.63 ± 0.18 to 0.96 ± 0.02 in calf muscles. For FF values, the overall ± 95% CI and r(2) were [0.49, -0.56] and 0.989 in thigh and [0.84, -0.71] and 0.971 in the calf. DATA CONCLUSION: Automated results well agreed with the manual results in quantifying FF for individual muscles. This method mitigates the formidable time consumption and intense labor in manual segmentations; and enables the use of individual muscle FF as outcome measures in upcoming longitudinal studies. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 1.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose is to define the origin of radiculopathy of patients with  degenerative lumbar scoliosis-stenosis and to assess the correlation between percentage of initial radicular leg pain relief with selective nerve root injections and lateral canal dimensions. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Thirty-six consecutive patients (average age 72) from Twin Cities Spine Center with degenerative lumbar scoliosis (average major curve 25°) and radicular symptoms were studied. INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent 46 selective steroid injections of nerve roots concordant with clinical symptomatology. OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiographic measurements included major and lumbosacral curve Cobb angle. Computerized measurements of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) included minimum subarticular height and foramen cross-sectional area of the nerve roots that were injected. Initial response from the nerve root injections was also rated. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of nerve root symptoms were coming from the major curve, 72.2% from the lumbosacral hemicurve and 2.8% from both (P<0.001). The affected nerve roots were more frequently the L4 (34.8%) and L5 (28.3%) nerve roots. A total of 71.7% of radicular symptoms were originating from the concavity of the curve and 28.7% from the convexity (P<0.001). The relief from injections was more than 50% in 75% of the patients at 15 days postinjection. There was no statistical significant correlation (P>0.05) between the lateral canal dimensions and the initial response to injection of anesthetic plus steroid injection. CONCLUSIONS: In degenerative lumbar scoliotic curves, radicular symptoms are attributed mainly to nerve roots exiting from the concavity of the lumbosacral hemicurve. No evidence was found that the rate of initial relief from selective nerve root injections correlates with the degree of stenosis noted in the MRI.

N2  - X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy  caused by mutations in the connexin 32 (Cx32) gene. Cx32 is widely expressed in brain and peripheral nerve, yet clinical manifestations of CMTX mainly arise from peripheral neuropathy. We have evaluated two male patients with CMTX who on separate occasions developed transient ataxia, dysarthria, and weakness within 3 days of returning from ski trips at altitudes above 8,000 feet. Magnetic resonance imaging studies in both patients showed nonenhancing, confluent, and symmetrical white matter abnormalities that were more pronounced posteriorly and that resolved over several months. Magnetic transfer images in one patient demonstrated increased magnetization transfer ratios distinct from that seen in demyelination or edema. Both patients returned to their normal baseline within 2 to 3 weeks. These cases suggest that CMTX patients are at risk for developing an acute, transient, neurological syndrome when they travel to places at high altitudes and return to sea level. Cx32 mutations may cause central nervous system dysfunction by reducing the number of functioning gap junctions between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, making both cells more susceptible to abnormalities of intercellular exchange of ions and small molecules in situations of metabolic stress.

N2  - Accumulated evidence from experimental animal models suggests that neuronal loss  within the dorsal horn is involved in the development and/or maintenance of peripheral neuropathic pain. However, to date, no study has specifically investigated whether such neuroanatomical changes also occur at this level in humans. Using brain imaging techniques, we sought to determine whether anatomical changes were present in the spinal trigeminal nucleus in subjects with chronic orofacial neuropathic pain. In 22 subjects with painful trigeminal neuropathy and 44 pain-free controls, voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted anatomical images and diffusion tensor images were used to assess regional gray matter volume and microstructural changes within the brainstem. In addition, deterministic tractography was used to assess the integrity of ascending pain pathways. Orofacial neuropathic pain was associated with significant regional gray matter volume decreases, fractional anisotropy increases, and mean diffusivity decreases within the spinal trigeminal nucleus, specifically the subnucleus oralis. In addition, tractography revealed no significant differences in diffusivity properties in the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve, the spinal trigeminal tract, or the ventral trigeminothalamic tracts in painful trigeminal neuropathy subjects compared with controls. These data reveal that chronic neuropathic pain in humans is associated with discrete alterations in the anatomy of the primary synapse. These neuroanatomical changes may be critical for the generation and/or maintenance of pathological pain.

N2  - Objective.The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the central nervous system  with the rest of the body to regulate many physiological functions and is therapeutically targeted to treat diseases such as epilepsy, depression, intestinal dysmotility, chronic pain, and more. However, we still lack understanding of PNS innervation in most organs because the large span, diffuse nature, and small terminal nerve bundle fibers have precluded whole-organism, high resolution mapping of the PNS. We sought to produce a comprehensive peripheral nerve atlas for use in future interrogation of neural circuitry and selection of targets for neuromodulation.Approach.We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) with high-speed compressed sensing to generate a tractogram of the whole mouse PNS. The tractography generated from the DT-MRI data is validated using lightsheet microscopy on optically cleared, antibody stained tissue.Main results.Herein we demonstrate the first comprehensive PNS tractography in a whole mouse. Using this technique, we scanned the whole mouse in 28 h and mapped PNS innervation and fiber network in multiple organs including heart, lung, liver, kidneys, stomach, intestines, and bladder at 70µm resolution. This whole-body PNS tractography map has provided unparalleled information; for example, it delineates the innervation along the gastrointestinal tract by multiple sacral levels and by the vagal nerves. The map enabled a quantitative tractogram that revealed relative innervation of the major organs by each vertebral foramen as well as the vagus nerve.Significance.This novel high-resolution nerve atlas provides a potential roadmap for future neuromodulation therapies and other investigations into the neural circuits which drive homeostasis and disease throughout the body.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) and  estimates of diffusivity are sensitive to the microstructure of peripheral nerves and may be displayed as tractograms. However, the ideal conditions for tractography of the roots of the brachial plexus are unclear, which represents the rationale for this study. Ten healthy adults were scanned using a Siemens Prisma (3T) and single-shot echo-planar imaging (b-value 0/1000 s/mm(2), 64 directions, 2.5 mm(3) with 4 averages; repeated in opposing phase encoding directions). Susceptibility correction and tractography were performed in DSI Studio by two independent raters. The effect of FA thresholding at increments of 0.01 (from 0.04 to 0.10) were tested. The mean FA varied between subjects by 2% (95% CI 1%, 3%). FA thresholds of 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 all propagated 96% of tracts representing the roots; thresholding at 0.07 yielded 4% fewer tracts (p = 0.2), 0.08 yielded 11% fewer tracts (p = 0.008), 0.09 yielded 15% fewer tracts (p = 0.001) and 0.1 yielded 20% fewer tracts (p < 0.001). There was < 0.1% inter-rater variability in the measured FA and 99% agreement for tractography (κ = 0.92, p < 0.001). The fractional anisotropy thresholds required to generate tractograms of the roots of the brachial plexus appears to be lower than those used in the brain. We provide estimates of the probability of generating true tracts for each spinal nerve root of the brachial plexus, at different fractional anisotropy thresholds.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy (DN) is assumed to begin in the  distal legs with a subsequent progression to hands and arms at later stages. In contrast, recent studies have found that lower limb nerve lesions in DN predominate at the proximal sciatic nerve and that, in the upper limb, nerve functions can be impaired at early stages of DN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single-center cross-sectional study, participants underwent diffusion-weighted 3 Tesla magnetic resonance neurography in order to calculate the sciatic nerve's fractional anisotropy (FA), a surrogate parameter for structural nerve integrity. Results were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological assessments of the lower limb and an examination of hand function derived from the Purdue Pegboard Test. RESULTS: Overall, 71 patients with diabetes, 11 patients with prediabetes and 25 age-matched control subjects took part in this study. In patients with diabetes, the sciatic nerve's FA showed positive correlations with tibial and peroneal nerve conduction velocities (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and r = 0.56; p < 0.001, respectively), and tibial and peroneal nerve compound motor action potentials (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and r = 0.63; p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the sciatic nerve's FA was correlated with the Pegboard Test results in patients with diabetes (r = 0.52; p < 0.001), prediabetes (r = 0.76; p < 0.001) and in controls (r = 0.79; p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that the sciatic nerve's FA is a surrogate marker for functional and electrophysiological parameters of both upper and lower limbs in patients with diabetes and prediabetes, suggesting that nerve damage in these patients is not restricted to the level of the symptomatic limbs but rather affects the entire peripheral nervous system.

N2  - PURPOSE: AGel amyloidosis is systemic amyloidosis caused by pathogenic variants in  the GSN gene. In this study, we sought to characterize the clinical and brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) features of Korean patients with AGel amyloidosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 13 patients with AGel amyloidosis from three unrelated families. Brain MRIs were performed in eight patients and eight age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Therein, we analyzed gray and white matter content using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and FreeSurfer. RESULTS: The median age at examination was 73 (interquartile range: 64-76) years. The median age at onset of cutis laxa was 20 (interquartile range: 15-30) years. All patients over that age of 60 years had dysarthria, cutis laxa, dysphagia, and facial palsy. Two patients in their 30s had only mild cutis laxa. The median age at dysarthria onset was 66 (interquartile range: 63.5-70) years. Ophthalmoparesis was observed in three patients. No patient presented with muscle weakness of the limbs. Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images of the brain showed no significant differences between the patient and control groups. Also, analysis of VBM, TBSS, and FreeSurfer revealed no significant differences in cortical thickness between patients and healthy controls at the corrected significance level. CONCLUSION: Our study outlines the clinical manifestations of prominent bulbar palsy and early-onset cutis laxa in 13 Korean patients with AGel amyloidosis and confirms that AGel amyloidosis mainly affects the peripheral nervous system rather than the central nervous system.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study reports on a patient who developed degeneration of an injured  spinothalamic tract (STT) detected on diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old female had suffered from head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident. The patient did not experience loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia and the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. She had begun to feel pain in her left hand and foot at ~ 7 days after onset. The characteristics and severity of pain were as follows: constant tingling and pricking sensation without allodynia or hyperalgesia (Visual Analogue Scale score: 3~4). No specific focal lesion was observed on brain and spine MRI and an electromyography study showed no evidence of peripheral nerve injury or radiculopathy. At 6 months after onset, the central pain in the left hand and foot became aggravated, with a Visual Analogue Scale score of 6. RESULTS: On 1-month DTT, partial tearing was observed in both STTs. In contrast, both partially torn STTs had become atrophy on 9-month DTT. CONCLUSIONS: This study recommends further studies conducted on the prognosis (regeneration or degeneration) of injured STTs and on the effect of change of an injured STT on central pain.

N2  - Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) is a rare autosomal recessive  neurodegenerative disorder characterized by infantile onset and rapid progression of psychomotor regression and hypotonia evolving into spasticity. The neuroradiologic hallmark of the disease is represented by progressive cerebellar atrophy. Prior to the discovery of mutations in the PLA2G6 gene in family with INAD, the clinical diagnosis of the disease had been confirmed by the presence of spheroid bodies (SB) in a peripheral nerve biopsy. Various studies have found that some patients with mutations lacked SB and some without mutations had SB, indicating incomplete detection using either pathologic or molecular methods (7). This, together with the observation that the spectrum of clinical features associated with mutations in PLA2G6 is broader than previously described, has increased the usefulness of Magnetic Resonance (MR) in INAD diagnosis, particularly in the frequent occurrence of atypical cases, especially in the early stages of the disease. We retrospectively reviewed the MR studies of eight patients in whom clinical and imaging onset met the typical criteria for INAD. Their clinical and MR imaging (MRI) onset and follow-up were evaluated together with the neuroradiological findings reported in the literature in order to identify MRI features useful in differentiating INAD from other diseases with similar clinical onset and to discuss which of them are the most important, thus suggesting INAD diagnosis. Our contribution included the use of Proton Spectroscopy ((1)H-MR), diffusion weighted MR imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the follow-up of seven of the eight patients. The literature reviewed included attempts to correlate clinical and MR data with the genotype in the group of patients carrying PLA2G6 mutations. From the limited and inhomogeneous cohort of patients included in our study, a correlation between the MR features, phenotype and genotype was not exhaustive.

N2  - Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that occur commonly in  individuals with neurocutaneous disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1. Vagal nerve neurofibromas, however, are a relatively rare occurrence. We present the case of a 22-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with a neurofibroma of the left cervical vagal nerve. The mass was resected through an anterior approach without major event. In the postoperative course, the patient developed left vocal cord paralysis treated with medialization with injectable gel. We then present a comprehensive review of the literature for surgical resection of vagal nerve neurofibromas.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Acquired copper deficiency in adults is associated with a subacute to  chronic progressive myeloneuropathy and optic neuropathy. OBJECTIVE: To describe an individual after gastric bypass surgery who developed a chronic progressive myeloneuropathy, an acute optic neuropathy, along with anemia and leukopenia. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Academic center. Patient A 55-year-old woman, following gastric bypass surgery 22 years earlier, developed progressive numbness, weakness, and sphincter disturbance over 6 years. She awoke one morning with bilateral blindness. Examination findings showed evidence of severe myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic resonance imaging, optical coherence tomography, electrophysiologic studies, nerve and muscle biopsy specimens, and vision testing. RESULTS: Over 1 year of follow-up, copper infusion therapy seemed to stabilize the progressive myeloneuropathy and improved leukopenia and anemia. It had no effect on the optic neuropathy. Optic nerve tissue injury was observed on magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and on optical coherence tomography. CONCLUSIONS: Copper deficiency should be considered in cases of atypical optic neuropathy. Serum copper levels should be monitored in patients with a compatible neurologic syndrome who have undergone gastric bypass surgery. Although visual acuity did not improve after copper infusion in our patient, prompt recognition of copper deficiency may prevent further deterioration.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize structural changes and the metabolic profile of foot  muscles and correlate them with diabetic neuropathy measurements using phosphorus-31 ((31)P) rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 12 control subjects, 9 non-neuropathic diabetic patients, and 12 neuropathic diabetic patients using (31)P RARE and proton ((1)H) MRI at 3 Tesla. The ratio of the total cross-sectional area of the foot to that of the muscle tissue was calculated from transaxial (1)H and (31)P images. The average (31)P concentration across the metatarsal head region was measured from the (31)P images. RESULTS: The muscle area-to-total area ratio differed among all three groups (means +/- SD): 0.55 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.06 for control, non-neuropathic, and neuropathic subjects, respectively (P < 0.0001). The average (31)P concentration also differed among all groups: 27.7 +/- 3.8 vs. 21.7 +/- 4.8 vs. 7.9 +/- 8.8 mmol/l for control, non-neuropathic, and neuropathic subjects (P < 0.0001). The muscle area-to-total area ratio strongly correlated with clinical measurements: Neuropathy Disability Score, r = -0.83, P < 0.0001; vibration perception threshold, r = -0.79, P < 0.0001; and Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, r = -0.87, P < 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Small muscle atrophy is present in diabetes before clinical peripheral neuropathy can be detected using standard clinical techniques. The (31)P RARE MRI method evaluates the severity of muscle atrophy, even in the early stages when neuropathy is absent. This technique may prove to be a useful diagnostic tool in identifying early-stage diabetic foot problems.

N2  - Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders  present at birth with muscle weakness, hypotonia and contractures. Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders with muscle weakness, hypotonia and contractures present at birth. A particular subset of classic CMD is characterized by a complete absence of merosin. Merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDCMD) is a rare genetic disease involving the central and peripheral nervous system in the childhood. High signal intensities are often observed throughout the centrum semiovale, periventricular, and sub-cortical white matters on T2-weighted images in MRI brain in children with MDCMD. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map may reveal increased signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient values in the periventricular and deep white matters. These white matter findings, observed in late infancy, decrease in severity with age. The pathogenesis of these changes remains uncertain at present. In this article, we outline the specific MR imaging findings seen in a patient with documented MDCMD and also suggest the causes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to test the prognostic significance of  intraoperative changes in the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the volume of the optic chiasma and their correlation with visual outcome. METHODS Twenty-eight sequential patients with suprasellar tumors presenting with chiasma compression syndrome were surgically treated under intraoperative MRI control between March 2014 and July 2016. The FA and the volume of the optic chiasma were measured immediately before and immediately after tumor resection. The visual impairment score (VIS) was used to quantify the severity of the ophthalmological disturbances before surgery, 10-14 days after surgery, and again 3 months thereafter. The change in the FA and the volume of the optic chiasma was correlated to the improvement of vision. The correlation between other predictors such as the age of the patients and the duration of symptoms and the visual outcome was tested. RESULTS The VIS improved significantly after surgery. The FA values of the optic chiasma decreased significantly after decompression, whereas the volume of the optic chiasma increased significantly after decompression. The early and delayed improvement of vision was strongly correlated to the decrease in the average FA and the increase of the volume of the optic chiasma. The duration of symptoms showed a significant negative correlation to the visual outcome. However, the decrease in the FA showed the strongest correlation to the improvement of the VIS, followed by the expansion of the optic chiasma, and then the duration of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The decrease in the FA and the expansion of the optic chiasma after its decompression are strong early predictors of the visual outcome. These parameters are also able to predict delayed improvement of vision.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: In this study, we aimed to determine whether muscle transverse  relaxation time (T(2) ) magnetic resonance (MR) mapping results correlate with motor unit loss, as defined by motor unit recruitment patterns on electromyography (EMG). METHODS: EMG and 3-Tesla MRI exams were acquired no more than 31 days apart in subjects referred for peripheral nerve MRI. Two musculoskeletal radiologists qualitatively graded T(2) -weighted, fat-suppressed sequences for severity of muscle edema-like patterns and manually placed regions of interest within muscles to obtain T(2) values from T(2) -mapping sequences. Concordance was calculated between qualitative and quantitative MR grades and EMG recruitment categories (none, discrete, decreased) as well as interobserver agreement for both MR grades. RESULTS: Thirty-four muscles (21 abnormal, 13 control) were assessed in 13 subjects (5 females and 8 males; mean age, 46 years) with 14 EMG-MRI pairs. T(2) -relaxation times were significantly (P < .001) increased in all EMG recruitment categories compared with control muscles. T(2) differences were not significant between EMG grades of motor unit recruitment (P = .151-.702). T(2) and EMG score concordance was acceptable (Harrell's concordance index [c index]: rater A, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.87; rater B, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-0.91). Qualitative MRI and EMG score concordance was poor to acceptable (c index: rater A, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50-0.79; rater B, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89). T(2) values had moderate-to-substantial ability to distinguish between absent vs incomplete (ie, decreased or discrete) motor unit recruitment (c index: rater A, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50-1.00; rater B, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.57-1.00). DISCUSSION: Quantitative T(2) MR muscle mapping is a promising tool for noninvasive evaluation of the degree of motor unit recruitment loss.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) is a technique that  is worthwhile for anesthesiologists because it allows spinal cord and plexus anatomy to be visualized three dimensionally and followed over time in the same animal. For example, the long-term effect of indwelling intrathecal or plexus catheters can be studied in situ, and convective and diffusive forces within intrathecal, epidural, or nerve sheath spaces can be investigated. Further, diffusion-weighted MRM, which measures an "apparent diffusion coefficient" (ADC), can be used to track the presence of ischemia, hypoperfusion, or cytotoxic edema. This study investigates problems associated with the use of in vivo MRM for spinal cord and peripheral nerve studies in the rat. METHODS: Twenty-one anesthetized female Fisher CDF rats were used. Group 1 (n=7) was used for anatomic three-dimensional studies. Groups 2 (n=4), 3 (n=4), and 4 (n=6) were used for measurements of the ADC. Group 2 served as controls, group 3 received lumbar intrathecal catheters, and group 4 received cervical intrathecal catheters. RESULTS: Cervical spine, lumbar spine, and spinal nerves and ganglia were accurately visualized with MRM. As a rule, spinal cord gray and white matter were better demonstrated using diffusion-weighted proton stains. By contrast, T2-weighted proton staining superiorly demonstrated structures surrounding the spinal cord. In groups 3 and 4, indwelling intrathecal catheters did not affect the spinal cord ADC, indicating normal blood flow and no cytotoxic edema. Contrast studies revealed nonhomogeneous distribution of contrast predominately in the lateral and ventral intrathecal space. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional diffusion-weighted MRM displays cervical and lumbar spine anatomy accurately in vivo. Apparent diffusion coefficients measurements are feasible in rat cervical spinal cord with intrathecal catheters. Spinal cord ADCs are unaffected by intrathecal catheters, indicating normal spinal cord perfusion.

N2  - The concept of rejecting the null hypothesis for definitively detecting a signal was  extended to relaxation spectrum space for multiexponential reconstruction. The novel test was applied to the problem of detecting the myelin signal, which is believed to have a time constant below 40 ms, in T2 decays from magnetic resonance imagining of the human brain. It was demonstrated that the test allowed the detection of a signal in a relaxation spectrum by using only the information in the data, thus avoiding any potentially unreliable prior information. The test was implemented both explicitly and implicitly for simulated T2 measurements. For the explicit implementation, the null hypothesis was that a relaxation spectrum existed that had no signal below 40 ms and that was consistent with the T2 decay. The confidence level by which the null hypothesis could be rejected gave the confidence level that there was signal below the 40 ms time constant. The explicit implementation assessed the test's performance with and without prior information where the prior information was the non-negative relaxation spectrum assumption. The test was also implemented implicitly with a data conserving multiexponential reconstruction algorithm that used left invertible matrices and that has been published previously. The implicit and explicit implementations demonstrated similar characteristics in detecting the myelin signal in both the simulated and experimental T2 decays, providing additional evidence to support the close link between the two tests. When the relaxation spectrum was assumed to be non-negative, the novel test required signal to noise ratios (SNRs) approaching 1000 in the T2 decays for detection of the myelin signal with high confidence. When the relaxation spectrum was not assumed to be non-negative, the SNR requirements for a detection with high confidence increased by a factor of 25. The application of the test to a T2 decay from human white matter, measured in vivo with a SNR of 650, demonstrated a solid detection of the signal below 40 ms believed to be due to the myelin water. This study demonstrated the robustness and reliability of extending the concept of rejecting the null hypothesis to relaxation spectrum space. The study also raised serious questions about the susceptibility to false positive detection of the myelin signal of the multiexponential reconstruction algorithms currently in use.

N2  - SPG11 belongs to the autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) and  presents during childhood or puberty with a complex clinical phenotype encompassing learning difficulties, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, and mental retardation. We hereby present the case of a 30-year-old female patient with complex autosomal recessive HSP with thinning of the corpus callosum (TCC) and dementia that was compound heterozygous with two novel mutations in the SPG11 gene. Sequence analysis of the SPG11 gene revealed two novel mutations in a compound heterozygous state in the index patient (c.2431C>T/p.Gln811Ter and c.6755_6756insT/p.Glu2252Aspfs*88). MRI showed abnormal TCC, white matter (WM) hyperintensities periventricularly, and the 'ears of the lynx' sign. Diffusion tensor imaging showed a mild-to-moderate decrease in fractional anisotropy and an increase in mean diffusivity in WM compared to age-matched controls, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed abnormal findings in affected WM with a decrease in N-acetyl-aspartate in WM regions of interest. This is the first SPG11 kindred from the Greek population to be reported in the medical literature.

N2  - PURPOSE: To (a) locate neurovascular bundles (NVB) on pelvic CT and (b)  retrospectively evaluate relationships between radiation dose to structures putatively involved in prostate brachytherapy-induced erectile dysfunction (ED) and incidence of postbrachytherapy ED. METHODS AND MATERIALS: (a) Right/left NVB were identified on nine prostate MRIs. Structures visible on MRI and CT were cross-referenced. Cross-sectional area of each NVB was measured. (b) All patients treated with implant alone and whose treatment was planned on Variseed (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA), with follow-up of >12 months were included; n = 41. Median follow-up was 20 months. All patients were potent (+/- sildenafil) before implant (erection sufficient for intercourse). The right/left NVB (using results from part "a"), penile bulb, and right/left crus were outlined on postimplant CT. Volumes and doses to these structures were calculated. RESULTS: (a) On prostate MRI, NVB was consistently located where the prostate border bends away from the levator ani, at the gland's smallest radius of curvature. Average area of the circle best encompassing the NVB = 0.27 cm(2); diameter was 0.58 cm. (b) 11 of 41 (27%) patients had ED; 30 of 41 were potent (15 with sildenafil). There was no significant difference between potent/impotent patients in isotope, age, diabetes, hypertension, follow-up, or volume of prostate, bulb, right/left NVB, or right/left crus. There was a relationship between smoking and ED (p = 0.05). There was a relationship between bulb %D90 and ED: >10% 67% (4 of 6) vs. <10% 20% (7 of 35) (p = 0.03), which remained when controlling for smoking. There was no relationship between dose to left NVB and potency. There was paradoxical decreased risk of ED with right NVB %V100 >60% (p = 0.019), and right NVB %D60 >100% (p = 0.003). There was no relationship between dose to right/left crus and ED. CONCLUSIONS: A reliable method for localizing NVB on CT is demonstrated. There is no increased risk of prostate brachytherapy-induced ED with increasing dose to crus or NVB at the doses given in this study. There is a possible dose-response relationship between dose to the bulb and risk of ED.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus has a high incidence in general population and goes by  high morbidity by specific micro vascular pathology in the retina, renal glomerul and peripheral nerves. In type 1 DM, intensive therapy can prevent or delay the development of long-term complications associated with DM but hypoglycaemia especially severe hypoglycaemia defined, as a low blood glucose resulting in stupor, seizure, or unconsciousness that precludes self-treatment is a serious threat. Hypoglycaemia that may preferentially harm neurons in the medial temporal region, specifically the hippocampus, is a potential danger for the brain cognitive function which several studies failed to detect any significant effects, whereas others indicated an influence on it. A young diabetic case presented here with severe cognitive defect. Great number of severe hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic attacks and convulsion episodes were described in his medical history. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Neuroradiologic findings on CT and MRI, pointed that global cerebral atrophy that is incompatible with his age. Brain perfusion studies (SPECT, (99m)Tc-labeled HMPAO) also showed that there were severe perfusion defects at superior temporal region and less perfusion defects at gyrus cingulum in frontal region. These regions are related with memory processing. Severe cognitive defect in this patient seems to be closely related these changes and no another reason was found to explain except the repeated severe hypoglycaemic episodes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type 1  (NF1), a common inherited disease that limits life expectancy. No data are available on cardiac damage in NF1 patients with hypertension. We evaluated cardiac function in NF1 patients with hypertension diagnosed by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), compared with normal children. METHODS: We studied 73 NF1 patients (41 boys; mean age 12 years) and 30 normal children comparable for age and sex, using standard 2D echocardiography, standard Doppler and Doppler tissue imaging (DTI). Twelve patients (16%) showed 24-h systolic blood pressure (SBP) or 24-h diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >95th percentile for age and sex. We divided the NF1 group into two subgroups: group A, patients with 24-h SBP and DBP </=95th percentile for age and sex, and group B, patients with 24-h SBP or DBP >95th percentile for age and sex. RESULTS: Group B presented a thicker end-diastolic interventricular septum (p<0.0001), posterior wall (p=0.02), LVMI (p<0.001) and relative wall thickness (p<0.03) than group A and controls. Left atrial dimension in group B was also significantly larger. Examination by standard Doppler showed a deceleration and isovolumic relaxation time significantly prolonged in group B. DTI parameters were significantly higher in NF1 patients than controls. In group B, myocardial early diastolic (E(m)) and systolic (S(m)) velocities were significantly lower than group A. Myocardial early/late diastolic ratio (E(m)/A(m)) in NF1 patients was lower than controls and 19% of group A and 20% of group B showed an E(m)/A(m) ratio <1. No healthy subjects presented an E(m)/A(m) ratio <1. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated early cardiac morphologic and functional changes in young NF1 patients with hypertension. Because DTI directly studies cardiac muscle, it can detect changes induced by hypertension as well as those independent of blood pressure.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene at  17q11.2. In 95% of non-founder NF1 patients, NF1 mutations are identifiable by means of a comprehensive mutation analysis. 5-10% of these patients harbour microdeletions encompassing the NF1 gene and its flanking regions. NF1 is characterised by tumours of the peripheral nerve sheaths, the pathognomonic neurofibromas. Considerable inter- and intra-familial variation in expressivity of the disease has been observed which is influenced by genetic modifiers unrelated to the constitutional NF1 mutation. The number of plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) in NF1 patients is a highly heritable genetic trait. Recently, SNP rs2151280 located within the non-coding RNA gene ANRIL at 9p21.3, was identified as being strongly associated with PNF number in a family-based association study. The T-allele of rs2151280, which correlates with reduced ANRIL expression, appears to be associated with higher PNF number. ANRIL directly binds to the SUZ12 protein, an essential component of polycomb repressive complex 2, and is required for SUZ12 occupancy of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B tumour suppressor genes as well as for their epigenetic silencing. METHODS: Here, we explored a potential association of PNF number and PNF volume with SNP rs2151280 in 29 patients with constitutional NF1 microdeletions using the exact Cochran-Armitage test for trends and the exact Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Both the PNF number and total tumour volume in these 29 NF1 patients were assessed by whole-body MRI. The NF1 microdeletions observed in these 29 patients encompassed the NF1 gene as well as its flanking regions, including the SUZ12 gene. RESULTS: In the 29 microdeletion patients investigated, neither the PNF number nor PNF volume was found to be associated with the T-allele of rs2151280. CONCLUSION: Our findings imply that, at least in patients with NF1 microdeletions, PNF susceptibility is not associated with rs2151280. Although somatic inactivation of the NF1 wild-type allele is considered to be the PNF-initiating event in NF1 patients with intragenic mutations and patients with NF1 microdeletions, both patient groups may differ with regard to tumour progression because of the heterozygous constitutional deletion of SUZ12 present only in patients with NF1 microdeletions.

N2  - Functional and structural brain alterations have been noted in carpal tunnel  syndrome (CTS), the most common entrapment peripheral neuropathy. Previous studies were mainly focused on somatosensory cortices. However, the changes of white matter diffusion properties in nonsensorimotor cortices remain uninvestigated. We utilized a modified tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) pipeline to explore CTS-related white matter plasticity, omitting the skeletonization step and registering diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data to a study-specific, high resolution T1 template by an optimized registration method. The modified TBSS was demonstrated to be more sensitive to detect changes in white matter integrity than the standard TBSS approach. In this study, 25 moderate/severe CTS patients and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were evaluated with DTI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) were calculated for group comparison. And the relationship between diffusion parameters and clinical assessments was also analyzed. Comparing with the healthy controls, CTS patients showed significantly increased FA and decreased RD in areas of multisensory integration and motor control involving the central opercular cortex and supplementary motor area (SMA) of the dominant hemisphere. Moreover, altered diffusion parameters in the central opercular cortex of the dominant hemisphere were significantly correlated with Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) scores. It is considered to be a form of maladaptive neuroplastic response to CTS-associated afference and motor control deficits. Such insight may be helpful in developing new strategies for the treatment of CTS.

N2  - Mutations in the NEFH gene encoding the heavy neurofilament protein are usually  associated with neuronal damage and susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recently, frameshift variants in NEFH (p.Asp1004Glnfs*58 and p.Pro1008Alafs*56) have been reported to be the underlying cause of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2CC (CMT2CC). The frameshift mutation resulted in a stop loss and translation of a cryptic amyloidogenic element (CAE) encoded by the 3' untranslated region (UTR). This study also identified a de novo c.3015_3027dup frameshift mutation predicting p.Lys1010Glnfs*57 in NEFH from a CMT2 family with an atypical clinical symptom of prominent proximal weakness. This mutation is located near the previously reported frameshift mutations, suggesting a mutational hotspot. Lower limb magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed marked hyperintense signal changes in the thigh muscles compared with those in the calf muscles. Therefore, this study suggests that the stop loss and translational elongations by the 3' UTR of the NEFH mutations may be a relatively frequent genetic cause of axonal peripheral neuropathy with the specific characteristics of proximal dominant weakness.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Thalamus is essential in processing of sensory information. This study  explored the associations between thalamic volume and intra-thalamic metabolites and associations to clinical and experimental characteristics of sensory function in adults with diabetic polyneuropathy. METHODS: 48 adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy (DPSN) and 28 healthy controls participated in a cross-sectional study and underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Estimates for thalamic volume were extracted using voxel-based morphometry and intra-thalamic N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/cre) levels were assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Associations between thalamic volume and clinical measures, quantitative sensory testing and neuropathic phenotype were explored. RESULTS: In diabetes, reduced gray matter volume was identified including bilateral thalamus (all p≤0.001) in comparison to healthy participants. Thalamic volume estimates were positively associated to intra-thalamic NAA/cre (r=0.4; p=0.006), however not to diabetes duration (p=0.5), severity of DSPN (p=0.7), or presence of pain (p=0.3). Individuals with the lowest thalamic volume had greatest loss of protective sensation (light touch using von Frey-like filaments, p=0.037) and highest pain tolerance to electric stimulation (tetanic stimulation, p=0.008) compared to individuals with the highest thalamic volume. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort with type 1 diabetes and severe DSPN, thalamic atrophy was present and associated with reduced NAA/cre, indicating thalamic structural loss and dysfunction. Thalamic atrophy was associated to reduced sensory function involving large fiber neuropathy and sensation to tetanic stimulation that may reflect synaptic transmission. This may ultimately contribute to the current understanding of the pathophysiology behind the perception changes evident in DSPN.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clinicoradiologic differentiation between benign and malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) has important management implications. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate machine-learning approaches to differentiate benign from malignant PNSTs. METHODS: We identified PNSTs treated at 3 institutions and extracted high-dimensional radiomics features from gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Training and test sets were selected randomly in a 70:30 ratio. A total of 900 image features were automatically extracted using the PyRadiomics package from Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline. Clinical data including age, sex, neurogenetic syndrome presence, spontaneous pain, and motor deficit were also incorporated. Features were selected using sparse regression analysis and retained features were further refined by gradient boost modeling to optimize the area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosis. We evaluated the performance of radiomics-based classifiers with and without clinical features and compared performance against human readers. RESULTS: A total of 95 malignant and 171 benign PNSTs were included. The final classifier model included 21 imaging and clinical features. Sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.676, 0.882, and 0.845, respectively, were achieved on the test set. Using imaging and clinical features, human experts collectively achieved sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 0.786, 0.431, and 0.624, respectively. The AUC of the classifier was statistically better than expert humans (P = .002). Expert humans were not statistically better than the no-information rate, whereas the classifier was (P = .001). CONCLUSION: Radiomics-based machine learning using routine MRI sequences and clinical features can aid in evaluation of PNSTs. Further improvement may be achieved by incorporating additional imaging sequences and clinical variables into future models.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a difference between healthy control group  and children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in terms of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in different regions of the brain associated with neurocognitive functions and to investigate the correlation between diffusion tensor imaging parameters and neurocognitive dysfunctions. METHODS: The study included 28 children with NF1 and 21 controls. Nine distinct areas related to cognitive functions were selected for the analysis. The ADC and FA values were compared. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between NF1 and healthy control in terms of ADC values obtained from all areas. The ADC values at obtained from thalamus and striatum were positively correlated with the full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ), verbal IQ, and performance IQ. CONCLUSIONS: We are speculated that the development of microstructural damage in the thalamostriatal pathway may lead to neurocognitive dysfunction.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcomes and safety after CT-guided percutaneous  sacroplasty in patients with painful sacral insufficiency fractures or pathologic sacral lesions. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter analysis of consecutive patients undergoing CT-guided sacroplasty for painful sacral insufficiency fractures or sacral lesions was undertaken. The inclusion criteria consisted of severe sacral pain not responding to conservative medical management with imaging evidence of unilateral or bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures or lesions. Outcome measures included hospitalization status (inpatient or outpatient), pre-treatment and post-treatment visual analog scale (VAS) scores, analgesic use and complications. Patients were followed at approximately 1 month and for at least 1 year after their sacroplasty procedure. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-three patients were included in the study, 204 with painful sacral insufficiency fractures and 39 with symptomatic sacral lesions. The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.2±1.1 was significantly improved after sacroplasty to 1.9±1.7 in patients with sacral insufficiency fractures (p<0.001). The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.0±0.9 in patients with sacral lesions was significantly improved after sacroplasty to 2.6±2.4 (p<0.001). There were no major complications or procedure-related deaths. One patient who was treated for a sacral insufficiency fracture experienced radicular pain due to local extravasation of cement that subsequently required surgical decompression for symptomatic relief. CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided percutaneous sacroplasty is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of painful sacral insufficiency fractures or lesions. It is associated with prompt and durable pain relief and should be considered as an effective treatment option in this patient population.

N2  - Facial synkinesis is a troublesome sequelae of facial nerve malfunction. It is  difficult to recover from synkinesis, despite improved surgical techniques for isolating the peripheral facial nerve branches. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether long-term dysfunction of motor control can lead to irreversible plasticity-induced structural brain changes. This case-control study thus investigated the structural brain alterations associated with facial synkinesis. The study was conducted at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China. Twenty patients with facial synkinesis (2 male and 18 female, aged 33.35 ± 6.97 years) and 19 healthy volunteers (2 male and 17 female, aged 33.21 ± 6.75 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and voxel-based and surface-based morphometry techniques were used to analyze data. There was no significant difference in brain volume between patients with facial synkinesis and healthy volunteers. Patients with facial synkinesis exhibited a significantly reduced cortical thickness in the contralateral superior and inferior temporal gyri and a reduced sulcal depth of the ipsilateral precuneus compared with healthy volunteers. In addition, sulcal depth of the ipsilateral precuneus was negatively correlated with the severity of depression. These findings suggest that there is a structural remodeling of gray matter in patients with facial synkinesis after facial nerve malfunction. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China (approval No. 2017-365-T267) on September 13, 2017, and was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR1800014630) on January 25, 2018.

N2  - This report details previously undescribed sonographic findings in the anterior  interosseous nerve syndrome. Loss of muscle bulk, increased reflectivity, reduced perfusion on Doppler sonography, and lack of active contraction of the affected muscles were observed. These findings can aid in the localization of the pathologic process and in the exclusion of tendon rupture. Dynamic observation of muscle function and Doppler changes after exercise can also help identify the muscles involved. Both sonography and MRI may be useful in the evaluation of patients with the anterior interosseous nerve syndrome and other peripheral neuropathies.

N2  - CONTEXT: Although diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is predominantly considered a  disorder of the peripheral nerves, some evidence for central nervous system involvement has recently emerged. However, whether or to what extent the microstructure of central somatosensory tracts may be injured remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to detect the microstructure of central somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients and to correlate it with the severity of DPN. METHODS: A case-control study at a tertiary referral hospital took place with 57 individuals with type 2 diabetes (25 with DPN, 32 without DPN) and 33 nondiabetic controls. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of 2 major somatosensory tracts (the spinothalamic tract and its thalamocortical [spino-thalamo-cortical, STC] pathway, the medial lemniscus and its thalamocortical [medial lemnisco-thalamo-cortical, MLTC] pathway) were assessed based on diffusion tensor tractography. Regression models were further applied to detect the association of FA values with the severity of DPN in diabetic patients. RESULTS: The mean FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly lower in patients with DPN than those without DPN and controls. Moreover, FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly associated with the severity of DPN (expressed as Toronto Clinical Scoring System values) in patients after adjusting for multiple confounders. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the axonal degeneration of central somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients with DPN. The parallel disease progression of the intracranial and extracranial somatosensory system merits further attention to the central nerves in diabetic patients with DPN.

N2  - Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of a case of Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD) using  a 1.5 T system is described. The patient showed progressive spastic diplegia with equinovarus deformity of the feet, dystonic postural movements, dysarthria, dysphagia, mental deterioration, optic nerve atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. These clinical features were compatible with HSD. Symmetrical, decreased signal intensity was seen on both proton density weighted and T2-weighted spin echo images in the globus pallidus as well as in the substantia nigra (Group I). This MR finding suggests an increased iron deposition in these subcortical nuclei, which is characteristic of HSD. The characteristic MR imaging, together with the relevant clinical features, was considered to be useful for establishing the diagnosis of HSD.

N2  - A 7-year-old female presented with fever, urinary incontinence, mental regression,  gait disturbance, and lethargy after diarrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal T(2)-weighted hypersignal lesions supportive of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Her mother had been diagnosed with hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsy. The girl was also determined to have hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy, with a 1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2 encompassing the gene for peripheral myelin protein 22 detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Hereditary peripheral neuropathies may be a factor in triggering the autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system.

N2  - The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic virus that becomes latent in the  sensory ganglia, but later causes various neurologic complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, cranial neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy [1]. While acute cerebellitis is one of the most frequent acute cerebellar diseases associated with VZV in childhood, VZV rarely causes cerebellitis in adults, with or without skin manifestations, and only a few isolated cases of adult VZV cerebellitis have been reported. We report a case of acute cerebellitis associated with VZV infection after a herpetic rash in an 80-year-old male. Functional imaging of his cerebellum showed high blood perfusion during the acute stage of the disease, though perfusion decreased in the subacute stage.

N2  - Important new information regarding neurologic complications of HIV disease was  presented at the 2007 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. In addition to presentations on pathogenesis and treatment of neurologic complications, the conference included findings that have implications for the management of HIV disease outside the nervous system. Key findings included that the distribution of antiretrovirals into the central nervous system may influence the effectiveness of treatment outside this protected compartment; that postponing initiation of therapy until blood CD4+ counts fall to 300 cells/mm3 may increase the risk for HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment but interruption of antiretroviral therapy in individuals with high CD4+ counts may have neuropsychologic benefits; that substantial changes, including macrophage activation and neuronal injury can occur shortly after HIV transmission; that HIV can influence neural progenitor cells to decrease neuronal differentiation; that newer neuroimaging technologies, such as diffusion tensor imaging and blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging can identify important effects of HIV on the brain such as alterations in cerebral oxygen consumption; that serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors may reduce HIV RNA levels in cerebral spinal fluid; and that erythropoietin and the non-immunosuppressive immunophilin ligand, GPI-1046, may improve HIV-associated injury of peripheral nerves. The conference also included an important focus on JC virus encephalitis (also known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy).

N2  - Longstanding diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the risk of complications  affecting the central nervous system. The aims were to study brain volume and cortical thickness in regional brain areas in DM patients and to correlate the findings with relevant clinical data.15 patients with longstanding (average 24.6 years) type 1 DM and 20 healthy controls were studied in a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. Using an automated surface based cortical segmentation method, cortical thickness was assessed in anatomical regions including total and lobe-wise grey and white matter volumes. Also morphological changes were evaluated.No differences between patients and controls were found in regard to number of white matter lesions (P=0.50), grey and white matter volumes (P=0.25) and overall cortical thickness (P=0.64). Subanalysis revealed exclusively reduced cortical thickness of the postcentral (P=0.03) and superior parietal gyrus (P=0.008) in patients. The cortical thickness of these regions was not associated with diabetes duration, age at diabetes onset or to HbA1c (all P>0.08). Patients with peripheral neuropathy showed reduced right postcentral gyrus cortical thickness compared to patients without peripheral neuropathy (P=0.02).Patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed cortical thinning involving sensory related areas, even though no overall macrostructural brain alterations were detected. This could possibly have underlying functional significance since cortical thinning was associated to presence of peripheral neuropathy. The absence of universal macrostructural changes might illustrate that more pronounced brain pathology is likely to be preceded by more subtle microstructural changes as reported in other studies.

N2  - MR microneurography is a noninvasive technique that provides visualization of the  microanatomy of peripheral nerves, otherwise available only with histopathology. The objective of this study was to present a protocol to visualize the microstructure of peripheral nerves in vivo, using a 3T MRI scanner with a clinical set of coils and sequences. The tibial and the common peroneal nerves of healthy volunteers were imaged above the medial malleolus and at the level of the fibular head, respectively. The acquired images provided details about the internal structure of peripheral nerves, with visualization of the fascicles, the interfascicular fat, the epineurium, and the perineurium. MR microneurography can be performed in a clinical setting with acceptable imaging times and can be a potentially powerful tool that complements standard MR neurography.

N2  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established tool in probing  cortical plasticity in vivo. Changes in corticomotor excitability can be induced using paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which TMS over the primary motor cortex is conditioned with an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the contralateral hand. PAS with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms induces long-term potentiation (LTP)-like effects in cortical excitability. However, the response to a PAS protocol tends to vary substantially across individuals. In this study, we used univariate and multivariate data-driven methods to investigate various previously proposed determinants of inter-individual variability in PAS efficacy, such as demographic, cognitive, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging measures. Forty-one right-handed participants, comprising 22 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 19 healthy controls (HC), underwent the PAS protocol. Prior to stimulation, demographic, genetic, clinical, as well as structural and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The two groups did not differ in any of the variables, except by global cognitive status. Univariate analysis showed that only 61% of all participants were classified as PAS responders, irrespective of group membership. Higher PAS response was associated with lower TMS intensity and with higher resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, but only in responders, as opposed to non-responders. We also found an overall positive correlation between PAS response and structural connectivity within the corticospinal tract, which did not differ between groups. A multivariate random forest (RF) model identified age, gender, education, IQ, global cognitive status, sleep quality, alertness, TMS intensity, genetic factors, and neuroimaging measures (functional and structural connectivity, gray matter (GM) volume, and cortical thickness as poor predictors of PAS response. The model resulted in low accuracy of the RF classifier (58%; 95% CI: 42 - 74%), with a higher relative importance of brain connectivity measures compared to the other variables. We conclude that PAS variability in our sample was not well explained by factors known to influence PAS efficacy, emphasizing the need for future replication studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Due to the lack of understanding of the fascicular organisation, vagus  nerve stimulation (VNS) leads to unwanted off-target effects. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) can be used to trace fascicles from periphery and image fascicular anatomy. NEW METHOD: In this study, we present a simple and reproducible method for imaging fascicles in peripheral nerves with iodine staining and microCT for the determination of fascicular anatomy and organisation. RESULTS: At the determined optimal pre-processing steps and scanning parameters, the microCT protocol allowed for segmentation and tracking of fascicles within the nerves. This was achieved after 24 hours and 120 hours of staining with Lugol's solution (1% total iodine) for rat sciatic and pig vagus nerves, respectively, and the following scanning parameters: 4 μm voxel size, 35 kVp energy, 114 μA current, 4 W power, 0.25 fps in 4 s exposure time, 3176 projections and a molybdenum target. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): This optimised method for imaging fascicles provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images and full imaging penetration depth not obtainable with methods typically used such as histology, magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence tomography whilst obviating time-consuming pre-processing methods, the amount of memory required, destruction of the samples and the cost associated with current microCT methods. CONCLUSION: The optimised microCT protocol facilitates segmentation and tracking of the fascicles within the nerve. The resulting segmentation map of the functional anatomical organisation of the vagus nerve will enable selective VNS ultimately allowing for the avoidance of the off-target effects and improving its therapeutic efficacy.

N2  - Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) refers to exercise-induced,  reversible increases in pressure within well-defined inelastic fascial compartments leading to compromised tissue perfusion followed by functional loss, ischemic pain, and neurologic symptoms. Symptoms typically resolve when the activity ceases and there are usually no permanent sequelae. In the upper extremity, this condition most commonly affects athletes during sports requiring repetitive and vigorous gripping, such as rowers. In addition to clinical history and examination, a number of methods aid diagnosis, including compartment pressure measurements, magnetic resonance imaging, and near infrared spectroscopy. When symptoms persist despite conservative treatment, multiple operative techniques have been described to treat CECS including open, mini-open, and endoscopic release of involved compartments. We review the pathophysiology, diagnostic modalities, treatment strategies, and outcomes data for CECS of the upper extremity while highlighting areas of residual controversy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ataxia is the commonest neurological manifestation of coeliac disease.  Some individuals with genetic susceptibility to the disease have serological evidence of gluten sensitivity without overt gastrointestinal symptoms or evidence of small-bowel inflammation. The sole manifestation of disease in such patients may be ataxia. We describe the clinical, radiological, and neurophysiological features of this disorder. METHODS: Patients with ataxia attending the neurology outpatient clinics at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK, were screened for gluten sensitivity as shown by the titre of antibody to gliadin. Those with other causes of ataxia were excluded. We carried out clinical, neurophysiological, neuroradiological, and, in two cases, neuropathological examinations. FINDINGS: 28 patients with gluten ataxia were identified. All had gait ataxia and most had limb ataxia. Those with more severe gait ataxia had longer disease duration. No patient had tremor or other extrapyramidal features. 19 patients showed some form of peripheral neuropathy on neurophysiological examination. 16 patients had no gastrointestinal symptoms. Distal duodenal biopsy showed lymphocytic infiltration in two patients, and changes compatible with coeliac disease in 11. Six patients had evidence of cerebellar atrophy on magnetic-resonance imaging. Necropsy was done on two patients who died; there was lymphocytic infiltration of the cerebellum, damage to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and sparse infiltration of the peripheral nerves. INTERPRETATION: Gluten sensitivity is an important cause of apparently idiopathic ataxia and may be progressive. The ataxia is a result of immunological damage to the cerebellum, to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and to peripheral nerves. We propose the term gluten ataxia to describe this disorder.

N2  - We sought to assess the utility of simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with the nerve-sheath signal increased by inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of relaxation-enhancement imaging (SHINKEI-Quant) for the quantitative evaluation of compressed nerves in patients with lumbar radiculopathy. Thirty-two patients with lumbar radiculopathy and 5 healthy subjects underwent simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with SHINKEI-Quant. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal nerves distal to the lumbar nerves bilaterally at L4-S1. The T2 relaxation times were measured on the affected and unaffected sides. The T2 ratio was calculated as the affected side/unaffected side. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the correlation between the T2 relaxation times or T2 ratio and clinical symptoms. An ROC curve was used to examine the diagnostic accuracy and threshold of the T2 relaxation times and T2 ratio. We observed no significant differences in the T2 relaxation times between the nerve roots on the left and right at each spinal level in healthy subjects. In patients, lumbar neurography revealed swelling of the involved nerve, and prolonged T2 relaxation times compared with that of the contralateral nerve. The T2 ratio correlated with leg pain. The ROC analysis revealed that the T2 relaxation time threshold was 127 ms and the T2 ratio threshold was 1.07. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the utility of SHINKEI-Quant for the quantitative evaluation of lumbar radiculopathy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine whether quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) adds diagnostic accuracy in magnetic resonance neurography. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. We enrolled 16 patients with peripheral polyneuropathy of various etiologies involving the upper arm and 30 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3 T using transverse T2-weighted (T2-w) turbo spin echo and spin echo planar imaging diffusion-weighted sequences. T2-weighted normalized signal (nT2), fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) of the median, ulnar, and radial nerves were quantified after manual segmentation. Diagnostic performance of each separate parameter and combinations of parameters was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Bootstrap validation was used to adjust for potential overfitting. RESULTS Average nT2, ADC, RD, and AD values of the median, ulnar, and radial nerve were significantly increased in neuropathy patients compared with that in healthy controls (nT2, 1.49 ± 0.05 vs 1.05 ± 0.05; ADC, 1.4 × 10(-3) ± 2.8 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 1.1 × 10(-3) ± 1.3 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s; RD, 9.5 × 10(-4) ± 2.9 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 7.2 × 10(-4) ± 1.3 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s; AD, 2.3 × 10(-3) ± 3.7 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 2.0 × 10(-3) ± 2.2 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Fractional anisotropy values were significantly decreased in patients (0.51 ± 0.01 vs 0.59 ± 0.01; P < 0.001). T2-weighted normalized signal and DTI parameters had comparable diagnostic accuracy (adjusted AUC: T2-w, 0.92; FA, 0.88; ADC, 0.89; AD, 0.84; RD, 0.86). Combining DTI parameters significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy over single-parameter analysis. In addition, the combination of nT2 with DTI parameters yielded excellent adjusted AUCs up to 0.97 (nT2 + FA). CONCLUSIONS Diffusion tensor imaging has high diagnostic accuracy in peripheral neuropathy. Combining DTI with T2 can outperform T2-w imaging alone and provides added value in magnetic resonance neurography.

N2  - PURPOSE To investigate the ability of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 to help detect the mildest nerve lesion conceivable, that is, subclinical ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3.0 T by using proton density- and T2-weighted relaxometry and DTI on elbows in 30 healthy subjects without clinical evidence of neuropathy. Quantitative analysis of ulnar nerve T2 and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed, and T2 and FA values were correlated to electrical nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) with Pearson correlation analysis. Additional qualitative assessment of T2-weighted and FA images was performed by two readers, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS Ten of the 30 subjects (33%) had NCV slowing across the elbow segment. Compared with subjects without NCV slowing, subjects with slowing had decreased FA values (0.51 ± 0.09 vs 0.41 ± 0.07, respectively; P = .006) and increased T2 values (64.2 msec ± 10.9 vs 76.2 msec ± 13.7, respectively; P = .01) in the proximal ulnar sulcus. FA values showed a significant correlation (P = .01) with NCV slowing over the sulcus as an electrophysiologic indicator of myelin sheath damage. Qualitative assessment of FA maps and T2-weighted images helped identify subjects with conduction slowing with a sensitivity of 80% and 55%, respectively, and a specificity of 83% and 63%. CONCLUSION FA maps can accurately depict even mild peripheral neuropathy and perform better than the current standard of reference, T2-weighted images. DTI may therefore add diagnostic value as a highly sensitive technique for the detection of peripheral neuropathy.

N2  - We have made cross-sectional image “neurograms” in which peripheral nerve has a greater signal intensity than that of other tissue. Neurographic images of the rabbit forelimb were obtained using a spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that combines fat suppression and diffusion weighting. After fat suppression the nerve shows up in relative isolation and is brighter than the surrounding tissue due to its longer T2 relaxation time of ≈︁ 50 ms compared to ≈︁ 27 ms for muscle. The addition of pulsed gradients for diffusion weighting of the MR signal further enhances the intensity of the nerve signal relative to that of surrounding muscle tissue. The greater diffusional anisotropy of nerve tissue (D∥/D∥ = 3.1) compared to that of muscle (D∥/D∥ = 1.9) allows further enhancement of the nerve by a subtraction of two diffusion-weighted images, one with the gradients oriented parallel and one with the gradients oriented perpendicular to the nerve orientation. We show that by manipulation of the MRI parameters, either echo time or pulsed gradient strength, the nerves can be made to show up as the most intense feature. This verifies the feasibility of generating three-dimensional “neurographic” images, analogous to angiograms, but which demonstrate the peripheral nerve tracts in apparent isolation.© 1992 Academic Press,Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE The aims of this study were to assess diagnostic accuracy of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), to correlate DTI with electrophysiological parameters, and to evaluate whether radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) might serve as specific biomarkers of demyelinating and axonal pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Magnetic resonance neurography of upper and lower extremity nerves (median, ulnar, radial, sciatic, tibial) was performed by single-shot DTI sequences at 3.0 T in 18 patients with a diagnosis of CIDP and 18 healthy controls, matched to age and sex. The scalar readout parameters nerve fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), RD, and AD were obtained after manual segmentation and postprocessing and compared between patients and controls. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and cutoff values were calculated by maximizing the Youden index. All patients underwent a complementary electroneurography and correlation of electrophysiological markers and DTI parameters was analyzed and described by Pearson and Spearman coefficients. RESULTS Nerve FA was decreased to a mean of 0.42 ± 0.08 in patients compared with 0.52 ± 0.04 in healthy controls (P < 0.001). This decrease in FA was a result of an increase of RD (P = 0.02), whereas AD did not differ between the two groups. Of all DTI parameters, FA showed best diagnostic accuracy with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.90. Optimal cutoff for an average FA of all analyzed nerves was 0.47, yielding a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.94. Fractional anisotropy and RD correlated strongly with electrophysiological markers of demyelination, whereas AD did not correlate with markers of axonal neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS Diffusion tensor imaging yields valid quantitative biomarkers in CIDP and might aid in diagnosis with high diagnostic accuracy. Fractional anisotropy and RD may serve as parameters of myelin sheath integrity, but AD is unable to reflect axonal damage in CIDP.

N2  - We applied diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), a recently developed MRI technique that reveals the microstructures of tissues based on its ability to monitor the random movements of water molecules, to the visualization of peripheral nerves after injury. The rat sciatic nerve was subjected to contusive injury, and the data obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to determine the tracks of nerve fibers (DTT). The DTT images obtained using the fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold value of 0.4 clearly revealed the recovery process of the contused nerves. Immediately after the injury, fiber tracking from the designated proximal site could not be continued beyond the lesion epicenter, but the intensity improved thereafter, returning to its pre-injury level by 3??weeks later. We compared the FA value, a parameter computed from the DTT data, with the results of histological and functional examinations of the injured nerves, during recovery. The FA values of the peripheral nerves were more strongly correlated with axon-related (axon density and diameter) than with myelin-related (myelin density and thickness) parameters, supporting the theories that axonal membranes play a major role in anisotropic water diffusion and that myelination can modulate the degree of anisotropy. Moreover, restoration of the FA value at the lesion epicenter was strongly correlated with parameters of motor and sensory functional recovery. These correlations of the FA values with both the histological and functional changes demonstrate the potential usefulness of DTT for evaluating clinical events associated with Wallerian degeneration and the regeneration of peripheral nerves. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objectives To assess the interreader and test-retest reliability of magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry in sciatic nerve MR neurography (MRN). Materials and methods In this prospective study, 21 healthy volunteers were examined three times on separate days by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 Tesla, consisting of an MTI sequence, a multi-echo T2 relaxometry sequence, and a high-resolution T2-weighted sequence. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density (PSD) of the sciatic nerve were assessed by two independent observers, and both interreader and test-retest reliability for all readout parameters were reported by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Results For the sciatic nerve, overall mean ± standard deviation MTR was 26.75 ± 3.5%, T2 was 64.54 ± 8.2 ms, and PSD was 340.93 ± 78.8. ICCs ranged between 0.81 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for interreader reliability and between 0.75 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for test-retest reliability. SEM for interreader reliability was 1.7% for MTR, 2.67 ms for T2, and 21.3 for PSD. SEM for test-retest reliability was 1.7% for MTR, 2.66 ms for T2, and 20.1 for PSD. Conclusions MTI and T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve are reliable and reproducible. The values of measurement imprecision reported here may serve as a guide for correct interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies. Key Points • Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve are reliable and reproducible. • The imprecision that is unavoidably associated with different scans or different readers can be estimated by the here presented SEM values for the biomarkers T2, PSD, and MTR. • These values may serve as a guide for correct interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies and possible clinical applications.
