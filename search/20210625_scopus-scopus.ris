AB  - Facial synkinesis is a troublesome sequelae of facial nerve malfunction. It is difficult to recover from synkinesis, despite improved surgical techniques for isolating the peripheral facial nerve branches. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether long-term dysfunction of motor control can lead to irreversible plasticity-induced structural brain changes. This case-control study thus investigated the structural brain alterations associated with facial synkinesis. The study was conducted at Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China. Twenty patients with facial synkinesis (2 male and 18 female, aged 33.35 ± 6.97 years) and 19 healthy volunteers (2 male and 17 female, aged 33.21 ± 6.75 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and voxel-based and surface-based morphometry techniques were used to analyze data. There was no significant difference in brain volume between patients with facial synkinesis and healthy volunteers. Patients with facial synkinesis exhibited a significantly reduced cortical thickness in the contralateral superior and inferior temporal gyri and a reduced sulcal depth of the ipsilateral precuneus compared with healthy volunteers. In addition, sulcal depth of the ipsilateral precuneus was negatively correlated with the severity of depression. These findings suggest that there is a structural remodeling of gray matter in patients with facial synkinesis after facial nerve malfunction. This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China (approval No. 2017-365-T267) on September 13, 2017, and was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR1800014630) on January 25, 2018. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) and estimates of diffusivity are sensitive to the microstructure of peripheral nerves and may be displayed as tractograms. However, the ideal conditions for tractography of the roots of the brachial plexus are unclear, which represents the rationale for this study. Ten healthy adults were scanned using a Siemens Prisma (3T) and single-shot echo-planar imaging (b-value 0/1000 s/mm2, 64 directions, 2.5 mm3 with 4 averages; repeated in opposing phase encoding directions). Susceptibility correction and tractography were performed in DSI Studio by two independent raters. The effect of FA thresholding at increments of 0.01 (from 0.04 to 0.10) were tested. The mean FA varied between subjects by 2% (95% CI 1%, 3%). FA thresholds of 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 all propagated 96% of tracts representing the roots; thresholding at 0.07 yielded 4% fewer tracts (p = 0.2), 0.08 yielded 11% fewer tracts (p = 0.008), 0.09 yielded 15% fewer tracts (p = 0.001) and 0.1 yielded 20% fewer tracts (p &lt; 0.001). There was &lt; 0.1% inter-rater variability in the measured FA and 99% agreement for tractography (κ = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001). The fractional anisotropy thresholds required to generate tractograms of the roots of the brachial plexus appears to be lower than those used in the brain. We provide estimates of the probability of generating true tracts for each spinal nerve root of the brachial plexus, at different fractional anisotropy thresholds. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - We report a novel case of multiple paragangliomas in a patient who was identified with pathogenic variants in both NF1 and SDHD genes. The proband is a man with known familial NF1 disease, diagnosed clinically in childhood. Multiple head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGL) were found during investigations for acute left sided neurological symptoms, in the region of his known plexiform neurofibroma. He was referred for genetic counselling. He underwent surgery to remove a left carotid body tumor (CBT). A pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma gene panel was tested. Blood and HNPGL tumor DNA were analyzed by whole exome sequencing. In addition to the NF1 truncating variant c.5107delA, p.(Ser1703AlafsTer7), the SDHD truncating pathogenic variant c.3G > A, p.(Met1?) was found. Tumor sequencing showed no LOH of SDHD or NF1, but monoallelic loss of 11p15 and 11q12.2-q12.3 was observed. Co-occurrence of pathogenic variants in multiple cancer susceptibility genes is rare but possible, identified by the increased use of panel testing. This is the first description of a patient presenting with NF1 and SDHD dual pathology, with HNPGL development due to SDHD. This case illustrates the central role of genetic sequencing in PPGLs and the strong genotype-phenotype correlations of different genes. © 2021

AB  - Purpose: To develop a novel MR-fingerprinting (MRF) pulse sequence that is insensitive to (Formula presented.) and B0 imperfections for simultaneous T1, T2, and T1ρ relaxation mapping. Methods: We implemented a totally balanced spin-lock (TB-SL) module to encode T1ρ relaxation into an existing MRF framework that encoded T1 and T2. The spin-lock module used two 180° pulses with compensatory phases to reduce T1ρ sensitivity to B1 and B0 inhomogeneities. We compared T1ρ measured using TB-SL MRF in Bloch simulations, model agar phantoms, and in vivo experiments to those with a self-compensated spin-lock preparation module (SC-SL). The TB-SL MRF repeatability was evaluated in maps acquired in the lower leg skeletal muscle of 12 diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients, scanned two times each during visits separated by about 30 days. Results: The phantom relaxation times measured with TB-SL and SC-SL MRF were in good agreement with reference values in regions with low B1 inhomogeneities. Compared with SC-SL, TB-SL MRF showed in experiments greater robustness against severe B1 inhomogeneities and in Bloch simulations greater robustness against B1 and B0. We measured with TB-SL MRF an average T1 = 950.1 ± 28.7 ms, T2 = 26.0 ± 1.2 ms, and T1ρ = 31.7 ± 3.2 ms in skeletal muscle across patients. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated low bias between TB-SL and SC-SL MRF and between TB-SL MRF maps acquired in two visits. The coefficient of variation was less than 3% for all measurements. Conclusion: The proposed TB-SL MRF sequence is fast and insensitive to (Formula presented.) and B0 imperfections. It can simultaneously map T1, T2, T1ρ, and (Formula presented.) in a single scan and can potentially be used to study muscle composition. © 2021 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

AB  - Objective.The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the central nervous system with the rest of the body to regulate many physiological functions and is therapeutically targeted to treat diseases such as epilepsy, depression, intestinal dysmotility, chronic pain, and more. However, we still lack understanding of PNS innervation in most organs because the large span, diffuse nature, and small terminal nerve bundle fibers have precluded whole-organism, high resolution mapping of the PNS. We sought to produce a comprehensive peripheral nerve atlas for use in future interrogation of neural circuitry and selection of targets for neuromodulation.Approach.We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) with high-speed compressed sensing to generate a tractogram of the whole mouse PNS. The tractography generated from the DT-MRI data is validated using lightsheet microscopy on optically cleared, antibody stained tissue.Main results.Herein we demonstrate the first comprehensive PNS tractography in a whole mouse. Using this technique, we scanned the whole mouse in 28 h and mapped PNS innervation and fiber network in multiple organs including heart, lung, liver, kidneys, stomach, intestines, and bladder at 70µm resolution. This whole-body PNS tractography map has provided unparalleled information; for example, it delineates the innervation along the gastrointestinal tract by multiple sacral levels and by the vagal nerves. The map enabled a quantitative tractogram that revealed relative innervation of the major organs by each vertebral foramen as well as the vagus nerve.Significance.This novel high-resolution nerve atlas provides a potential roadmap for future neuromodulation therapies and other investigations into the neural circuits which drive homeostasis and disease throughout the body. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Context: Although diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is predominantly considered a disorder of the peripheral nerves, some evidence for central nervous system involvement has recently emerged. However, whether or to what extent the microstructure of central somatosensory tracts may be injured remains unknown. Objective: This work aimed to detect the microstructure of central somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients and to correlate it with the severity of DPN. Methods: A case-control study at a tertiary referral hospital took place with 57 individuals with type 2 diabetes (25 with DPN, 32 without DPN) and 33 nondiabetic controls. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of 2 major somatosensory tracts (the spinothalamic tract and its thalamocortical [spino-thalamo-cortical, STC] pathway, the medial lemniscus and its thalamocortical [medial lemnisco-thalamo-cortical, MLTC] pathway) were assessed based on diffusion tensor tractography. Regression models were further applied to detect the association of FA values with the severity of DPN in diabetic patients. Results: The mean FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly lower in patients with DPN than those without DPN and controls. Moreover, FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly associated with the severity of DPN (expressed as Toronto Clinical Scoring System values) in patients after adjusting for multiple confounders. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated the axonal degeneration of central somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients with DPN. The parallel disease progression of the intracranial and extracranial somatosensory system merits further attention to the central nerves in diabetic patients with DPN. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) has been traditionally considered as a pure disorder of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by neuropathic pain and degeneration of small-diameter nerve fibers in the skin. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed abnormal activations of pain networks, but the structural basis underlying such maladaptive functional alterations remains elusive. We applied diffusion tensor imaging to explore the influences of SFN on brain microstructures. Forty-one patients with pathology-proven SFN with reduced skin innervation were recruited. White matter connectivity with the thalamus as the seed was assessed using probabilistic tractography of diffusion tensor imaging. Patients with SFN had reduced thalamic connectivity with the insular cortex and the sensorimotor areas, including the postcentral and precentral gyri. Furthermore, the degree of skin nerve degeneration, measured by intraepidermal nerve fiber density, was associated with the reduction of connectivity between the thalamus and pain-related areas according to different neuropathic pain phenotypes, specifically, the frontal, cingulate, motor, and limbic areas for burning, electrical shocks, tingling, mechanical allodynia, and numbness. Despite altered white matter connectivity, there was no change in white matter integrity assessed with fractional anisotropy. Our findings indicate that alterations in structural connectivity may serve as a biomarker of maladaptive brain plasticity that contributes to neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve degeneration.

AB  - Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disease that results in impaired double stranded DNA repair. This leads to both increased susceptibility to various cancers, as well as hypersensitivity to radiotherapy and systemic therapy; thus, increasing the complexity of oncological treatment paradigm. Here, we present an FA patient who initially developed invasive breast cancer for which she received breast conserving treatment with no significant treatment related toxicity. This was followed by a diagnosis of high-grade ductal carcinoma-in-situ in the contralateral breast, which was managed successfully by surgery and meticulously planned adjuvant radiotherapy, with no treatment interruptions. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Introduction: In this study, we aimed to determine whether muscle transverse relaxation time (T2) magnetic resonance (MR) mapping results correlate with motor unit loss, as defined by motor unit recruitment patterns on electromyography (EMG). Methods: EMG and 3-Tesla MRI exams were acquired no more than 31 days apart in subjects referred for peripheral nerve MRI. Two musculoskeletal radiologists qualitatively graded T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequences for severity of muscle edema-like patterns and manually placed regions of interest within muscles to obtain T2 values from T2-mapping sequences. Concordance was calculated between qualitative and quantitative MR grades and EMG recruitment categories (none, discrete, decreased) as well as interobserver agreement for both MR grades. Results: Thirty-four muscles (21 abnormal, 13 control) were assessed in 13 subjects (5 females and 8 males; mean age, 46 years) with 14 EMG-MRI pairs. T2-relaxation times were significantly (P &lt;.001) increased in all EMG recruitment categories compared with control muscles. T2 differences were not significant between EMG grades of motor unit recruitment (P =.151-.702). T2 and EMG score concordance was acceptable (Harrellʼs concordance index [c index]: rater A, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.87; rater B, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-0.91). Qualitative MRI and EMG score concordance was poor to acceptable (c index: rater A, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50-0.79; rater B, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89). T2 values had moderate-to-substantial ability to distinguish between absent vs incomplete (ie, decreased or discrete) motor unit recruitment (c index: rater A, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50-1.00; rater B, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.57-1.00). Discussion: Quantitative T2 MR muscle mapping is a promising tool for noninvasive evaluation of the degree of motor unit recruitment loss. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Background: Axonal loss denervates muscle, leading to an increase of fat accumulation in the muscle. Therefore, fat fraction (FF) in whole limb muscle using MRI has emerged as a monitoring biomarker for axonal loss in patients with peripheral neuropathies. In this study, we are testing whether deep learning-based model can automate quantification of the FF in individual muscles. While individual muscle is smaller with irregular shape, manually segmented muscle MRI images have been accumulated in this lab; and make the deep learning feasible. Purpose: To automate segmentation on muscle MRI images through deep learning for quantifying individual muscle FF in patients with peripheral neuropathies. Study Type: Retrospective. Subjects: 24 patients and 19 healthy controls. Field Strength/Sequences: 3T; Interleaved 3D GRE. Assessment: A 3D U-Net model was implemented in segmenting muscle MRI images. This was enabled by leveraging a large set of manually segmented muscle MRI images. B1+ and B1− maps were used to correct image inhomogeneity. Accuracy of the automation was evaluated using Pixel Accuracy (PA), Dice Coefficient (DC) in binary masks; and Bland-Altman and Pearson correlation by comparing FF values between manual and automated methods. Statistical Tests: PA and DC were reported with their median value and standard deviation. Two methods were compared using the ± 95% confidence intervals (CI) of Bland-Altman analysis and the Pearson’s coefficient (r2). Results: DC values were from 0.83 ± 0.17 to 0.98 ± 0.02 in thigh and from 0.63 ± 0.18 to 0.96 ± 0.02 in calf muscles. For FF values, the overall ± 95% CI and r2 were [0.49, –0.56] and 0.989 in thigh and [0.84, –0.71] and 0.971 in the calf. Data Conclusion: Automated results well agreed with the manual results in quantifying FF for individual muscles. This method mitigates the formidable time consumption and intense labor in manual segmentations; and enables the use of individual muscle FF as outcome measures in upcoming longitudinal studies.

AB  - Purpose: The recently introduced inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) method has predominantly been applied for imaging the central nervous system. Future applications of ihMT, such as in peripheral nerves and muscles, will involve imaging in the vicinity of adipose tissues. This work aims to systematically investigate the partial volume effect of fat on the ihMT signal and to propose an efficient fat-separation method that does not interfere with ihMT measurements. Methods: First, the influence of fat on ihMT signal was studied using simulations. Next, the ihMT sequence was combined with a multi-echo Dixon acquisition for fat separation. The sequence was tested in 9 healthy volunteers using a 3T human scanner. The ihMT ratio (ihMTR) values were calculated in regions of interest in the brain and the spinal cord using standard acquisition (no fat saturation), water-only, in-phase, and out-of-phase reconstructions. The values obtained were compared with a standard fat suppression method, spectral presaturation with inversion recovery. Results: Simulations showed variations in the ihMTR values in the presence of fat, depending on the TEs used. The IhMTR values in the brain and spinal cord derived from the water-only ihMT multi-echo Dixon images were in good agreement with values from the unsuppressed sequence. The ihMT–spectral presaturation with inversion recovery combination resulted in 24%-35% lower ihMTR values compared with the standard non-fat-suppressed acquisition. Conclusion: The presence of fat within a voxel affects the ihMTR calculations. The IhMT multi-echo Dixon method does not compromise the observable ihMT effect and can potentially be used to remove fat influence in ihMT. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Copper deficiency syndrome is an underestimated cause of posterior myelitis. We describe the case of a 41-year-old woman, who developed a subacute ataxic paraparesis associated with low back pain. Her 3T spine MRI showed a thin hyperintense FS-Echo T2 longitudinally extensive lesion involving the posterior columns of the cervical cord (from C2 to C6). An extensive diagnostic work-up excluded other causes of myelopathy and blood tests pointed out hypocupremia and mild hyperzincemia. Patients affected by this rare form of oligoelement deficiency typically develop progressive posterior column dysfunction with sensory ataxia and spasticity, sometimes associated with sensori-motor polyneuropathy. Clinical and radiological characteristics of posterior myelopathy due to copper deficiency are briefly reviewed. Physicians should be aware of this condition since a prompt introduction of copper supplementation can avoid progression of the neurological damage. (www.actabiomedica.it). © Mattioli 1885.

AB  - Background: Nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy (DN) is assumed to begin in the distal legs with a subsequent progression to hands and arms at later stages. In contrast, recent studies have found that lower limb nerve lesions in DN predominate at the proximal sciatic nerve and that, in the upper limb, nerve functions can be impaired at early stages of DN. Materials and Methods: In this prospective, single-center cross-sectional study, participants underwent diffusion-weighted 3 Tesla magnetic resonance neurography in order to calculate the sciatic nerve’s fractional anisotropy (FA), a surrogate parameter for structural nerve integrity. Results were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological assessments of the lower limb and an examination of hand function derived from the Purdue Pegboard Test. Results: Overall, 71 patients with diabetes, 11 patients with prediabetes and 25 age-matched control subjects took part in this study. In patients with diabetes, the sciatic nerve’s FA showed positive correlations with tibial and peroneal nerve conduction velocities (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and r = 0.56; p < 0.001, respectively), and tibial and peroneal nerve compound motor action potentials (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and r = 0.63; p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the sciatic nerve’s FA was correlated with the Pegboard Test results in patients with diabetes (r = 0.52; p < 0.001), prediabetes (r = 0.76; p < 0.001) and in controls (r = 0.79; p = 0.007). Conclusion: This study is the first to show that the sciatic nerve’s FA is a surrogate marker for functional and electrophysiological parameters of both upper and lower limbs in patients with diabetes and prediabetes, suggesting that nerve damage in these patients is not restricted to the level of the symptomatic limbs but rather affects the entire peripheral nervous system. © Copyright © 2021 Jende, Kender, Mooshage, Groener, Alvarez-Ramos, Kollmer, Juerchott, Hahn, Heiland, Nawroth, Bendszus, Kopf and Kurz.

AB  - Background: Detection of peripheral nerve thickening and nerve function impairment is crucial in the diagnosis and the management of leprosy. Aims and objectives: (1) To document the cross-sectional area, echotexture and blood flow of peripheral nerves in healthy controls and leprosy cases using high-resolution ultrasound, (2) to compare the sensitivities of clinical examination and high-resolution ultrasound in detecting peripheral nerve thickening in leprosy. Methods: Peripheral nerves of 30 leprosy patients and 30 age- and sex-matched controls were evaluated clinically and by high-resolution ultrasound. When the cross-sectional area of a peripheral nerve on high-resolution ultrasound in a leprosy patient was more than the calculated upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for mean for that specific nerve in controls, that particular peripheral nerve was considered to be enlarged. Results: Cross-sectional areas more than 7.1 mm2 for the radial nerve, 8.17 mm2 for ulnar, 10.17 mm2 for median, 9.50 mm2 for lateral popliteal and 11.21mm2 for the posterior tibial nerve were considered as nerve thickening on high-resolution ultrasound. High-resolution ultrasound detected 141/300 (47%) nerves enlarged in contrast to the 60 (20%) diagnosed clinically by palpation (P &lt; 0.001). Clinical examination identified thickening in 31/70 (44.3%) nerves in cases with impairment of nerve function and 29/230 (12.6%) in the absence of nerve function impairment. High-resolution ultrasound detected thickening in 50/70 (71.4%) nerves with impairment of function and in 91/230 (39.6%) nerves without any impairment of function. Limitation: A single-centre study design was the major study limitation. Conclusion: High-resolution ultrasound showed greater sensitivity than clinical examination in detecting peripheral nerve thickening in leprosy cases. High-resolution ultrasound, may therefore improve the sensitivity of the diagnostic criterion of peripheral nerve enlargement in the diagnosis and classification of leprosy. © 2021 Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology - Published by Scientific Scholar.

AB  - There are few guidelines for genetic counseling and management of pediatric cancer patients with probable cancer predisposition. In this study, we used a previously proposed patient selection tool by Jongmans and discussed the findings in regard to pediatric cancer patients we treated. Pediatric solid tumor patients who were treated in Kocaeli University Department of Pediatric Oncology were evaluated with the five main questions in Jongmans' referral tool. All of the patients and records of diagnostic imaging were examined and analyzed. One-hundred-twenty-three patients participated in the study. The most common indication for genetic counseling was ‘consanguinity of the parents’ with ‘≥2 malignancies at childhood age’ following it. Fifty-two (42.28%) patients had indication for genetic counseling. We recommend developing and using genetics counseling selection tools such as Jongmans’ which helps clinicians differentiate patients with probable cancer predisposition. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is associated with a maladaptive autoimmune response that may cause chronic pain and disability. Nerve conduction studies are the routine method performed when rheumatologists presume its presence. However, this approach is invasive, may not reveal subtle malfunctions in the early stages of the disease, and does not expose abnormalities in structures surrounding the nerves and muscles, limiting the possibility of a timely diagnosis. This work aims to present a narrative review of new technologies for the clinical assessment of peripheral neuropathy in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Through a bibliographic search carried out in five repositories, from 1990 to 2020, we identified three technologies that could detect peripheral nerve lesions and perform quantitative evaluations: (1) magnetic resonance neurography, (2) functional magnetic resonance imaging, and (3) high-resolution ultrasonography of peripheral nerves. We found these tools can overcome the main constraints imposed by the previous electrophysiologic methods, enabling early diagnosis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the added value of DWI, qualitative proton MR spectroscopy (H-MRS) and dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion (DCE-P) to conventional MRI in differentiating benign and malignant non-fatty soft tissue tumors (NFSTT). Methods: From November 2009 to August 2017, 288 patients with NFSTT that underwent conventional and advanced MRI were prospectively evaluated. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. All patients signed an informed consent. A musculoskeletal (R1) and a general (R2) radiologist classified all tumors as benign, malignant, or indeterminate according to morphologic MRI features. Then, DWI, H-MRS, and DCE-P data of indeterminate tumors were analyzed by two additional radiologists (R3 and R4). Advanced techniques were considered individually and in combination for tumor benign-malignant differentiation using histology as the gold standard. Results: There were 104 (36.1%) malignant and 184 (63.9%) benign tumors. Conventional MRI analysis classified 99 tumors for R1 and 135 for R2 as benign or malignant, an accuracy for the identification of malignancy of 87.9% for R1 and 83.7% for R2, respectively. There were 189 indeterminate tumors for R1. For these tumors, the combination of DWI and H-MRS yielded the best accuracy for malignancy identification (77.4%). DWI alone provided the best sensitivity (91.8%) while the combination of DCE-P, DWI, and H-MRS yielded the best specificity (100%). The reproducibility of the advanced imaging parameters was considered good to excellent (Kappa and ICC > 0.86). An advanced MRI evidence-based evaluation algorithm was proposed allowing to characterize 28.1 to 30.1% of indeterminate non-myxoid tumors. Conclusion: The prioritized use of advanced MRI techniques allowed to decrease by about 30% the number of non-myxoid NFSTT deemed indeterminate after conventional MRI analysis alone. Key Points: • When morphological characterization of non-fatty soft tissue tumors is possible, the diagnostic performance is high and there is no need for advanced imaging techniques. • Following morphologic analysis, advanced MRI techniques reduced by about 30% the number of non-myxoid indeterminate tumors. • DWI is the keystone of advanced imaging techniques yielding the best sensitivity (91.8%). Optimal specificity (> 90%) is obtained by a combination of advanced techniques. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate whether pretreatment magnetic resonance (MR)-based radiomics nomogram can individualize prediction of perineural invasion (PNI) status in rectal cancer (RC). Material and methods: A total of 122 RC patients with pathologically confirmed were classified as training cohort (n = 87) and test cohort (n = 35). 180 radiomics features were extracted from all lesions based on oblique axial T2WI TSE images. The dimensionality reduction and feature selection in training cohort were realized by the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. A predictive model combining radiomics features and clinical risk factors (pathological N stage, pathological LVI status) was established by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The performance of the model was assessed based on its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, nomogram, and calibration. Results: The developed radiomics nomogram that integrated the radiomics signature and clinical risk factors could provide discrimination in the training and test cohorts. The accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) for assessing PNI status were 0.82, 0.86, respectively, in the training cohort, while they were 0.71 and 0.85 in the test cohort. The goodness-of-fit of the nomogram was evaluated using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test (p = 0.52 in training cohort and p = 0.24 in test cohort). Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusion: The developed radiomics nomogram might be helpful in the individualized assessment PNI status in patients with RC. This stratification of RC patients according to their PNI status may provide the basis for individualized adjuvant therapy, especially for stage II patients. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Imaging of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has demonstrated key diffusion tensor imaging-based diffusivity alterations in the trigeminal nerve; however, imaging has primarily focused on the peripheral nerve segment because of previous limitations in reliably segmenting small fiber bundles across multiple subjects. We used Selective Automated Group Integrated Tractography to study 36 subjects with TN (right-sided pain) and 36 sex-matched controls to examine the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve [CN V]), pontine decussation (TPT), and thalamocortical fibers (S1). Gaussian process classifiers were trained by scrolling a moving window over CN V, TPT, and S1 tractography centroids. Fractional anisotropy (FA), generalized FA, radial diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity metrics were evaluated for both groups, analyzing TN vs control groups and affected vs unaffected sides. Classifiers that performed at greater-than-or-equal-to 70% accuracy were included. Gaussian process classifier consistently demonstrated bilateral trigeminal changes, differentiating them from controls with an accuracy of 80%. Affected and unaffected sides could be differentiated from each other with 75% accuracy. Bilateral TPT could be distinguished from controls with at least 85% accuracy. TPT left-right classification achieved 98% accuracy. Bilateral S1 could be differentiated from controls, where the affected S1 radial diffusivity classifier achieved 87% accuracy. This is the first TN study that combines group-wise merged tractography, machine learning classification, and analysis of the complete trigeminal pathways from the peripheral fibers to S1 cortex. This analysis demonstrates that TN is characterized by bilateral abnormalities throughout the trigeminal pathway compared with controls and abnormalities between affected and unaffected sides. This full pathway tractography study of TN demonstrates bilateral changes throughout the trigeminal pathway and changes between affected and unaffected sides.

AB  - Objective: Management of peripheral nerve injuries requires physicians to rely on qualitative measures from patient history, electromyography, and physical exam. Determining a successful nerve repair can take months to years for proximal injuries, and the resulting delays in clinical decision-making can lead to a negative impact on patient outcomes. Early identification of a failed nerve repair could prevent permanent muscle atrophy and loss of function. This study aims to test the feasibility of performing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate injury and recovery following repair of wrist trauma. We hypothesize that DTI provides a noninvasive and reliable assessment of regeneration, which may improve clinical decision-making and alter the clinical course of surgical interventions. Methods: Clinical and MRI measurements from subjects with traumatic peripheral nerve injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, and healthy control subjects were compared to evaluate the relationship between DTI metrics and injury severity. Results: Fractional anisotropy from DTI was sensitive to differences between damaged and healthy nerves, damaged and compressed nerves, and injured and healthy contralateral nerves. Longitudinal measurements in two injury subjects also related to clinical outcomes. Implications of other diffusion measures are also discussed. Interpretation: DTI is a sensitive tool for wrist nerve injuries and can be utilized for monitoring nerve recovery. Across three subjects with nerve injuries, this study has shown how DTI can detect abnormalities between injured and healthy nerves, measure recovery, and determine if re-operation was successful. Additional comparisons to carpal tunnel syndrome and healthy nerves show that DTI is sensitive to the degree of impairment. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the progression of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) in patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) versus those treated with a combination of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and MTX. Progression was measured via brain lesion count and tumor volume. Methods: This observational and prospective cohort study evaluated the outcome of SRS treatment of PCNSL in one hundred twenty-eight subjects. We analyzed baseline, prospective, and retrospective data of patients enrolled in the brain tumor registry between June 2010 and August 2017. Seventy-three patients were treated exclusively with MTX while the remaining fifty-five patients received a combination of SRS and MTX. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were established. Results: Mean survival rate for patients receiving combined SRS and MTX treatment was significantly higher (52.6 months) compared to the MTX group (19.8 months); p = 0.0029. At the 36 months follow-up, patients treated with SRS and MTX also had a lower rate of tumor progression (32.7 %) than the MTX group (95.9 %); p = 0.00192. Local tumor control was achieved in all patients treated with SRS. No clinical toxicity was observed in this group. Conclusions: Clinical results obtained from this observational study highlight the potential effectiveness of SRS in the treatment of PCNSL. Although treatment outcomes have improved in the past years, additional evidence in the clinical design of randomized trials is needed to evaluate the strength of this treatment in specific situations. © 2020

AB  - The detection sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) is dependent on diffusion times. A shorter diffusion time can increase the sensitivity to smaller length scales. However, the conventional dMRI uses the pulse gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence that probes relatively long diffusion times only. To overcome this, the oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) sequence has been developed to probe much shorter diffusion times with hardware limitations on preclinical and clinical MRI systems. The OGSE sequence has been previously used on preclinical animal MRI systems. Recently, several studies have translated the OGSE sequence to humans on clinical MRI systems and achieved new information that is invisible using conventional PGSE sequence. This paper provides an overview of the recent progress of the OGSE neuroimaging in humans, including the technical improvements in the translation of the OGSE sequence to human imaging and various applications in different neurological disorders and stroke. Some possible future directions of the OGSE sequence are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Multi-component T2 mapping using a gradient- and spin-echo (GraSE) acquisition has become standard for myelin water imaging at 3 T. Higher magnetic field strengths promise signal-to-noise ratio benefits but face specific absorption rate limits and shortened T2 times. This study investigates compartmental T2 times in vivo and addresses advantages and challenges of multi-component T2 mapping at 7 T. Methods: We acquired 3D multi-echo GraSE data in seven healthy adults at 7 T, with three subjects also scanned at 3 T. Stimulated echoes arising from B1+ inhomogeneities were accounted for by the extended phase graph (EPG) algorithm. We used the computed T2 distributions to determine T2 times that identify different water pools and assessed signal-to-noise and fit-to-noise characteristics of the signal estimation. We compared short T2 fractions and T2 properties of the intermediate water pool at 3 T and 7 T. Results: Flip angle mapping confirmed that EPG accurately determined the larger B1+ inhomogeneity at 7 T. Multi-component T2 analysis demonstrated shortened T2 times at 7 T compared with 3 T. Fit-to-noise and signal-to-noise ratios were improved at 7 T but depended on B1+ homogeneity. Adjusting the shortest T2 to 8 ms and the T2 threshold that separates different water compartments to 20 ms yielded short T2 fractions at 7 T that conformed to 3 T data. Short T2 fractions in myelin-rich white matter regions were lower at 7 T than at 3 T, and higher in iron-rich structures. Discussion: Adjusting the T2 compartment boundaries was required due to the shorter T2 relaxation times at 7 T. Shorter echo spacing would better sample the fast decaying signal but would increase peripheral nerve stimulation. Multi-channel transmission will improve T2 measurements at 7 T. Conclusion: We used a multi-echo 3D GraSE sequence to characterize the multi-exponential T2 decay at 7 T. We adapted T2 parameters for evaluation of the short T2 fraction. Obtained 7 T multi-component T2 maps were in good agreement with 3 T data. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease is diagnosed through clinical findings and genetic testing. While there are neurophysiological tools and clinical functional scales in CMT, objective disease biomarkers that can facilitate in monitoring disease progression are limited. Purpose: To investigate the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in determining the microstructural integrity of sciatic and peroneal nerves and its correlation with the MRI grading of muscle atrophy severity and clinical function in CMT as determined by the CMT neuropathy score (CMTNS). Study Type: Prospective case–control. Subjects: Nine CMT patients and nine age-matched controls. Field Strength/Sequence: 3 T T1-weighted in-/out-of phase spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) and DTI sequences. Assessment: Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD) values for sciatic and peroneal nerves were obtained from DTI. Muscle atrophy was graded according to the Goutallier classification using in-/out-of phase SPGRs. DTI parameters and muscle atrophy grades were compared between CMT and controls, and the relationship between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS were assessed. Statistical Tests: The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used to compare DTI parameters between CMT and controls. The relationship between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS were analyzed using the Spearman correlation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of DTI parameters that can differentiate CMT from healthy controls were done. Results: There was a significant reduction in FA and increase in RD of both nerves (P &lt; 0.05) in CMT, with significant correlations between FA (negative; P &lt; 0.05) and RD (positive; P &lt; 0.05) with muscle atrophy grade. In the sciatic nerve, there was significant correlation between FA and CMTNS (r = –0.795; P &lt; 0.05). FA and RD could discriminate CMT from controls with high sensitivity (77.8–100%) and specificity (88.9–100%). Data Conclusion: There were significant differences of DTI parameters between CMT and controls, with significant correlations between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grade, and CMTNS.

AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) accurately charge tRNAs with their respective amino acids. As such, they are vital for the initiation of cytosolic and mitochondrial protein translation. These enzymes have become increasingly scrutinized in recent years for their role in neurodegenerative disorders caused by the mutations of ARS-encoding genes. This review focuses on two such genes—DARS1 and DARS2—which encode cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetases, and the clinical conditions associated with mutations of these genes. We also describe attempts made at modeling these conditions in mice, which have both yielded important mechanistic insights. Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is a disease caused by a range of mutations in the DARS2 gene, initially identified in 2003. Ten years later, hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity (HBSL), caused by mutations of cytosolic DARS1, was discovered. Multiple parallels have been drawn between the two conditions. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) patterns are strikingly similar, but still set these two conditions apart from other leukodystrophies. Clinically, both conditions are characterized by lower limb spasticity, often associated with other pyramidal signs. However, perhaps due to earlier detection, a wider range of symptoms, including peripheral neuropathy, as well as visual and hearing changes have been described in LBSL patients. Both HBSL and LBSL are spectrum disorders lacking genotype to phenotype correlation. While the fatal phenotype of Dars1 or Dars2 single gene deletion mouse mutants revealed that the two enzymes lack functional redundancy, further pursuit of disease modeling are required to shed light onto the underlying disease mechanism, and enable examination of experimental treatments, including gene therapies. © Copyright © 2021 Muthiah, Housley, Klugmann and Fröhlich.

AB  - The emergence of diffusion, structural, and functional neuroimaging methods has enabled major multi-site efforts to map the human connectome, which has heretofore been defined as containing all neural connections in the central nervous system (CNS). However, these efforts are not structured to examine the richness and complexity of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which arguably forms the (neglected) rest of the connectome. Despite increasing interest in an atlas of the spinal cord (SC) and PNS which is simultaneously stereotactic, interactive, electronically dissectible, scalable, population-based and deformable, little attention has thus far been devoted to this task of critical importance. Nevertheless, the atlasing of these complete neural structures is essential for neurosurgical planning, neurological localization, and for mapping those components of the human connectome located outside of the CNS. Here we recommend a modification to the definition of the human connectome to include the SC and PNS, and argue for the creation of an inclusive atlas to complement current efforts to map the brain's human connectome, to enhance clinical education, and to assist progress in neuroscience research. In addition to providing a critical overview of existing neuroimaging techniques, image processing methodologies and algorithmic advances which can be combined for the creation of a full connectome atlas, we outline a blueprint for ultimately mapping the entire human nervous system and, thereby, for filling a critical gap in our scientific knowledge of neural connectivity. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Introduction: Cerebellar degeneration has been associated in patients with epilepsy, though the exact pathogenic mechanisms are not understood. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the prevalence of cerebellar degeneration in patients with epilepsy and identify any pathogenic mechanisms. Methodology: A systematic computer-based literature search was conducted using the PubMed database. Data extracted included prevalence, clinical, neuroradiological, and neu- ropathological characteristics of patients with epilepsy and cerebellar degeneration. Results: We identified three consistent predictors of cerebellar degeneration in the context of epilepsy in our review: Temporal lobe epilepsy, poor seizure control, and phenytoin as the treatment modality. Whole brain and hippocampal atrophy were also identified in patients with epilepsy. Conclusions: Cerebellar degeneration is prevalent in patients with epilepsy. Further prospective studies are required to confirm if the predictors identified in this review are indeed linked to cerebellar degeneration and to establish the pathogenic mechanisms that result in cerebellar insult. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the interreader and test-retest reliability of magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry in sciatic nerve MR neurography (MRN). Materials and methods: In this prospective study, 21 healthy volunteers were examined three times on separate days by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 Tesla, consisting of an MTI sequence, a multi-echo T2 relaxometry sequence, and a high-resolution T2-weighted sequence. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density (PSD) of the sciatic nerve were assessed by two independent observers, and both interreader and test-retest reliability for all readout parameters were reported by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Results: For the sciatic nerve, overall mean ± standard deviation MTR was 26.75 ± 3.5%, T2 was 64.54 ± 8.2 ms, and PSD was 340.93 ± 78.8. ICCs ranged between 0.81 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for interreader reliability and between 0.75 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for test-retest reliability. SEM for interreader reliability was 1.7% for MTR, 2.67 ms for T2, and 21.3 for PSD. SEM for test-retest reliability was 1.7% for MTR, 2.66 ms for T2, and 20.1 for PSD. Conclusions: MTI and T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve are reliable and reproducible. The values of measurement imprecision reported here may serve as a guide for correct interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies. Key Points: • Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve are reliable and reproducible. • The imprecision that is unavoidably associated with different scans or different readers can be estimated by the here presented SEM values for the biomarkers T2, PSD, and MTR. • These values may serve as a guide for correct interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies and possible clinical applications. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the common peripheral neuropathies. For magnetic resonance imaging, segmentation of the carpal tunnel and its contents, including flexor tendons and the median nerve for magnetic resonance images is an important issue. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which was modified by the original DeepLabv3 + model to segment three primary structures of the carpal tunnel: the carpal tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve. Methods: To extract important feature maps for segmentation of the carpal tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve, the proposed CNN model termed modified DeepLabv3 + uses DenseNet-121 as a backbone and adds dilated convolution to the original spatial pyramid pooling module. A MaskTrack method was used to refine the segmented results generated by modified DeepLabv3 + , which have a small and blurred appearance. For evaluation of the segmentation results, the average Dice similarity coefficients (ADSC) were used as the performance index. Results: Sixteen MR images corresponding to different subjects were obtained from the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Our proposed modified DeepLabv3 + generated the following ADSCs: 0.928 for carpal tunnel, 0.872 for flexor tendons and 0.785 for the median nerve. The ADSC value of 0.8053 generated the MaskTrack that 0.22 ADSC measure were improved for measuring the median nerve. Conclusions: The experimental results showed that the proposed modified DeepLabv3 + model can promote segmentations of the carpal tunnel and its contents. The results are superior to the results generated by original DeepLabv3 +. Additionally, MaskTrack can also effectively refine median nerve segmentations. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: AGel amyloidosis is systemic amyloidosis caused by pathogenic variants in the GSN gene. In this study, we sought to characterize the clinical and brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) features of Korean patients with AGel amyloidosis. Materials and Methods: We examined 13 patients with AGel amyloidosis from three unrelated families. Brain MRIs were performed in eight patients and eight age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Therein, we analyzed gray and white matter content using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and FreeSurfer. Results: The median age at examination was 73 (interquartile range: 64–76) years. The median age at onset of cutis laxa was 20 (interquartile range: 15–30) years. All patients over that age of 60 years had dysarthria, cutis laxa, dysphagia, and facial palsy. Two patients in their 30s had only mild cutis laxa. The median age at dysarthria onset was 66 (interquartile range: 63.5–70) years. Oph-thalmoparesis was observed in three patients. No patient presented with muscle weakness of the limbs. Axial fluid-attenuated in-version recovery images of the brain showed no significant differences between the patient and control groups. Also, analysis of VBM, TBSS, and FreeSurfer revealed no significant differences in cortical thickness between patients and healthy controls at the corrected significance level. Conclusion: Our study outlines the clinical manifestations of prominent bulbar palsy and early-onset cutis laxa in 13 Korean patients with AGel amyloidosis and confirms that AGel amyloidosis mainly affects the peripheral nervous system rather than the central nervous system. © Yonsei University College of Medicine 2021.

AB  - Objective Thalamus is essential in processing of sensory information. This study explored the associations between thalamic volume and intra-Thalamic metabolites and associations to clinical and experimental characteristics of sensory function in adults with diabetic polyneuropathy. Methods 48 adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy (DPSN) and 28 healthy controls participated in a cross-sectional study and underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Estimates for thalamic volume were extracted using voxel-based morphometry and intra-Thalamic N-Acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/cre) levels were assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Associations between thalamic volume and clinical measures, quantitative sensory testing and neuropathic phenotype were explored. Results In diabetes, reduced gray matter volume was identified including bilateral thalamus (all p≤0.001) in comparison to healthy participants. Thalamic volume estimates were positively associated to intra-Thalamic NAA/cre (r=0.4; p=0.006), however not to diabetes duration (p=0.5), severity of DSPN (p=0.7), or presence of pain (p=0.3). Individuals with the lowest thalamic volume had greatest loss of protective sensation (light touch using von Frey-like filaments, p=0.037) and highest pain tolerance to electric stimulation (tetanic stimulation, p=0.008) compared to individuals with the highest thalamic volume. Conclusions In this cohort with type 1 diabetes and severe DSPN, thalamic atrophy was present and associated with reduced NAA/cre, indicating thalamic structural loss and dysfunction. Thalamic atrophy was associated to reduced sensory function involving large fiber neuropathy and sensation to tetanic stimulation that may reflect synaptic transmission. This may ultimately contribute to the current understanding of the pathophysiology behind the perception changes evident in DSPN. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rationale: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a great challenge for regenerative medicine. Nerve autograft is the gold standard for clinical PNI repair. Due to its significant drawbacks, artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) have drawn much attention as replacement therapies. We developed a combinatorial NGC consisting of longitudinally aligned electrospun nanofibers and porcine decellularized nerve matrix hydrogel (pDNM gel). The in vivo capacity for facilitating nerve tissue regeneration and functional recovery was evaluated in a rat sciatic nerve defect model. Methods: Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) was electrospun into randomly oriented (PLLA-random) and longitudinally aligned (PLLA-aligned) nanofibers. PLLA-aligned were further coated with pDNM gel at concentrations of 0.25% (PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel) and 1% (PLLA-aligned/1% pDNM gel). Axonal extension and Schwann cells migration were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining of dorsal root ganglia cultured on the scaffolds. To fabricate implantable NGCs, the nanofibrous scaffolds were rolled and covered with an electrospun protection tube. The fabricated NGCs were then implanted into a 5 mm sciatic nerve defect model in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Nerves treated with NGCs were compared to contralateral uninjured nerves (control group), injured but untreated nerves (unstitched group), and autografted nerves. Nerve regeneration was monitored by an established set of assays, including T2 values and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histological assessments, and immunostaining. Nerve functional recovery was evaluated by walking track analysis. Results: PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel scaffold exhibited the best performance in facilitating directed axonal extension and Schwann cells migration in vitro due to the combined effects of the topological cues provided by the aligned nanofibers and the biochemical cues retained in the pDNM gel. Consistent results were obtained in animal experiments with the fabricated NGCs. Both the T2 and fractional anisotropy values of the PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel group were the closest to those of the autografted group, and returned to normal much faster than those of the other NGCs groups. Histological assessment indicated that the implanted PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel NGC resulted in the largest number of axons and the most extensive myelination among all fabricated NGCs. Further, the PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel group exhibited the highest sciatic nerve function index, which was comparable to that of the autografted group, at 8 weeks post-surgery. Conclusions: NGCs composed of aligned PLLA nanofibers decorated with 0.25% pDNM gel provided both topological and biochemical guidance for directing and promoting axonal extension, nerve fiber myelination, and functional recovery. Moreover, T2-mapping and DTI metrics were found to be useful non-invasive monitoring techniques for PNI treatment. © 2020 The author(s).

AB  - Objective: Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by deficient activity of arylsulfatase A (ASA), resulting in severe motor and cognitive dysfunction. This phase 1/2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) recombinant human ASA (rhASA; HGT-1111, previously known as Metazym) in children with MLD. Methods: Thirteen children with MLD (symptom onset < 4 years of age) were enrolled in an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation trial and received IV rhASA at 50, 100, or 200 U/kg body weight every 14 (± 4) days for 52 weeks (NCT00418561; NCT00633139). Eleven children continued to receive rhASA at 100 or 200 U/kg during a 24-month extension period (NCT00681811). Outcome measures included safety observations, changes in motor and cognitive function, and changes in nerve conduction and morphometry. Results: There were no serious adverse events considered related to IV rhASA. Motor function and developmental testing scores declined during the study in all dose groups; no significant differences were observed between groups. Nerve conduction studies and morphometric analysis indicated that peripheral nerve pathology did not worsen during the study in any dose group. Interpretation: IV rhASA was generally well tolerated. There was no evidence of efficacy in preventing motor and cognitive deterioration, suggesting that IV rhASA may not cross the blood–brain barrier in therapeutic quantities. The relative stability of peripheral nerve function during the study indicates that rhASA may be beneficial if delivered to the appropriate target site and supports the development of rhASA for intrathecal administration in MLD. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Background and purpose: We quantified peripheral nerve lesions in adults with 5q-linked spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3 by analysing the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of the sciatic nerve, and tested its potential as a novel biomarker for macromolecular changes. Methods: Eighteen adults with SMA 3 (50% SMA 3a, 50% SMA 3b) and 18 age-/sex-matched healthy controls prospectively underwent magnetization transfer contrast imaging in a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance scanner. Two axial three-dimensional gradient echo sequences, with and without an off-resonance saturation rapid frequency pulse, were performed at the right distal thigh. Sciatic nerve regions of interest were manually traced on 10 consecutive axial slices in the images generated without off-resonance saturation, and then transferred to corresponding slices generated by the sequence with the off-resonance saturation pulse. Subsequently, MTR and cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of the sciatic nerve were analysed. In addition, detailed neurologic, physiotherapeutic and electrophysiologic examinations were conducted in all patients. Results: Sciatic nerve MTR and CSA reliably differentiated between healthy controls and SMA 3, 3a or 3b. MTR was lower in the SMA 3 (P < 0.0001), SMA 3a (P < 0.0001) and SMA 3b groups (P = 0.0020) than in respective controls. In patients with SMA 3, MTR correlated with all clinical scores, and arm nerve compound motor action potentials (CMAPs). CSA was lower in the SMA 3 (P < 0.0001), SMA 3a (P < 0.0001) and SMA 3b groups (P = 0.0006) than in controls, but did not correlate with clinical scores or electrophysiologic results. Conclusions: Magnetization transfer ratio is a novel imaging marker that quantifies macromolecular nerve changes in SMA 3, and positively correlates with clinical scores and CMAPs. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) characterises tissue microstructure and provides proxy measures of myelination, axon diameter, fibre density and organisation. This may be valuable in the assessment of the roots of the brachial plexus in health and disease. Therefore, there is a need to define the normal DTI values. Methods: The literature was systematically searched for studies of asymptomatic adults who underwent DTI of the brachial plexus. Participant characteristics, scanning protocols, and measurements of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of each spinal root were extracted by two independent review authors. Generalised linear modelling was used to estimate the effect of experimental conditions on the FA and MD. Meta-analysis of root-level estimates was performed using Cohen’s method with random effects. Results: Nine articles, describing 316 adults (1:1 male:female) of mean age 35 years (SD 6) were included. Increments of ten diffusion sensitising gradient directions reduced the mean FA by 0.01 (95% CI 0.01, 0.03). Each year of life reduced the mean MD by 0.03 × 10–3 mm2/s (95% CI 0.01, 0.04). At 3-T, the pooled mean FA of the roots was 0.36 (95% CI 0.34, 0.38; I2 98%). The pooled mean MD of the roots was 1.51 × 10–3 mm2/s (95% CI 1.45, 1.56; I2 99%). Conclusions: The FA and MD of the roots of the brachial plexus vary according to experimental conditions and participant factors. We provide summary estimates of the normative values in different conditions which may be valuable to researchers and clinicians alike. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) has been used extensively to study pathological conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, tissue damage is assessed qualitatively with little information regarding the underlying pathophysiological processes involved. Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging method which is sensitive to tissue macromolecular content and may therefore have an important role in the study of pathologies affecting the PNS. This study explored the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus of healthy volunteers using MRN to identify and segment each lumbar segment (L2–L5) and regions (preganglionic, ganglionic and postganglionic). Reproducibility of the MTR measurements and of the segmentation method were assessed from repeated measurements (scan-rescan), and from the reanalysis of images (intra- and inter-rater assessment), by calculating the coefficient of variation (COV). In all segments combined (L2–L5), mean (± SD) MTR was 30.5 (± 2.4). Scan-rescan, intra- and inter-rater COV values were 3.2%, 4.4% and 5.3%, respectively. One-way analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference in MTR between the preganglionic and postganglionic regions in all lumbar segments. This pilot study in healthy volunteers demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus, opening up the possibility of studying a broad spectrum of neurological conditions in vivo. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is caused by drug-induced damage to the axons which is not detected easily due to lack of reliable, clinically applicable modalities. Diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) allows for quantitative measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which have been shown to detect nerve injury by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Methods: We sought to evaluate if DTI could be used for detection of CIPN in patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane. Patients with h/o exposure to neurotoxic chemotherapy, diabetes, or peripheral neuropathy were excluded. Patients completed pre- and post-chemotherapy MRI of bilateral legs and FACT&GOG-Ntx. Genotyping of single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) was performed to detect known associations with CIPN. Results: We had 14 evaluable patients in this prospective trial. Mean FA values post-chemotherapy were significantly lower than baseline at mid-calf (p < 0.0001) and ankle (p = 0.03). We did not find any significant change in mean ADC values. In patients without symptomatic neuropathy, mean FA values decreased more than symptomatic patients at mid-calf (p < 0.001). Of the 41 genotyped SNVs, only rs8110536 was found to be significantly associated with development of CIPN. Conclusions: Our results show that FA values are indicative of CIPN and differential changes in FA values in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients highlights its potential to be further studied as a predictive biomarker for CIPN. This is the first study to highlight a non-invasive, imaging based, objective biomarker which, if validated, can be translated into clinic easily. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Neurologic complications in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been described, but the understanding of their pathophysiologic causes and neuroanatomical correlates remains limited. Purpose: To report on the frequency and type of neuroradiological findings in COVID-19. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, all consecutive adult hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who underwent neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May 24, 2020, were included. All examinations were systematically re-evaluated by 12 readers. Summary descriptive statistics were calculated. Results: A total of 185 patients with COVID-19 (62 years ± 14 [standard deviation]; 138 men) underwent neuroimaging. In total, 222 brain CT, 47 brain MRI, and seven spinal MRI examinations were performed. Intra-axial susceptibility abnormalities were the most common finding (29 of 39; 74%, 95% CI: 58, 87) in patients who underwent brain MRI, often with an ovoid shape suggestive of microvascular pathology and with a predilection for the corpus callosum (23 of 39; 59%; 95% CI: 42, 74) and juxtacortical areas (14 of 39; 36%; 95% CI: 21, 53). Ischemic and macrohemorrhagic manifestations were also observed, but vascular imaging did not demonstrate overt abnormalities. Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 19 patients did not reveal consistent asymmetries between hemispheres or regions. Many patients (18 of 41; 44%; 95% CI: 28, 60) had leukoencephalopathy and one patient had a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum. Other findings included olfactory bulb signal abnormalities (seven of 37; 19%), prominent optic nerve subarachnoid spaces (20 of 36; 56%), and enhancement of the parenchyma (three of 20; 15%), leptomeninges (three of 20; 15%), cranial nerves (two of 20; 10%), and spinal nerves (two of four; 50%). At MRI follow-up, regression of leukoencephalopathy and progressive leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in one patient each, respectively, which is suggestive of dynamic processes. Conclusion: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 had a wide spectrum of vascular and inflammatory involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system. © RSNA, 2020.

AB  - Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome, affecting a large proportion of the general population. Genetic susceptibility has been implicated in CTS, but the causative genes remain elusive. Here, we report the identification of two mutations in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) that segregate with CTS in two large families with or without multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED). Both mutations impair the secretion of COMP by tenocytes, but the mutation associated with MED also perturbs its secretion in chondrocytes. Further functional characterization of the CTS-specific mutation reveals similar histological and molecular changes of tendons/ligaments in patients’ biopsies and the mouse models. The mutant COMP fails to oligomerize properly and is trapped in the ER, resulting in ER stress-induced unfolded protein response and cell death, leading to inflammation, progressive fibrosis and cell composition change in tendons/ligaments. The extracellular matrix (ECM) organization is also altered. Our studies uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism in CTS pathogenesis. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the evaluation of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) compared to clinical scores and nerve conduction studies (NCS). Patients and methods: We included 30 patients with diabetes mellitus complaining of neuropathy symptoms and 15 healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent evaluation using 1.5-T DTI of median nerves and NCS. Patients underwent clinical evaluation using the Neuropathy Deficit Score (NDS), Neuropathy Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL), and Diabetic Neuropathy Examination (DNE) score. Results: We found statistically significant differences between healthy volunteers and patients in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the distal segment (P = 0.016) and whole median nerve (P = 0.024), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of proximal (P = 0.027) and distal (P < 0.001) segments, and whole median nerve (P = 0.019). Distal segment FA was significantly correlated with NDS (P = 0.003), DNEs (P = 0.003), sensory amplitude (P = 0.048), and motor CV (P = 0.020). Distal segment ADC was significantly correlated with NDS (P = 0.007), NIS-LL (P = 0.003), DNEs (P = 0.01), and sensory amplitude (P = 0.032). The best cut-off value of distal segment for FA was 0.45 (87% sensitivity, 80% specificity) and of distal segment ADC was 1.217 (80% sensitivity and specificity). Conclusions: Our results suggest that 1.5-T DTI examination of the median nerve can provide useful non-invasive information in patients with DPN. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03934970.

AB  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is increasingly being used in magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). The purpose of this study was to determine the interreader and test-retest reliability of peripheral nerve DTI in MRN with focus on the sciatic nerve. Methods: In this prospective study 27 healthy volunteers each underwent 3 scans of a short DTI protocol on separate days consisting of a T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and single-shot DTI sequence of the sciatic nerve of the dominant leg. The DTI parameters fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were obtained after manual nerve segmentation by two independent readers. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and Bland-Altman plots were calculated as measures for both interreader and test-retest agreement for all readout parameters. Results: The mean ± standard deviation was 0.507 ± 0.05 for FA, 1308.5 ± 162.4 × 10−6 mm2/s for MD, 905.6 ± 145.4 ×10−6 mm2/s for RD and 2114.1 ± 219.2 × 10−6 mm2/s for AD. The SEM for FA was 0.02 for interreader and test-retest agreement, the SEM for MD, RD, and AD ranged between 46.2 × 10−6 mm2/s (RD) and 70.1 × 10−6 mm2/s (AD) for interreader reliability and between 45.9 × 10−6 mm2/s (RD) and 70.1 × 10−6 mm2/s (AD) for test-retest reliability. The ICC for interreader reliability of DTI parameters ranged between 0.81 and 0.92 and ICC for test-retest reliability between 0.76 and 0.91. Conclusion: Peripheral nerve DTI of the sciatic nerve is reliable and reproducible. The measures presented here may serve as first orientation values of measurement accuracy when interpreting parameters of sciatic nerve DTI. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: To determine normative morphological and functional magnetic resonance (MR) neurography values in children and adolescents in correlation to demographic determinants. Methods: In this study 29 healthy underage subjects (mean age 13.9 years, range 10–17 years) were examined using a standardized MR neurography protocol of the lumbosacral plexus and the right lower extremity at 3 T. Volumes of the dorsal root ganglia L3–S2, cross-sectional area of the sciatic and tibial nerves, as well as T2-weighted contrast nerve-muscle ratio and quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) values of the sciatic nerve were obtained and correlated with the demographic parameters sex, age, height and weight. Results: While all obtained morphological and functional MR neurography values did not differ between male and female sex, dorsal root ganglia volume, sciatic and tibial nerve cross-sectional area correlated positively with age, height, and weight. The T2-weighted signal of the sciatic nerve was independent of demographic determinants. Negative correlation was found for fractional anisotropy (FA) with age, height, and weight, whereas radial diffusivity (RD) showed a positive correlation only with age. Mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) revealed no correlation with demographic determinants. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that selection of sex-matched controls for further studies assessing peripheral nerve pathologies in underage patients may not be necessary; however, control subjects should be adapted to age, height, and weight of the patient population, especially if assessing dorsal root ganglia volume, nerve cross-sectional area and DTI. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: We examined the chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) patients and non-CIDP patients who have similar symptoms and difficult to differential diagnosis with CIDP by magnetic resonance neurography to find the difference among them. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differential diagnostic value of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) for CIDP and other peripheral neuropathies. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Thirty-two consecutive patients with CIDP and 22 non-CIDP patients with symptoms similar to CIDP and difficult to be discriminate were recruited and imaged as a control group between May 2017 and May 2019. METHODS: In this prospective study, the brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus of 32 CIDP patients and 22 non-CIDP patients were examined by MRN. The clinical features and the nerve roots cross-sectional area (CSA) of the brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus were measured. RESULTS: The CSA of nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1 and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes syndrome patients were all shown extensive by MRN. The sensitivity of MRN in diagnosing CIDP was 81.25% (26/32), the specificity was 68.18% (15/22), the positive predictive value was 78.79% (26/33), the negative predictive value was 71.43% (15/21), the accuracy was 75.93% (40/54), the misdiagnosis rate was 24.07% (13/54), and the kappa value was 0.498. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for CIDP with the CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.762) and that of the brachial plexus (AUC = 0.762), and the combined of both examinations did not improve the diagnostic efficacy compared with either (AUC = 0.769). CONCLUSIONS: The nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1, and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes syndrome were difficult to distinguish by MRN. Atypical CIDP patients had less nerve root injury compared with typical CIDP patients. MRN of either the brachial plexus or the lumbosacral plexus had a high diagnostic accuracy for CIDP, and it is not necessary to perform both parts of the examination.2.

AB  - Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe and yet most poorly understood complications of diabetes mellitus. In vivo imaging of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a key structure for the understanding of DPN, has been restricted to animal studies. These have shown a correlation of decreased DRG volume with neuropathic symptom severity. Our objective was to investigate correlations of DRG morphology and signal characteristics at 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) with clinical and serological data in diabetic patients with and without DPN. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent 3T MRN of both L5 DRG using an isotropic 3D T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence with subsequent segmentation of DRG volume and analysis of normalized signal properties. Overall, 55 diabetes patients (66 ± 9 years; 32 men; 30 with DPN) took part in this study. DRG volume was smaller in patients with severe DPN when compared to patients with mild or moderate DPN (134.7 ± 21.86 vs 170.1 ± 49.22; p = 0.040). In DPN patients, DRG volume was negatively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r = −0.43; 95%CI = −0.66 to −0.14; p = 0.02), a measure of neuropathy severity. DRG volume showed negative correlations with triglycerides (r = −0.40; 95%CI = −0.57 to −0.19; p = 0.006), and LDL cholesterol (r = −0.33; 95%CI = −0.51 to −0.11; p = 0.04). There was a strong positive correlation of normalized MR signal intensity (SI) with the neuropathy symptom score in the subgroup of patients with painful DPN (r = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.46 to 0.93; p = 0.005). DRG SI was positively correlated with HbA1c levels (r = 0.30; 95%CI = 0.09 to 0.50; p = 0.03) and the triglyceride/HDL ratio (r = 0.40; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.57; p = 0.007). In this first in vivo study, we found DRG morphological degeneration and signal increase in correlation with neuropathy severity. This elucidates the potential importance of MR-based DRG assessments in studying structural and functional changes in DPN. © Copyright © 2020 Jende, Kender, Rother, Alvarez-Ramos, Groener, Pham, Morgenstern, Oikonomou, Hahn, Juerchott, Kollmer, Heiland, Kopf, Nawroth, Bendszus and Kurz.

AB  - EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) is a preferred regimen for HIV-non-Hodgkin lymphomas (HIV-NHLs), which are frequently Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive or human herpesvirus type-8 (HHV-8) positive. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat disrupts EBV/HHV-8 latency, enhances chemotherapy-induced cell death, and may clear HIV reservoirs. We performed a randomized phase 2 study in 90 patients (45 per study arm) with aggressive HIV-NHLs, using dose-adjusted EPOCH (plus rituximab if CD201), alone or with 300 mg vorinostat, administered on days 1 to 5 of each cycle. Up to 1 prior cycle of systemic chemotherapy was allowed. The primary end point was complete response (CR). In 86 evaluable patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n 5 61), plasmablastic lymphoma (n 5 15), primary effusion lymphoma (n 5 7), unclassifiable B-cell NHL (n 5 2), and Burkitt lymphoma (n 5 1), CR rates were 74% vs 68% for EPOCH vs EPOCH-vorinostat (P 5.72). Patients with a CD41 count &lt;200 cells/mm3 had a lower CR rate. EPOCH-vorinostat did not eliminate HIV reservoirs, resulted in more frequent grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and did not affect survival. Overall, patients with Myc1 DLBCL had a significantly lower EFS. A low diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) was also associated with inferior outcomes, whereas preprotocol therapy had no negative impact. In summary, EPOCH had broad efficacy against highly aggressive HIV-NHLs, whereas vorinostat had no benefit; patients with Myc-driven DLBCL, low CD4, and low DTI had less favorable outcomes. Permitting preprotocol therapy facilitated accruals without compromising outcomes. © 2020 American Society of Hematology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Central nervous system involvement has been described in peripheral neuropathies, including different forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The aim of our study was to systematically investigate possible brain structural modifications in CMT1A patients, using volumetric MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this prospective cross-sectional study, from May 2017 to May 2019, we acquired 3T MRI brain scans of genetically confirmed CMT1A patients and age- and sex-comparable healthy controls. Patients also underwent clinical and electrophysiological examinations assessing motor and sensory domains. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were performed using a non-parametric approach based on permutations, including age and sex (and total intracranial volume for VBM) as nuisance covariates. When between-group differences emerged at VBM or TBSS analyses, the first eigenvariate was extracted from the cluster and its age- and sex-adjusted standardized residuals tested for correlation with clinical and electrophysiological variables. Twenty CMT1A patients (34.5 ± 11.1 years; M/F:11/9) were enrolled, along with 20 healthy controls (30.1 ± 10.2 years; M/F:11/9). The VBM analysis revealed clusters of significantly increased GM volume in CMT1A patients compared to healthy controls, encompassing the bilateral cerebellar lobules III-VI and the left hippocampus (all ps = 0.04), with no differences in terms of DTI metrics at the TBSS analysis. A negative correlation (r = −0.502, p = 0.03) emerged between ulnar compound motor action potential and the z-scores corresponding to the right cerebellar cluster of augmented GM volume. Our data show evidence of structural reorganization in the brain of CMT1A patients, possibly reflecting neural plasticity mechanisms in response to peripheral nerve pathology and modulating the effect of axonal degeneration on functional impairment. © Copyright © 2020 Pontillo, Dubbioso, Cocozza, Tozza, Severi, Iodice, Tedeschi, Elefante, Brunetti, Manganelli and Quarantelli.

AB  - Objective: Sphingolipids are enriched in the nerves. Serine-palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the key step of sphingolipids biosynthesis. Mutations in SPT subunits (SPTLC) lead to the excessive production of neurotoxic deoxysphingolipids (DoxSLs) in patients with Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy Type-1C (HSN1C). HSN1C is an autosomal dominant peripheral neuropathy characterized by sensory loss and distal muscle weakness. In this study, by leveraging a HSN1C family with a previously reported N177D mutation in SPTLC2, we aim to further define the spectrum of DoxSL species and the peripheral neve pathology of the disease. Methods: Next-generation sequencing along with Sanger confirmation was performed for family members and healthy controls. LC-MS was used for lipidomic analysis in participants’ plasma. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) was performed to study sciatic nerve pathologies. Results: A heterozygous N177D mutation in SPTLC2 was co-segregated in individuals with sensory-motor deficits in the limbs. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) revealed nonuniform slowing of conduction velocities. In line with the NCS, qMRI detected a pattern of nerve changes similar to those in acquired demyelinating polyneuropathies. Additionally, we detected a significant increase in multiple species of deoxysphingoid bases and deoxyceramides in patients’ plasma. Interpretation: Mutations in the SPTLC2 cause a demyelinating phenotype resembling those in acquired demyelinating polyneuropathy. The species of increased DoxSLs in HSN1C may be more diverse than originally thought. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a treatable, immune-mediated condition characterised by progressive or relapsing motor and sensory neurological deficits. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, neurophysiological and supportive criteria, but can be challenging. In this study, we quantified the diameter and cross-sectional area of the lumbosacral nerve roots, and explored the imaging characteristics of the sciatic nerves, in patients with CIDP versus healthy controls using MRI. Methods: MRI of the lumbosacral plexus and both thighs was performed at 3 T. Orthogonal diameter and cross-sectional area of the lumbosacral nerve roots were measured, along with sciatic nerve cross-sectional area at the mid-thigh level. The MRI appearance of the sciatic nerves was also evaluated qualitatively. All measurements were performed by an observer blinded to the diagnosis. Results: 10 patients with CIDP and 10 healthy controls (age and sex-matched) were studied. Lumbosacral nerve root diameter and cross-sectional area were significantly increased in patients with CIDP compared to controls (mean diameter 6.0 ± 1.1 mm vs 4.8 ± 0.3 mm; p = 0.006), with a high sensitivity (89 %) and specificity (90 %) on ROC analysis. Sciatic nerve cross sectional area was also significantly increased in the CIDP group, and was accompanied by qualitative MRI changes. Conclusions: Quantitative MRI reveals significant hypertrophy of the lumbosacral nerve roots and sciatic nerves in patients with CIDP compared to controls. This study provides further evidence for the inclusion of lumbosacral nerve root and sciatic nerve hypertrophy on MRI as a supportive feature in the diagnostic criteria for CIDP. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The genetic component of multiple sclerosis (MS) is now set to 200 autosomal common variants. However, it is unclear how genetic knowledge be clinically used in the differential diagnosis between MS and other inflammatory conditions like adult-onset postinfectious neurological syndromes (PINS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether PINS and MS have a shared genetic background using an updated polygenic risk scores. Methods: Eighty-eight PINS patients have been consecutively recruited between 1996 and 2016 at Mondino Foundation of Pavia, diagnosed according to clinical, MRI and CSF findings and followed-up for several years. Patients were typed using Illumina array, and genotypes imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. A weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) has been calculated based on autosomal MS risk loci derived from large-scale studies, and an HLA genetic burden (HLAGB) was also calculated on loci associated to MS. Results: PINS occurred as an episode of myelitis in 44% of patients, encephalomyelitis in 44%, and encephalitis in remaining cases, with an involvement of peripheral nervous system in 41% of patients. Mean age of onset was 50.1 years, and female:male ratio was 1.4. Patients were followed-up for a mean of 7.2 years, and at last visit 55% had a low disability grade (mRS 0–1). Disease was monophasic in 67% of patients, relapsing in 18% and chronic-progressive in 15%. The wGRS of PINS cases was comparable to 370 healthy controls, while significantly lower compared to 907 bout-onset MS (BOMS) cases (wGRS= 20.9 vs 21.2; p<0.0001). The difference was even larger for PINS with peripheral nervous system involvement (wGRS=20.6) vs BOMS. Conclusion: The distinction between MS and PINS is not easy to make in clinical practice. However, our study shows that the new set of MS risk alleles does not confer increased susceptibility to PINS. These data support the importance to discriminate these cases from MS with pathophysiological and therapeutic implications. © 2020

AB  - We systematically identified and reviewed 29 studies of peripheral nerve ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRN) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The majority of the ultrasound studies reported smaller nerves and nerve roots in ALS compared to healthy controls, but there was a large overlap of the cross-sectional nerve area between ALS and controls. Most of the MRN studies confirmed nerve abnormalities demonstrating slight T2 hyperintensities and, sometimes, mild enlargement of more proximal nerve segments (plexus, roots) in ALS. The size of the proximal nerve segments, i.e. nerve roots, is thus somewhat incongruent between nerve ultrasound and MRN in ALS. Peripheral nerve ultrasound has the potential to differentiate between ALS and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) in that patients with MMN have significantly larger nerves. Conversely, there is an overlap of MRN abnormalities in ALS and MMN, restricting the techniques’ utility in the clinical setting. A subgroup of patients with ALS seems to reveal a sonographic nerve pattern suggesting peripheral nerve inflammation. In the future, combined imaging with nerve ultrasound and MRN assessing parameters such as blood flow or textural markers may aid in the understanding of the deep nerve microstructure down to the fascicle level, and thus, in the classification of the nerve state as more degenerative or more inflammatory in ALS. This systematic review provides evidence that nerve imaging abnormalities are common in ALS. © 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology

AB  - Objective: Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is caused by a heterozygous deletion of peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene resulting in focal sensorimotor deficits. Our lab has identified a disruption of myelin junctions in excessively permeable myelin that impairs action potential propagation. This mechanism is expected to cause fatigue in patients with HNPP. Therefore, the objective was to characterize fatigue in patients with HNPP and determine the relationship of fatigue to nerve pathology, disability, and quality of life. Methods: Nine females with HNPP participated in a single visit that included genotyping, nerve conduction studies, neurological exam, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, and a physical therapy exam incorporating upper and lower extremity function and survey measures of fatigue. This visit was followed by 2 weeks of ecological momentary assessment (wrist-worn device) that captured fatigue ratings five times per day. Results: Participants demonstrated mild neurological impairment (CMTNS: 5.7 ± 2.8), yet reported high fatigue levels (average fatigue intensity over 2 weeks: 5.9 out of 10). Higher fatigue levels were associated with poorer quality of life and more pain. Higher fatigue was associated with significantly greater distal nerve proton density changes on peripheral nerve MRI, which is in line with hyper-permeable myelin in HNPP. Interpretation: Fatigue is common and severe among patients with HNPP whose disabilities are minimal by conventional outcome measures. Therapeutic interventions targeting fatigue have the potential to improve quality of life and may serve as a robust outcome measure to show longitudinal changes for patients with HNPP. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA), also known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome, is characterised by sudden pain attacks, followed by patchy muscle paresis in the upper extremity. Recent reports have shown that incidence is much higher than previously assumed and that the majority of patients never achieve full recovery. Traditionally, the diagnosis was mainly based on clinical observations and treatment options were confined to application of corticosteroids and symptomatic management, without proven positive effects on long-term outcomes. These views, however, have been challenged in the last years. Improved imaging methods in MRI and high-resolution ultrasound have led to the identification of structural peripheral nerve pathologies in NA, most notably hourglass-like constrictions. These pathognomonic findings have paved the way for more accurate diagnosis through high-resolution imaging. Furthermore, surgery has shown to improve clinical outcomes in such cases, indicating the viability of peripheral nerve surgery as a valuable treatment option in NA. In this review, we present an update on the current knowledge on this disease, including pathophysiology and clinical presentation, moving on to diagnostic and treatment paradigms with a focus on recent radiological findings and surgical reports. Finally, we present a surgical treatment algorithm to support clinical decision making, with the aim to encourage translation into day-to-day practice. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of fiber tractography and diffusivity analysis generated from 3D diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences for preoperative assessment of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Method: MR imaging at 3 T was performed in 22 patients (mean age 41.9 ± 17.1y, 13 women) with histologically confirmed schwannomas (N = 18) and histologically confirmed neurofibromas (N = 11), including a 3D DW turbo spin echo sequence with fat suppression. Diffusion tensor parameters were computed and fiber tracks were determined. Evaluation was performed by two radiologists and one orthopedic surgeon blinded for final diagnosis. Mean diffusivity was computed to allow further assessment of tumor microstructure. Preoperative fascicle visualization was graded, fascicles were categorized regarding anatomical location and amount of fascicles surrounding the tumor. The agreement of imaging findings with intraoperative findings was assessed. Results: On 78.3 % of the DTI images, the fascicle visualization was rated as good or very good. Tractography differences were observed in schwannomas and neurofibromas, showing schwannomas to be significantly more often located eccentrically to the nerve (94.8 %) than neurofibromas (0 %, P &lt; 0.01). Fascicles were significantly more often continuous (87.5 %) in schwannomas, while in neurofibromas, none of the tracks was graded to be continuous (0 %, P = 0.014). A substantial agreement between fiber tracking and surgical anatomy was found regarding the fascicle courses surrounding the tumor (κ = 0.78). Mean diffusivity of schwannomas (1.5 ± 0.2 × 10−3 mm2/s) was significantly lower than in neurofibromas (1.8 ± 0.2 × 10−3 mm2/s; P &lt; 0.001). The Youden index showed an optimal cutoff at 1.7 × 10−3 mm2/s (sensitivity, 0.91; specificity, 0.78; J = 0.69). Conclusions: Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging allowed to accurately differentiate between schwannomas and neurofibromas and to describe their location in relation to the nerve fascicles for preoperative planning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We previously reported that neuropathic pain was associated with smaller posterior cingulate cortical (PCC) volumes, suggesting that a smaller/dysfunctional PCC may contribute to development of pain via impaired mind wandering. A gap in our previous report was lack of evidence for a mechanism for the genesis of PCC atrophy in HIV peripheral neuropathy. Here we investigate if volumetric differences in the subcortex for those with neuropathic paresthesia may contribute to smaller PCC volumes, potentially through deafferentation of ascending white matter tracts resulting from peripheral nerve damage in HIV neuropathy. Since neuropathic pain and paresthesia are highly correlated, statistical decomposition was used to separate pain and paresthesia symptoms to determine which regions of brain atrophy are associated with both pain and paresthesia and which are associated separately with pain or paresthesia. HIV+ individuals (N = 233) with and without paresthesia in a multisite study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry and a segmentation/registration tool were used to investigate regional brain volume changes associated with paresthesia. Analysis of decomposed variables found that smaller midbrain and thalamus volumes were associated with paresthesia rather than pain. However, atrophy in the PCC was related to both pain and paresthesia. Peak thalamic atrophy (p = 0.004; MNI x = − 14, y = − 24, z = − 2) for more severe paresthesia was in a region with reciprocal connections with the PCC. This provides initial evidence that smaller PCC volumes in HIV peripheral neuropathy are related to ascending white matter deafferentation caused by small fiber damage observed in HIV peripheral neuropathy. © 2020, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.

AB  - We sought to assess the utility of simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with the nerve-sheath signal increased by inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of relaxation-enhancement imaging (SHINKEI-Quant) for the quantitative evaluation of compressed nerves in patients with lumbar radiculopathy. Thirty-two patients with lumbar radiculopathy and 5 healthy subjects underwent simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with SHINKEI-Quant. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal nerves distal to the lumbar nerves bilaterally at L4-S1. The T2 relaxation times were measured on the affected and unaffected sides. The T2 ratio was calculated as the affected side/unaffected side. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the correlation between the T2 relaxation times or T2 ratio and clinical symptoms. An ROC curve was used to examine the diagnostic accuracy and threshold of the T2 relaxation times and T2 ratio. We observed no significant differences in the T2 relaxation times between the nerve roots on the left and right at each spinal level in healthy subjects. In patients, lumbar neurography revealed swelling of the involved nerve, and prolonged T2 relaxation times compared with that of the contralateral nerve. The T2 ratio correlated with leg pain. The ROC analysis revealed that the T2 relaxation time threshold was 127 ms and the T2 ratio threshold was 1.07. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the utility of SHINKEI-Quant for the quantitative evaluation of lumbar radiculopathy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: We investigate the importance of high gradient-amplitude and high slew-rate on oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) diffusion imaging for human brain imaging and evaluate human brain imaging with OGSE on the MAGNUS head-gradient insert (200 mT/m amplitude and 500 T/m/s slew rate). Methods: Simulations with cosine-modulated and trapezoidal-cosine OGSE at various gradient amplitudes and slew rates were performed. Six healthy subjects were imaged with the MAGNUS gradient at 3T with OGSE at frequencies up to 100 Hz and b = 450 s/mm2. Comparisons were made against standard pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) diffusion in vivo and in an isotropic diffusion phantom. Results: Simulations show that to achieve high frequency and b-value simultaneously for OGSE, high gradient amplitude, high slew rates, and high peripheral nerve stimulation limits are required. A strong linear trend for increased diffusivity (mean: 8–19%, radial: 9–27%, parallel: 8–15%) was observed in normal white matter with OGSE (20 Hz to 100 Hz) as compared to PGSE. Linear fitting to frequency provided excellent correlation, and using a short-range disorder model provided radial long-term diffusivities of D∞,MD = 911 ± 72 µm2/s, D∞,PD = 1519 ± 164 µm2/s, and D∞,RD = 640 ± 111 µm2/s and correlation lengths of lc ,MD = 0.802 ± 0.156 µm, lc ,PD = 0.837 ± 0.172 µm, and lc ,RD = 0.780 ± 0.174 µm. Diffusivity changes with OGSE frequency were negligible in the phantom, as expected. Conclusion: The high gradient amplitude, high slew rate, and high peripheral nerve stimulation thresholds of the MAGNUS head-gradient enables OGSE acquisition for in vivo human brain imaging. © 2020 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

AB  - The group of Multiplied, Added, Subtracted and/or fiTted Inversion Recovery (MASTIR) pulse sequences in which usually two or more inversion recovery (IR) images of different types are combined is described, and uses for this type of sequence are outlined. IR sequences of different types can be multiplied, added, subtracted, and/or fitted together to produce variants of the MASTIR sequence. The sequences provide a range of options for increasing image contrast, demonstrating specific tissues and fluids of interest, and suppressing unwanted signals. A formalism using the concept of pulse sequences as tissue property filters is used to explain the signal, contrast and weighting of the pulse sequences with both univariate and multivariate filter models. Subtraction of one magnitude reconstructed IR image from another with a shorter TI can produce very high T1 dependent positive contrast from small increases in T1. The reverse subtracted IR sequence can provide high positive contrast enhancement with gadolinium chelates and iron deposition which decrease T1. Additional contrast to that arising from increases in T1 can be produced by supplementing this with contrast arising from concurrent increases in ρm and T2, as well as increases or decreases in diffusion using subtraction IR with echo subtraction and/or diffusion subtraction. Phase images may show 180ºdifferences as a result of rotating into the transverse plane both positive and negative longitudinal magnetization. Phase images with contrast arising in this way, or other ways, can be multiplied by magnitude IR images to increase the contrast of the latter. Magnetization Transfer (MT) and susceptibility can be used with IR sequences to improve contrast. Selective images of white and brown adipose tissue lipid and water components can be produced using different TIs and in and out-of-phase TEs. Selective images of ultrashort and short T2 tissue components can be produced by nulling long T2 tissue components with an inversion pulse and subtraction of images with longer TEs from images with ultrashort TEs. The Double Echo Sliding IR (DESIRE) sequence provides images with a wide range of TIs from which it is possible to choose values of TI to achieve particular types of tissue and/or fluid contrast (e.g., for subtraction with different TIs, as described above, and for long T2 tissue signal nulling with UTE sequences). Unwanted tissue and fluid signals can be suppressed by addition and subtraction of phase-sensitive (ps) and magnitude reconstructed images. The sequence also offers options for synergistic use of the changes in blood and tissue ρm, T1, T2/T2*, D* and perfusion that can be seen with fMRI of the brain. In-vivo and ex-vivo illustrative examples of normal brain, cartilage, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and peripheral nerve imaged with different forms of the MASTIR sequence are included. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

AB  - Introduction: The immuno-microenvironment of injured nerves adversely affects mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy for neurotmesis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used noninvasively to monitor nerve degeneration and regeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate nerve repair after MSC transplantation combined with microenvironment immunomodulation in neurotmesis by using multiparametric MRI. Methods: Rats with sciatic nerve transection and surgical coaptation were treated with MSCs combined with immunomodulation or MSCs alone. Serial multiparametric MRI examinations were performed over an 8-week period after surgery. Results: Nerves treated with MSCs combined with immunomodulation showed better functional recovery, rapid recovery of nerve T2, fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity values, and more rapid restoration of the fiber tracks than nerves treated with MSCs alone. Discussion: Transplantation of MSCs in combination with immunomodulation can exert a synergistic repair effect on neurotmesis, which can be monitored by multiparametric MRI. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) comprises a disparate collection of syndromes affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. Progress in the attribution of neuropsychiatric syndromes to SLE-related mechanisms and development of targeted treatment strategies has been impeded by a lack of objective imaging biomarkers that reflect specific neuropsychiatric syndromes and/or pathologic mechanisms. The present review addresses recent publications of neuroimaging techniques in NPSLE. RECENT FINDINGS: Imaging studies grouping all NPSLE syndromes together are unable to differentiate between NPSLE and non-NPSLE. In contrast, diffusion tensor imaging, FDG-PET, resting, and functional MRI techniques in patients with stable non-NPSLE demonstrate abnormal network structural and functional connectivity and regional brain activity in multiple cortical areas involving the limbic system, hippocampus, frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Some of these changes associate with impaired cognitive performance or mood disturbance, autoantibodies or inflammatory proteins. Longitudinal data suggest progression over time. DCE-MRI demonstrates increased Blood-brain barrier permeability. SUMMARY: Study design issues related to patient selection (non-NPSLE vs. NPSLE syndromes, SLE disease activity, medications) are critical for biomarker development. Regional and network structural and functional changes identified with advanced brain imaging techniques in patients with non-NPSLE may be further developed as biomarkers for cognitive and mood disorders attributable to SLE-related mechanisms.

AB  - Purpose: To develop a highly efficient magnetic field gradient coil for head imaging that achieves 200 mT/m and 500 T/m/s on each axis using a standard 1 MVA gradient driver in clinical whole-body 3.0T MR magnet. Methods: A 42-cm inner diameter head-gradient used the available 89- to 91-cm warm bore space in a whole-body 3.0T magnet by increasing the radial separation between the primary and the shield coil windings to 18.6 cm. This required the removal of the standard whole-body gradient and radiofrequency coils. To achieve a coil efficiency ~4× that of whole-body gradients, a double-layer primary coil design with asymmetric x-y axes, and symmetric z-axis was used. The use of all-hollow conductor with direct fluid cooling of the gradient coil enabled ≥50 kW of total heat dissipation. Results: This design achieved a coil efficiency of 0.32 mT/m/A, allowing 200 mT/m and 500 T/m/s for a 620 A/1500 V driver. The gradient coil yielded substantially reduced echo spacing, and minimum repetition time and echo time. In high b = 10,000 s/mm2 diffusion, echo time (TE) &lt; 50 ms was achieved (&gt;50% reduction compared with whole-body gradients). The gradient coil passed the American College of Radiology tests for gradient linearity and distortion, and met acoustic requirements for nonsignificant risk operation. Conclusions: Ultra-high gradient coil performance was achieved for head imaging without substantial increases in gradient driver power in a whole-body 3.0T magnet after removing the standard gradient coil. As such, any clinical whole-body 3.0T MR system could be upgraded with 3-4× improvement in gradient performance for brain imaging. © 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

AB  - Background: There is histological evidence of microstructural changes in the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve in migraineurs. This raises the possibility that altered trigeminal nerve properties contribute to migraine pathophysiology. Whilst it is not possible to explore the anatomy of small trigeminal nerve branches it is possible to explore the anatomy of the trigeminal root entry zone using magnetic resonance imaging in humans. The aim of this investigation is to assess the microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in vivo to determine if nerve alterations occur in individuals with episodic migraine. Methods: In 39 migraineurs and 39 matched controls, T1-weighted anatomical images were used to calculate the volume (mm3) and maximal cross-sectional area of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone; diffusion tensor images were used to calculate fractional anisotropy, mean diffusion, axial diffusion and radial diffusion. Results: There were significant differences between the left and right nerve of controls and migraineurs with respect to volume and not cross-sectional area. Migraineurs displayed reduced axial diffusion in the right nerve compared to the left nerve, and reduced fractional anisotropy in the left nerve compared to left controls. Furthermore, although there were no differences in mean diffusion or radial diffusion, regional analysis of the nerve revealed significantly greater radial diffusion in the middle and rostral portion of the left trigeminal nerve in migraineurs compared with controls. Conclusions: Migraine pathophysiology is associated with microstructural abnormalities within the trigeminal nerve that are consistent with histological evidence of altered myelin and/or organization. These peripheral nerve changes may provide further insight into migraine pathophysiology and enable a greater understanding for targeted treatments of pain alleviation. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Due to the lack of understanding of the fascicular organisation, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) leads to unwanted off-target effects. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) can be used to trace fascicles from periphery and image fascicular anatomy. New method: In this study, we present a simple and reproducible method for imaging fascicles in peripheral nerves with iodine staining and microCT for the determination of fascicular anatomy and organisation. Results: At the determined optimal pre-processing steps and scanning parameters, the microCT protocol allowed for segmentation and tracking of fascicles within the nerves. This was achieved after 24 hours and 120 hours of staining with Lugol's solution (1% total iodine) for rat sciatic and pig vagus nerves, respectively, and the following scanning parameters: 4 μm voxel size, 35 kVp energy, 114 μA current, 4 W power, 0.25 fps in 4 s exposure time, 3176 projections and a molybdenum target. Comparison with existing method(s): This optimised method for imaging fascicles provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images and full imaging penetration depth not obtainable with methods typically used such as histology, magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence tomography whilst obviating time-consuming pre-processing methods, the amount of memory required, destruction of the samples and the cost associated with current microCT methods. Conclusion: The optimised microCT protocol facilitates segmentation and tracking of the fascicles within the nerve. The resulting segmentation map of the functional anatomical organisation of the vagus nerve will enable selective VNS ultimately allowing for the avoidance of the off-target effects and improving its therapeutic efficacy. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Objective: To quantify peripheral nerve lesions in symptomatic and asymptomatic hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PNP) by analyzing the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of the sciatic nerve, and to test its potential as a novel biomarker for macromolecular changes. Methods: Twenty-five patients with symptomatic ATTRv-PNP, 30 asymptomatic carriers of the mutant transthyretin gene (mutTTR), and 20 age-/sex-matched healthy controls prospectively underwent magnetization transfer contrast imaging at 3 Tesla. Two axial three-dimensional gradient echo sequences with and without an off-resonance saturation rapid frequency pulse were conducted at the right distal thigh. Sciatic nerve regions of interest were manually drawn on 10 consecutive axial slices in the images without off-resonance saturation, and then transferred to the corresponding slices that were generated by the sequence with the off-resonance saturation pulse. Subsequently, the MTR and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the sciatic nerve were evaluated. Detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic examinations were conducted in all ATTRv-PNP patients and mutTTR-carriers. Results: Sciatic nerve MTR and CSA reliably differentiated between ATTRv-PNP, mutTTR-carriers, and controls. MTR was lower in ATTRv-PNP (26.4 ± 0.7; P &lt; 0.0001) and in mutTTR-carriers (32.6 ± 0.8; P = 0.0005) versus controls (39.4 ± 2.1), and was also lower in ATTRv-PNP versus mutTTR-carriers (P = 0.0009). MTR correlated negatively with the NIS-LL and positively with CMAPs and SNAPs. CSA was higher in ATTRv-PNP (34.3 ± 1.7 mm3) versus mutTTR-carriers (26.0 ± 1.1 mm3; P = 0.0005) and versus controls (20.4 ± 1.2 mm3; P &lt; 0.0001). CSA was also higher in mutTTR-carriers versus controls. Interpretation: MTR is a novel imaging marker that can quantify macromolecular changes in ATTRv-PNP and differentiate between symptomatic ATTRv-PNP and asymptomatic mutTTR-carriers and correlates with electrophysiology. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Spinal cord injuries (SCI) normally disrupt the long axonal tracts of the spinal cord and cause permanent neurological deficits, for which there is currently a lack of effective therapeutic methods. Biomaterial-based regenerative medicine is a pivotal strategy to induce axonal regeneration through delivery of biophysical and/or biochemical regulatory cues by biomaterials. We previously fabricated a hierarchically aligned fibrin hydrogel (AFG) that could promote neurogenic differentiation of stem cells in vitro and has been successfully applied for peripheral nerve and spinal cord regeneration in rats. In this study, AFG was used to repair a canine lumbar segment 2 hemisection spinal cord injury, and the consistency of histological, imageological and behavioral results was compared. AFG was used to construct an aligned fiber bridge that supported cell adhesion in vitro and rapidly facilitated tissue invasion along the long axis of fibers in vivo, Moreover, in vivo results demonstrated regrowth of axons in an oriented pattern connecting the rostral and caudal stumps. Consistent results were confirmed by diffusion tensor imaging, which allowed successful tracing of reconnected nerve fibers across the defect. As a result, directional axonal regrowth contributed to significantly improved recovery of motor functional behavior of SCI canines with AFG implantation. Our results suggest that AFG has great promise for rapidly directing axonal regrowth for nerve regeneration.

AB  - Background: Muscle MRI is of increasing importance for neuromuscular patients to detect changes in muscle volume, fat-infiltration, and edema. We developed a method for semi-automated segmentation of muscle MRI datasets. Methods: An active contour-evolution algorithm implemented within the ITK-SNAP software was used to segment T1-weighted MRI, and to quantify muscle volumes of neuromuscular patients (n = 65). Results: Semi-automated compared with manual segmentation was shown to be accurate and time-efficient. Muscle volumes and ratios of thigh/lower leg volume were lower in myopathy patients than in controls (P &lt;.0001; P &lt;.05). We found a decrease of lower leg muscle volume in neuropathy patients compared with controls (P &lt;.01), which correlated with clinical parameters. In myopathy patients, muscle volume showed a positive correlation with muscle strength (rleft = 0.79, pleft &lt;.0001). Muscle volumes were independent of body mass index and age. Conclusions: Our method allows for exact and time-efficient quantification of muscle volumes with possible use as a biomarker in neuromuscular patients. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method for efficient nerve pathways visualization. DTI, particularly of peripheral nerves, is commonly performed in 3 T scanners. An often more accessible 1.5 T scanners are less likely to be chosen for DTI examinations due to generally lower image quality. Novel radiofrequency (RF) coils can help improve the signal to noise ratio in MRI and thus improve image quality. This study preliminary results of the feasibility and outcomes assessment of DTI-based tractography of the forearm nerves employing a novel coil design in 1.5 T scanners. The proposed scanning protocol includes the use of a metamaterial-inspired RF coil, a common DTI pulse sequence and a 3D T1-weighted morphological reference pulse sequence. The protocol is tested on three healthy volunteers. Two tract bundles corresponding to median and ulnar nerves of the forearm are reliably reconstructed in all subjects. The results show that with an appropriate choice of RF coil and pulse sequence parameters forearm DTI studies can be performed in 1.5 T scanners with sufficient quality making such examination more accessible for clinical use. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Cross-sectional MRI has modest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing traumatic brachial plexus root avulsions. Consequently, patients either undergo major exploratory surgery or months of surveillance to determine if and what nerve reconstruction is needed. This study aimed to develop a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol at 3 Tesla to visualize normal roots and identify traumatic root avulsions of the brachial plexus. Seven healthy adults and 12 adults with known (operatively explored) unilateral traumatic brachial plexus root avulsions were scanned. DTI was acquired using a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence at 3 Tesla. The brachial plexus was visualized by deterministic tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated for injured and avulsed roots in the lateral recesses of the vertebral foramen. Compared to healthy nerves roots, the FA of avulsed nerve roots was lower (mean difference 0.1 [95% CI 0.07, 0.13]; p &lt; 0.001) and the MD was greater (mean difference 0.32 × 10−3 mm2/s [95% CI 0.11, 0.53]; p &lt; 0.001). Deterministic tractography reconstructed both normal roots and root avulsions of the brachial plexus; the negative-predictive value for at least one root avulsion was 100% (95% CI 78, 100). Therefore, DTI might help visualize both normal and injured roots of the brachial plexus aided by tractography. The precision of this technique and how it relates to neural microstructure will be further investigated in a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of patients with acute brachial plexus injuries. © Copyright © 2020 Wade, Tanner, Teh, Ridgway, Shelley, Chaka, Rankine, Andersson, Wiberg and Bourke.

AB  - Background: We imaged the corticospinal tract (CST) and corticoreticular pathway (CRP) using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) to evaluate the cause of muscle weakness in a patient who was exposed to high-voltage electricity. Case presentation: A 39-year-old man presented with quadriparesis after high-voltage electrical shock from power lines while working about 5.8 years ago. The electrical current entered through the left hand and exited through the occipital area of the head. The degree of weakness on bilateral upper and lower extremities was 3-4 on the Medical Research Council strength scale. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed 5.8 years after onset. The CST and CRP were depicted by placing two regions of interest for each neural tract on the two-dimensional fractional anisotropy color map. DTT of the DTI scan showed that the bilateral CST and CRP were thinned compared to those of the healthy control subject. On the nerve conduction test, abnormal findings suggesting peripheral nerve lesion were not observed. Therefore, injury of bilateral CST and CRP seems to have contributed to our patient's weakness after the electrical shock. Conclusion: Depiction of neural tracts in the brain using DTT can assist in the accurate and detailed evaluation of the cause of neural deficit after electrical injury. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The peripheral nervous system is increasingly being investigated using medical imaging as a complement or in association with electrodiagnostics tests. The application of imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allows detailed visualization of the peripheral nervous system. According to the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, the use of US for nerve evaluation is strongly encouraged. In addition, the role of US is further enhanced by the wide application of US-guided techniques to diagnose or to treat peripheral nerve disorders. Standard evaluation of peripheral nerves on US usually relies on cross-sectional area evaluation with different cutoff values in the osteofibrous tunnels and outside them. In several anatomical areas, side-to-side comparison is highly recommended because it helps distinguish subtle variations by using the unaffected limb as an internal control. US is widely used to perform US-guided interventional procedures on peripheral nerves. The recent development of radiomics and machine and deep learning applied to peripheral nerves may reveal new insights beyond the capabilities of the human eye. Radiomics may have a role in expanding the diagnostic capabilities of US and MRI in the study of peripheral nerve pathology, especially when the cross-sectional area is not markedly increased. © 2020 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

AB  - Objective: To characterize the spectrum of neurologic involvement in Erdheim–Chester Disease (ECD), a treatable inflammatory neoplasm of histiocytes. Methods: Sixty-two patients with ECD were prospectively enrolled in a natural history study that facilitated collection of clinical, imaging, laboratory, neurophysiologic, and pathologic data. Results: Ninety-four percent of the patients had neurologic abnormalities on examination or imaging, and 22% had neurologic symptoms as the initial presentation of ECD. The most common neurologic findings were cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, pyramidal tract signs, cranial nerve involvement, and cerebellar ataxia. Imaging revealed atrophy and demyelination along with focal lesions that were located throughout the nervous system, dura, and extra-axial structures. The BRAF V600E variant correlated with cerebral atrophy. Brain pathology revealed lipid-laden, phagocytic macrophages (histiocytes) accompanied by demyelination and axonal degeneration. Interpretation: In patients with ECD, neurologic morbidity is common and contributes significantly to disability. Since neurologic symptoms can be the presenting feature of ECD and, given the mean delay in ECD diagnosis is 4.2 years, it is critical that neurologists consider of ECD and other histiocytosis in patients with inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic-appearing white matter. Furthermore, given the broad spectrum of neurologic involvement, neurologists have an important role in a team of specialists treating ECD patients. Published 2020.

AB  - Purpose: Magnetostimulation, also known as peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), is the dominant safety constraint in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the gradient magnetic fields that operate around 0.1–1 kHz, and for the homogeneous drive field in magnetic particle imaging (MPI) that operates around 10–150 kHz. Previous studies did not report correlations between anatomical measures and magnetostimulation thresholds for the gradient magnetic fields in MRI. In contrast, a strong linear correlation was shown between the thresholds and the inverse of body part size in MPI. Yet, the effects of other anatomical measures on the thresholds for the drive field remain unexplored. Here, we investigate the effects of fat percentage on magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range homogeneous magnetic fields such as the drive field in MPI, with the ultimate goal of predicting subject-specific thresholds based on simple anatomical measures. Methods: Human subject experiments were performed on the upper arms of 10 healthy male subjects (age: 26 ± 2 yr) to determine magnetostimulation thresholds. Experiments were repeated three times for each subject, with brief resting periods between repetitions. Using a solenoidal magnetostimulation coil, a homogeneous magnetic field at 25 kHz with 100 ms pulse duration was applied at 4-s intervals, while the subject reported stimulation via a mouse click. To determine the thresholds, individual subject responses were fitted to a cumulative distribution function modeled by a sigmoid curve. Next, anatomical images of the upper arms of the subjects were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner. A two-point Dixon method was used to obtain separate images of water and fat tissues, from which several anatomical measures were derived: the effective outer radius of the upper arm, the effective inner radius (i.e., the muscle radius), and fat percentage. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the threshold and anatomical measures. This statistical analysis was repeated after factoring out the expected effects of body part size. An updated model for threshold prediction is provided, where in addition to scaling in proportion with the inverse of the outer radius, the threshold has an affine dependence on fat percentage. Results: A strong linear correlation (r = 0.783, P < 0.008) was found between magnetostimulation threshold and fat percentage, and the correlation became stronger after factoring out the effects of outer radius (r = 0.839, P < 0.003). While considering body part size alone did not explain any significant variance in measured thresholds (P > 0.398), the updated model that also incorporates fat percentage yielded substantially improved threshold predictions with (Formula presented.) = 0.654 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This work shows for the first time that fat percentage strongly correlates with magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range homogenous magnetic fields such as the drive field in MPI, and that the correlations get even stronger after factoring out the effects of body part size. These results have important practical implications for predicting subject-specific thresholds, which in turn can increase the performance of the drive field and improve image quality while remaining within the safety limits. © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine

AB  - Nerve imaging is an important component in the assessment of patients presenting with suspected peripheral nerve pathology. Although magnetic resonance neurography and ultrasound are the most commonly utilized techniques, several promising new modalities are on the horizon. Nerve imaging is useful in localizing the nerve injury, determining the severity, providing prognostic information, helping establish the diagnosis, and helping guide surgical decision making. The focus of this article is imaging of damaged nerves, focusing on nerve injuries and entrapment neuropathies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Quantitative diffusion MRI is a promising technique for evaluating peripheral nerve integrity but low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede measurement accuracy. Purpose: To evaluate principal component analysis (PCA) and generalized spherical deconvolution (genSD) denoising techniques to improve within-subject reproducibility and peripheral nerve conspicuity. Study Type: Prospective. Subjects: Seven healthy volunteers and three peripheral neuropathy patients. Field Strength/Sequence: 3T/multiband single-shot echo planar diffusion sequence using multishell 55-direction scheme. Assessment: Images were processed using four methods: "original" (no denoising), "average" (10 repetitions), "PCA-only," and "PCA + genSD." Tibial and common peroneal nerve segmentations and masks were generated from volunteer diffusion data. Quantitative (SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) values were calculated. Three radiologists qualitatively evaluated nerve conspicuity for each method. The two denoising methods were also performed in three patients with peripheral neuropathies. Statistical Tests: For healthy volunteers, calculations included SNR and CNRFA (computed using FA values). Coefficient of variation (CV%) of CNRFA quantified within-subject reproducibility. Groups were compared with two-sample t-tests (significance P &lt; 0.05; two-tailed, Bonferroni-corrected). Odds ratios (ORs) quantified the relative rates of each of three radiologists confidently identifying a nerve, per slice, for the four methods. Results: "PCA + genSD" yielded the highest SNR (meanoverall = 14.83 ± 1.99) and tibial and common peroneal nerve CNRFA (meantibial = 3.45, meanperoneal = 2.34) compared to "original" (PSNR &lt; 0.001; PCNR = 0.011) and "PCA-only" (PSNR &lt; 0.001, PCNR &lt; 0.001). "PCA + genSD" had higher within-subject reproducibility (low CV%) for tibial (6.04 ± 1.98) and common peroneal nerves (8.27 ± 2.75) compared to "original" and "PCA-only." The mean FA was higher for "original" than "average" (P &lt; 0.001), but did not differ significantly between "average" and "PCA + genSD" (P = 0.14). "PCA + genSD" had higher tibial and common peroneal nerve conspicuity than "PCA-only" (ORtibial = 2.50, P &lt; 0.001; ORperoneal = 1.86, P &lt; 0.001) and "original" (ORtibial = 2.73, P &lt; 0.001; ORperoneal = 2.43, P &lt; 0.001). Data Conclusion: PCA + genSD denoising method improved SNR, CNRFA, and within-subject reproducibility (CV%) without biasing FA and nerve conspicuity. This technique holds promise for facilitating more reliable, unbiased diffusion measurements of peripheral nerves. Level of Evidence: 2. Technical Efficacy Stage: 1. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - There is no imaging modality to quantitatively evaluate compressed cervical nerve roots in cervical radiculopathy. Here we sought to evaluate the usefulness of simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with nerve-sheath signal increased with inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of relaxation-enhancement imaging (SHINKEI-Quant) to evaluate compressed nerves quantitatively in patients with cervical radiculopathy due to cervical disc hernia before microendoscopic surgery. One patient with cervical radiculopathy due to cervical disc hernia before microendoscopic surgery and 5 healthy subjects underwent simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with SHINKEI-Quant. The patient was a 49-year-old man with severe right upper arm pain and numbness. Based on MRI images, we suspected right C7 radiculopathy due to C6-7 cervical disc hernia. The T2 relaxation times of the cervical dorsal root ganglia of the brachial plexus bilaterally at C5–C8 were measured. We observed no significant differences in T2 relaxation times between the nerve roots on the left and right at each spinal level with values in healthy subjects. In our patient, neurography revealed swelling of the right C7 nerve, and a prolonged T2 relaxation time compared with that of the contralateral, unaffected C7 nerve. We performed microendoscopic surgery and the symptoms improved. We were able to evaluate the injured nerve root quantitatively in a patient with cervical radiculopathy using the SHINKEI-Quant technique, being the first study to our knowledge to show the usefulness of this technique to evaluate cervical radiculopathy quantitatively before microendoscopic surgery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gluten-related neurological disorders (GRND) represent a spectrum of neurological manifestations that are triggered by gluten. In coeliac disease, a T-cell mediated enteropathy is triggered by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The underlying pathological mechanism of the neurological dysfunction is not yet clear. The aim of this review is to collate existing neuropathological findings in GRND as a means of aiding the understanding of the pathophysiology. A systematic search of the Pubmed Database yielded 188 articles, of which 32 were included, containing 98 eligible cases with a description of pathological findings in GRND. In gluten ataxia, loss of Purkinje cells, atrophy, gliosis and astrocytosis were apparent, as well as diffuse lymphocytic infiltration and perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes. In patients with large-fiber neuropathy, nerve biopsies revealed axonopathy, loss of myelinated fibers and focal and perivascular infiltration by inflammatory cells. Inflammatory infiltrate was also observed in muscle in myopathy and in cerebrum of patients with encephalopathy and patients with epilepsy. Such changes were not seen in skin biopsies from patients with small fiber neuropathies. The findings from this systematic review suggest an immune mediated pathogenesis for GRND. Future research should focus on the characterization of the inflammatory cell infiltrates and identifying target epitopes. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Purpose: MR neurography(MRN) is an advanced imaging technique to visualize peripheral nerves. Our aim was to determine the value of morphological features of lumbosacral nerve roots on MRN in diagnosing chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy(CIDP) and analyze their correlations with electrophysiological parameters. Methods: MRN of lumbosacral plexus was performed in 21 CIDP patients and 21 healthy volunteers. The cross-sectional areas(CSAs) and signal intensities(SI) of L3 to S1 nerve roots were measured and compared between two groups. Receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curves were plotted to assess the diagnostic accuracy. All patients also underwent nerve conduction studies. Correlations between CSAs and SI of lumbosacral nerve roots and electrophysiological parameters were analyzed. Results: Compared with control group, CIDP patients showed significantly increased CSAs and SI from L3 to S1 nerve root (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.05 respectively for all nerve roots). The CSAmean and SImean were 28.04 ± 8.55mm2, 1.314 ± 0.199 for patient group and 14.91 ± 2.36mm2,1.155 ± 0.094 for control group. ROC analysis revealed the best diagnostic accuracy for the CSAmean with an area under the curve of 0.968 and optimal cut-off value of 19.20 mm2. CSAs of L5 or S1 nerve root correlated positively with central latency and negatively with conduction velocity of tibial nerve. SI of L5 also had a positive correlation with latency of sural nerve. Conclusions: Evaluation of lumbosacral nerve roots on MRN in a quantitative manner may serve as an important tool to support the diagnosis of CIDP. © 2020

AB  - Imaging studies of peripheral nerves have increased considerably in the last ten years. In addition to the classical and still valid study by ultrasound, new neurographic techniques developed from conventional morphological sequences (including 3 D isotropic studies with fat suppression) are making it possible to assess different peripheral nerves and plexuses, including small sensory and/or motor branches, with great precision. Diffusion-weighted sequences and diffusion tensor imaging have opened a new horizon in neurographic studies. This new approach provides morphological and functional information about the internal structure and pathophysiology of the peripheral nerves and diseases that involve them. This update reviews the different MR neurography techniques available for the study of the peripheral nerves, with special emphasis on new sequences based on diffusion. © 2019 SERAM

AB  - Background: Preoperative prediction of the grade of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) is important because of its effect on treatment planning. Purpose: To assess the value of radiomics features in distinguishing histological grades of STSs. Study Type: Retrospective. Population: In all, 113 patients with pathology-confirmed low-grade (grade I), intermediate-grade (grade II), or high-grade (grade III) soft tissue sarcoma were collected. Field Strength/Sequence: The 3.0T axial T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) with 550 msec repetition time (TR); 18 msec echo time (TE), 312 × 312 matrix, fat-suppressed fast spin-echo T2WI with 4291 msec TR, 85 msec TE, 312 × 312 matrix. Assessment: Multiple machine-learning methods were trained to establish classification models for predicting STS grades. Eighty STS patients (18 low-grade [grade I]; 62 high-grade [grades II–III]) were enrolled in the primary set and we tested the model with a validation set with 33 patients (7 low-grade, 26 high-grade). Statistical Tests: 1) Student's t-tests were applied for continuous variables and the χ2 test were applied for categorical variables between low-grade STS and high-grade STS groups. 2) For feature subset selection, either no subset selection or recursive feature elimination was performed. This technology was combined with random forest and support vector machine-learning methods. Finally, to overcome the disparity in the frequencies of the STS grades, each machine-learning model was trained i) without subsampling, ii) with the synthetic minority oversampling technique, and iii) with random oversampling examples, for a total of 12 combinations of machine-learning algorithms that were assessed, trained, and tested in the validation cohort. Results: The best classification model for the prediction of STS grade was a combination of features selected by recursive feature elimination and random forest classification algorithms with a synthetic minority oversampling technique, which had an area under the curve of 0.9615 (95% confidence interval 0.8944–1.0) in the validation set. Data Conclusion: Radiomics feature-based machine-learning methods are useful for distinguishing STS grades. Level of Evidence: 3. Technical Efficacy: Stage 2. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Although diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) has long been considered a disease of the peripheral nervous system, recent neuroimaging studies have shown that alterations in the central nervous system may play a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Here, we used surface-based morphometry (SBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to investigate gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) differences between patients with DPN (n = 67, 44 painless and 23 painful) and healthy controls (HCs; n = 88). Compared with HCs, patients with DPN exhibited GM abnormalities in the pre- and postcentral gyrus and in several deep GM nuclei (caudate, putamen, medial pallidum, thalamus, and ventral nuclear). They also exhibited altered WM tracts (corticospinal tract, spinothalamic tract, and thalamocortical projecting fibers). These findings suggest impaired motor and somatosensory pathways in DPN. Further, patients with DPN (particularly painful DPN) exhibited morphological differences in the cingulate, insula, prefrontal cortex, and thalamus, as well as impaired WM integrity in periaqueductal WM and internal and external capsules. This suggests pain-perception/modulation pathways are altered in painful DPN. Intermodal correlation analyses found that the morphological indices of the brain regions identified by the SBM analysis were significantly correlated with the fractional anisotropy of brain regions identified by the TBSS analysis, suggesting that the GM and WM alterations were tightly coupled. Overall, our study showed sensorimotor and pain-related GM and WM alterations in patients with DPN, which might be involved in the development of DPN. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To assess the discriminative power of radiomics of peripheral nerves at 1.5T MRI, using common entrapment neuropathies of the upper limb as a model system of focal nerve injury. Materials and methods: Radiomics was retrospectively done on peripheral nerve fascicles on T1-weighted 1.5T MRI of 40 patients with diagnosis of mild carpal (n = 25) and cubital tunnel (n = 15) syndrome and of 200 controls. Z-score normalization and Mann–Whitney U test were used to compare features of normal and pathological peripheral nerves. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. Results: A total of n = 104 radiomics features were computed for each patient and control. Significant differences between normal and pathological median and ulnar nerves were found in n = 23/104 features (p < 0.001). According to features classification, n = 5/23 features were shape-based, n = 7/23 were first-order features, n = 11/23 features were classified as gray level run length matrix. Nine of the selected features showed an AUC higher that 0.7: minimum AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.61–0.89) for sum variance and maximum AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.82–0.99) for zone entropy. Conclusion: Features analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences between normal and pathological nerve. The results suggested that radiomics analysis could assess the median and ulnar nerve inner structure changes due to the loss of the fascicular pattern, intraneural edema, fibrosis or fascicular alterations in mild carpal tunnel and mild cubital tunnel syndromes even when the nerve cross-sectional area does not change. © 2019, Italian Society of Medical Radiology.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate if diffusion-tensor-imaging MR-Neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect lesions of peripheral nerves due to polyneuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Ten patients with type 2 diabetes with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 patients with type 2 diabetes without polyneuropathy (nDPN) as well as 20 healthy controls (HC) were included. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions (tibial nerve) of the lower extremity. Fractional-anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity (mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD)) were calculated and compared to neuropathy severity. Conventional T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density data were obtained from a multi-echo SE sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity of DTI-MRN from receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Results: The proximal and distal FA was lowest in patients with DPN compared with nDPN and HC (p < 0.01). Likewise, proximal and distal RD was highest in patients with DPN (p < 0.01). MD and AD were also significantly different though less pronounced. ROC curve analyses of DTI separated nDPN and DPN with area-under-the-curve values ranging from 0.65 to 0.98. T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density could not differentiate between nDPN and DPN. Conclusion: DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher RD. These alterations are likely to reflect both proximal and distal nerve fiber pathology in patients with type 2 diabetes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: Brain atrophy is an established biomarker for dementia, yet spinal cord involvement has not been investigated to date. As the spinal cord is relaying sensorimotor control signals from the cortex to the peripheral nervous system and vice-versa, it is indeed a very interesting question to assess whether it is affected by atrophy due to a disease that is known for its involvement of cognitive domains first and foremost, with motor symptoms being clinically assessed too. We, therefore, hypothesize that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), severe atrophy can affect the spinal cord too and that spinal cord atrophy is indeed an important in vivo imaging biomarker contributing to understanding neurodegeneration associated with dementia. Methods: 3DT1 images of 31 AD and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were processed to calculate volume of brain structures and cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume (CSV) of the cervical cord [per vertebra as well as the C2-C3 pair (CSA23 and CSV23)]. Correlated features (ρ > 0.7) were removed, and the best subset identified for patients’ classification with the Random Forest algorithm. General linear model regression was used to find significant differences between groups (p ≤ 0.05). Linear regression was implemented to assess the explained variance of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score as a dependent variable with the best features as predictors. Results: Spinal cord features were significantly reduced in AD, independently of brain volumes. Patients classification reached 76% accuracy when including CSA23 together with volumes of hippocampi, left amygdala, white and gray matter, with 74% sensitivity and 78% specificity. CSA23 alone explained 13% of MMSE variance. Discussion: Our findings reveal that C2-C3 spinal cord atrophy contributes to discriminate AD from HC, together with more established features. The results show that CSA23, calculated from the same 3DT1 scan as all other brain volumes (including right and left hippocampi), has a considerable weight in classification tasks warranting further investigations. Together with recent studies revealing that AD atrophy is spread beyond the temporal lobes, our result adds the spinal cord to a number of unsuspected regions involved in the disease. Interestingly, spinal cord atrophy explains also cognitive scores, which could significantly impact how we model sensorimotor control in degenerative diseases with a primary cognitive domain involvement. Prospective studies should be purposely designed to understand the mechanisms of atrophy and the role of the spinal cord in AD. © Copyright © 2020 Lorenzi, Palesi, Castellazzi, Vitali, Anzalone, Bernini, Cotta Ramusino, Sinforiani, Micieli, Costa, D’Angelo and Gandini Wheeler-Kingshott.

AB  - Background: The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is well innervated by braches of the trigeminal nerve. The temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) can cause neural-inflammation in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) at the site of injury, or compression, and may have systemic effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Neural-inflammation causes elevations in cytokine expression and microglia activation. When the site of injury, or compression is treated, or relieved, neural inflammation is reduced. These changes can be seen and measured with fMRI brain activities. Methods: For this study, patients with comorbid TMD and systemic/neurologic conditions were compared using clinical diagnostic markers, inflammatory, pain, tissue destruction enzymatic biomarkers, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity of the brain, with and without a custom-made dental orthotic. Results: Our results showed a correlation between the clinical diagnosis of the pathological TMJ, biomarkers and the fMRI study. There was a marked elevation of biomarkers in samples taken from TMJ of patients who were clinically diagnosed with TMD. The fMRI study of TMD patients showed an abnormal hyper-connected salience network and a diminished blood flow to the anterior frontal lobes when they did not wear their customized dental orthotics. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of TMJ-CNS connections and use of fMRI as an investigative tool for understanding TMD and its related neurological pathologies. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that a magnetic resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can differentiate between crush and complete transection peripheral nerve injuries in a rat model ex vivo. DTI measures the directionally dependent effect of tissue barriers on the random diffusion of water molecules. In ordered tissues such as nerves, this information can be used to reconstruct the primary direction of diffusion along fiber tracts, which may provide information on fiber tract continuity after nerve injury and surgical repair. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with different degrees of partial transection of the sciatic nerve followed by immediate repair and euthanized after 1 week of recovery. Nerves were then harvested, fixed, and scanned with a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging to obtain DTIand fiber tractography in each sample. Additional behavioral (sciatic function index, foot fault asymmetry) and histological (Toluidine blue staining) assessments were performed for validation. Results: Tractography yielded a visual representation of the degree of injury that correlated with behavioral and histological evaluations. Conclusions: DTI tractography is a noninvasive tool that can yield a visual representation of a partial nerve transection as early as 1 week after surgical repair. © 2020 The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

AB  - Introduction: Leukodystrophies constitute heterogenous group of rare heritable disorders primarily affecting the white matter of central nervous system. These conditions are often under-appreciated among physicians. The first clinical manifestations of leukodystrophies are often nonspecific and can occur in different ages from neonatal to late adulthood periods. The diagnosis is, therefore, challenging in most cases. Area covered: Herein, the authors discuss different aspects of leukodystrophies. The authors used MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GOOGLE SCHOLAR to provide an extensive update about epidemiology, classifications, pathology, clinical findings, diagnostic tools, and treatments of leukodystrophies. Comprehensive evaluation of clinical findings, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and genetic studies play the key roles in the early diagnosis of individuals with leukodystrophies. No cure is available for most heritable white matter disorders but symptomatic treatments can significantly decrease the burden of events. New genetic methods and stem cell transplantation are also under investigation to further increase the quality and duration of life in affected population. Expert opinion: The improvements in molecular diagnostic tools allow us to identify the meticulous underlying etiology of leukodystrophies and result in higher diagnostic rates, new classifications of leukodystrophies based on genetic information, and replacement of symptomatic managements with more specific targeted therapies.

AB  - This chapter offers a comprehensive summary of applications of advanced diffusion encoding methods in MRI within a narrowly defined area of in vivo human measurements with imaging read-out and voxel-by-voxel data analysis. The list of methods comprises tensor-valued encoding to investigate cell densities, shapes, and orientations in heterogeneous tissues, time/frequency-dependent encoding for estimating structural length scales, adjustable velocity-encoding to monitor flow in the microcapillary network, double encoding with varying mixing times to assess diffusional exchange between distinct tissue microenvironments and across cell membranes, and relaxation-diffusion correlation to resolve and separately characterize tissue microenvironments in terms of their local chemical composition and microstructure. The shown examples include proof-of-concept measurements on healthy volunteers, pilot investigations of pathologies, and clinical research involving 10-100 subjects. Studied organs include brain, breast, prostate, liver, kidney, placenta, muscle, and peripheral nerve, with examples of pathologies from tumors, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, stroke, neurocysticercosis, pre-eclampsia, and chronic exertional compartment syndrome. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia with around 50 million people suffering from this disease worldwide. Mutations in the ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 7 (ABCA7) have been reported to cause susceptibility to AD 9 (OMIM #608907). In this study, we report a novel variant in ABCA7 in a Saudi patient with susceptibility to AD 9 and a strong family history of neurodegenerative disorders, which may be explained by the same variant. We studied a single 57-year-old female patient with typical symptoms of AD supported by MRI findings from a Saudi family with a positive history of a similar disease in multiple individuals. The case study was conducted in King Abdulaziz Medical City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Whole-exome sequencing identified the novel heterozygous variant c.3706C>T p.(Avg 1236Cys) in the ABCA7 gene, which leads to an amino acid exchange. Furthermore, bioinformatics in silico programs predict a pathogenic effect for this variant. To the best of our knowledge, the variant has not been described in the literature so far as evidenced by a thorough literature review using multiple databases such as Ovid, Medline, EMBASE, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and PubMed. In this article, we reported a middle-aged Saudi woman with a novel variant in ABCA7 who had clinical features of both AD and Parkinson's disease. Given the reported function of this gene, it is most likely that it is etiological and pathological because of the presenting complex neurological disease due to decreased clearance of β-amyloid and α-Synuclein. We illustrate the importance of this interesting gene that could be implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders. © 2020 International Advancement Center for Medicine and Health Research.

AB  - Background: Small peripheral nerve tractography is challenging because of the trade-off among resolution, image acquisition time, and signal-to-noise ratio. Purpose: To optimize pixel size and slice thickness parameters for fiber tractography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material and Methods: Fifteen healthy volunteers (mean age 30 ± 6.8 years) were recruited prospectively. Axial T2-weighted and DTI scans were acquired, covering the cubital tunnel, using different pixel sizes and slice thicknesses. Three-dimensional (3D) nerve tractography was evaluated for the median number and length of the reconstructed fiber tracts and visual score from 0 to 5. Two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional DTI was evaluated for fractional anisotropy (FA) values throughout the length of the ulnar nerve. Results: A pixel size of 1.3 mm2 revealed the highest number of reconstructed nerve fibers compared to that of 1.1 mm2 (P = 0.048), with a good visual score. A slice thickness of 4 mm had the highest number of reconstructed nerve fibers and visual score compared with other thicknesses (all P &lt; 0.05). In 2D cross-sectional images, the median FA values were in the range of 0.40–0.63 at the proximal, central, and distal portions of the cubital tunnel. Inter-observer agreement for all parameters was good to excellent. Conclusion: For fiber tractography and DTI of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel, optimal image quality was obtained using a 1.3-mm2 pixel size and 4-mm slice thickness under MR parameters of this study at 3T. © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2020.

AB  - Optogenetics has become an integral tool for studying and dissecting the neural circuitries of the brain using optical control. Recently, it has also begun to be used in the investigation of the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. However, information on these regions' optical properties is sparse. Moreover, there is a lack of data on the dependence of light propagation with respect to neural tissue organization and orientation. This information is important for effective simulations and optogenetic planning, particularly in the spinal cord where the myelinated axons are highly organized. To this end, we report experimental measurements for the scattering coefficient, validated with three different methods in both the longitudinal and radial directions of multiple mammalian spinal cords. In our analysis, we find that there is indeed a directional dependence of photon propagation when interacting with organized myelinated axons. Specifically, light propagating perpendicular to myelinated axons in the white matter of the spinal cord produced a measured reduced scattering coefficient (μs′) of 3.52 ± 0.1 mm-1, and light that was propagated along the myelinated axons in the white matter produced a measured μs′ of 1.57 ± 0.03 mm-1, across the various species considered. This 50% decrease in scattering power along the myelinated axons is observed with three different measurement strategies (integrating spheres, observed transmittance, and punch-through method). Furthermore, this directional dependence in scattering power and overall light attenuation did not occur in the gray matter regions where the myelin organization is nearly random. The acquired information will be integral in preparing future light-transport simulations and in overall optogenetic planning in both the spinal cord and the brain. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Nerve regeneration after an injury should occur in a timely fashion for function to be restored. Current methods cannot monitor regeneration prior to muscle reinnervation. Diffusion tensor imaging has been previously shown to provide quantitative indices after nerve recovery. The goal of this study was to validate the use of this technology following nerve injury via a series of rat sciatic nerve injury/repair studies. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were prospectively divided by procedure (sham, crush, or cut/repair) and time points (1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after surgery). At the appropriate time point, each animal was euthanized and the sciatic nerve was harvested and fixed. Data were obtained using a 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system. For validation, findings were compared to behavioral testing (foot fault asymmetry and sciatic function index) and cross-sectional axonal counting of toluidine blue-stained sections examined under light microscopy. Results: Sixty-three rats were divided into three treatment groups (sham, n = 21; crush, n = 23; and cut/repair, n = 19). Fractional anisotropy was able to differentiate between recovery following sham, crush, and cut/repair injuries as early as 2 weeks (p < 0.05), with more accurate differentiation thereafter. More importantly, the difference in anisotropy between distal and proximal regions recognized animals with successful and failed recoveries according to behavioral analysis, especially at 12 weeks. In addition, diffusion tension imaging-based tractography provided a visual representation of nerve continuity in all treatment groups. Conclusions: Diffuse tensor imaging is an objective and noninvasive tool for monitoring nerve regeneration. Its use could facilitate earlier detection of failed repairs to potentially help improve outcomes. Copyright © 2020 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

AB  - Background: The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying painful symptoms in diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) are poorly understood. They may be associated with MRI characteristics, which have not yet been investigated. Purpose: To investigate correlations between nerve structure, load and spatial distribution of nerve lesions, and pain in patients with DPN. Materials and Methods: In this prospective single-center cross-sectional study, participants with type 1 or 2 diabetes volunteered between June 2015 and March 2018. Participants underwent 3-T MR neurography of the sciatic nerve with a T2-weighed fatsuppressed sequence, which was preceded by clinical and electrophysiologic tests. For group comparisons, analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed depending on Gaussian or non-Gaussian distribution of data. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for correlation analysis. Results: A total of 131 participants (mean age, 62 years ± 11 [standard deviation]; 82 men) with either type 1 (n = 45) or type 2 (n = 86) diabetes were evaluated with painful (n = 64), painless (n = 37), or no (n = 30) DPN. Participants who had painful diabetic neuropathy had a higher percentage of nerve lesions in the full nerve volume (15.2% ± 1.6) than did participants with nonpainful DPN (10.4% ± 1.7, P = .03) or no DPN (8.3% ± 1.7; P < .001). The amount and extension of T2-weighted hyperintense nerve lesions correlated positively with the neuropathy disability score (r = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21, 0.52; r = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.52, respectively) and the neuropathy symptom score (r = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.55; r = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.49, respectively). Negative correlations were found for the tibial nerve conduction velocity (r = 20.23; 95% CI: 20.44, 20.01; r = 20.37; 95% CI: 20.55, 20.15, respectively). The cross-sectional area of the nerve was positively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.36). Negative correlations were found for the tibial nerve conduction velocity (r = 20.24; 95% CI: 20.45, 20.01). Conclusion: The amount and extension of T2-weighted hyperintense fascicular nerve lesions were greater in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy than in those with painless diabetic neuropathy. These results suggest that proximal fascicular damage is associated with the evolution of painful sensory symptoms in diabetic polyneuropathy. © RSNA, 2019.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is now seen as a systemic disease involving also the central nervous system [1], but the link between the kidney and different organ systems and disease went unnoticed for a long time. The king of Poland, Stephen Bathory (1533-86), suffered from CKD due to polycystic kidney disease and depression [2]. Similarly, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was also thought to have had CKD [3] and depression [4]. A list of 'Famous People Who Have Died from Kidney Disease' [5] includes many who suffered from both CKD and depression or other signs of mental illness. Is this a coincidence or actually evidence of a link between kidney disease and brain dysfunction? This is not merely an academic question because all forms of mental illness can seriously impair an individual's quality of life, and are frequently associated with progression of diseases and premature mortality, so it is worth the effort of trying to answer it. Europe and much of the industrialized countries are experiencing growing numbers of patients with CKD within their ageing populations [6]. CKD is complex and potentially fatal: (i) all organs are affected, sooner or later; (ii) the balance of plasma volume, electrolytes, acid-base and minerals, metabolites, hormones and proteins is disturbed; and (iii) patients often need a multidisciplinary team approach managing complex comorbidities, drug regimens and special diets. Although the prognosis of patients with CKD remains poor, their increasing life expectancy has shifted medical attention from life-threatening emergencies to long-term complications and sequelae, and how to improve quality of life [7]. Indeed, kidney failure has detrimental effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), reaching levels similar to those seen in patients with metastatic cancer [8]. This might be due to psychological factors, both kidney disease and cancer being chronic diseases with a bad prognosis. However, although the effect of CKD on quality of life is more evident in advanced stages (stage G4P) and in older patients [9, 10], a large study has shown a significant decrease in HRQoL as early as CKD stage G2 [11]. Notably, neurological and cognitive impairments [12], and depression [13] are among the most debilitating consequences of CKD contributing to the significantly reduced HRQoL [14]. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Purpose: To establish peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) thresholds for an ultra-high performance magnetic field gradient subsystem (simultaneous 200-mT/m gradient amplitude and 500-T/m/s gradient slew rate; 1 MVA per axis [MAGNUS]) designed for neuroimaging with asymmetric transverse gradients and 42-cm inner diameter, and to determine PNS threshold dependencies on gender, age, patient positioning within the gradient subsystem, and anatomical landmarks. Methods: The MAGNUS head gradient was installed in a whole-body 3T scanner with a custom 16-rung bird-cage transmit/receive RF coil compatible with phased-array receiver brain coils. Twenty adult subjects (10 male, mean ± SD age = 40.4 ± 11.1 years) underwent the imaging and PNS study. The tests were repeated by displacing subject positions by 2-4 cm in the superior–inferior and anterior–posterior directions. Results: The x-axis (left–right) yielded mostly facial stimulation, with mean ΔGmin = 111 ± 6 mT/m, chronaxie = 766 ± 76 µsec. The z-axis (superior–inferior) yielded mostly chest/shoulder stimulation (123 ± 7 mT/m, 620 ± 62 µsec). Y-axis (anterior–posterior) stimulation was negligible. X-axis and z-axis thresholds tended to increase with age, and there was negligible dependency with gender. Translation in the inferior and posterior directions tended to increase the x-axis and z-axis thresholds, respectively. Electric field simulations showed good agreement with the PNS results. Imaging at MAGNUS gradient performance with increased PNS threshold provided a 35% reduction in noise-to-diffusion contrast as compared with whole-body performance (80 mT/m gradient amplitude, 200 T/m/sec gradient slew rate). Conclusion: The PNS threshold of MAGNUS is significantly higher than that for whole-body gradients, which allows for diffusion gradients with short rise times (under 1 msec), important for interrogating brain microstructure length scales. © 2019 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

AB  - Nerve regeneration after injury must occur in a timely fashion to restore function. Unfortunately, current methods (e.g., electrophysiology) provide limited information following trauma, resulting in delayed management and suboptimal outcomes. Herein, we evaluated the ability of diffusion MRI to monitor nerve regeneration after injury/repair. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three treatment groups (sham = 21, crush = 23, cut/repair = 19) and ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was performed 1–12 weeks post-surgery. Behavioral data showed a distinction between crush and cut/repair nerves at 4 weeks. This was consistent with DTI, which found that thresholds based on the ratio of radial and axial diffusivities (RD/AD = 0.40 ± 0.02) and fractional anisotropy (FA = 0.53 ± 0.01) differentiated crush from cut/repair injuries. By the 12th week, cut/repair nerves whose behavioral data indicated a partial recovery were below the RD/AD threshold (and above the FA threshold), while nerves that did not recover were on the opposite side of each threshold. Additional morphometric analysis indicated that DTI-derived normalized scalar indices report on axon density (RD/AD: r = −0.54, p &lt; 1e-3; FA: r = 0.56, p &lt; 1e-3). Interestingly, higher-order DKI analyses did not improve our ability classify recovery. These findings suggest that DTI may provide promising biomarkers for distinguishing successful/unsuccessful nerve repairs and potentially identify cases that require reoperation. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - We report on a patient with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) who was diagnosed with conversion disorder for severe weakness of an arm, which was demonstrated using diffiusion tensor tractography (DTT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A 23-year-old right-handed female suffered from head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident. She underwent rehabilitative management for memory impairment and central pain. At 14 months after onset, she complained of severe weakness of her right arm, which was detected in the morning after sleeping (right shoulder abductor: 3/5, elbow flexor: 3/5, wrist extensor: 1/5, finger flexor: 1/5, and finger extensor: 1/5). Electromyography study for peripheral neuropathy performed at 2 weeks after onset of weakness showed no abnormality. On a 14-month DTT configuration, the integrities of the left corticospinal tract (CST), supplementary motor area-corticofugal tract (SMA-CFT), and dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC)-CFT were well-preserved. Significant differences were not observed for the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffiusivity (MD), and tract volume (TV) values of the CST, SMA-CFT, and dPMC-CFT in both hemispheres between the patient and ten right-handed age- and sex-matched normal subjects (p > 0.05). On a 14-month TMS study, MEPs obtained at the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle showed no abnormality. Using DTT and TMS, conversion disorder was demonstrated in a patient with mild TBI, who showed severe weakness of an arm. Our results suggest the usefulness of an evaluation of the CST and CFTs from the secondary motor areas using DTT, and the CST using TMS for patients who complain of motor weakness due to conversion disorder. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Centralized pain syndromes (CPS), including chronic pelvic pain (CPP) syndrome, are significant public health problems with prevalence more than diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. A variety of pathologies are linked with CPP syndrome; however, pain often continues without the presence of pathology, or when an underlying pelvic disease is found, the extent and severity of pain are disproportionate. Although this is not a systematic review, we performed a detailed literature search to identify relevant papers and to provide the available evidence for central changes in association with CPP syndrome. Recent Findings: Recent advances in brain imaging techniques have provided more accurate data on gray matter volume, functional connectivity, and metabolite levels in the pain-relevant areas of the brain. The present evidence shows that like other chronic pain conditions, the CPP syndrome is associated with central nervous system (CNS) alterations. In particular, these include changes in brain structure, in the activity of both the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system, and in the behavioral and central response to noxious stimulation. Summary: A growing body of evidence, mostly from neuroimaging, suggests that for many patients with CPP, the pain may be associated to changes in both structure and function of the CNS. The treatment of pain symptoms, even without the presence of identifiable pathology, may prevent the development or at least minimize the progression of long-term central changes. These findings support the use of new therapeutic strategies targeting the CNS for controlling of pain in CPP conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Peripheral neuropathies are a group of disorders which affect the peripheral nervous system which have been conventionally diagnosed using electrodiagnostic studies. This study was carried out to assess the role of imaging in diagnosing peripheral mononeuropathy as exact anatomical localisation of the pathology is possible using high-resolution ultrasound and MR neurography, the modalities assessed in this study. Method: A hospital-based prospective analytical study was carried out in a resource-limited setting on 180 peripheral nerves in 131 patients with symptoms of peripheral mononeuropathy after taking IRB approval. Each patient underwent high-resolution ultrasound examination and MR neurography, findings of which were then compared and statistically analysed assuming electrodiagnostic findings as the gold standard. Results: Overall, the diagnostic accuracy was highest for the proton density fat-saturated MR sequence (93.89%) followed by high-resolution ultrasound (80%). The sensitivity was highest for proton density fat-saturated sequence while the T1 MR sequence had the highest specificity. Combined diagnostic accuracy of both modalities was calculated to be 93.33% with a negative predictive value of 80%. High-resolution ultrasound and MRI equally detected the cases with nerve discontinuity, while neuromas were better identified on MRI. Conclusion: With the advent of higher frequency probes and improved MR field strength, imaging of peripheral nerves is possible with better accuracy. Imaging assessment of nerves allows anatomical delineation with identification of exact site of involvement. This comparative study demonstrates the role of imaging in diagnosing peripheral nerve pathologies with the accuracy of MRI as high as 93.89% which may serve as an imaging gold standard. High-resolution ultrasound, being quicker, cost effective and a comparable accuracy of 80% can serve as a reliable screening tool. This study incorporates a larger study group and compares HRUS with MRI, taking NCV as gold standard, which has not been done in the preceding studies. With this study, we conclude that these two imaging modalities are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they complement each other and can be used in conjunction as an imaging yardstick for diagnosing peripheral neuropathies. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Advanced imaging is increasingly used by upper extremity surgeons in the diagnosis and evaluation of peripheral nerve pathology. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) have emerged as the most far-reaching modalities for peripheral nerve imaging and often provide complimentary information. Technology improvements allow better depiction of the peripheral nervous system, allowing for more accurate diagnoses and preoperative planning. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of current modalities and expected advances in peripheral nerve imaging with a focus on practical applications in the clinical setting. Ultrasound is safe, inexpensive, and readily available, and allows dynamic imaging with high spatial resolution as well as immediate evaluation of the contralateral nerve for comparison. It is primarily limited by its dependency on skilled operators and soft tissue contrast. The spatial evaluation of the perineural environment, fascicular echostructure, and nerve diameter are features of particular use in the diagnosis and treatment of nerve tumors, compressive lesions, and nerve trauma. Sonoelastrography has shown promise as a useful adjunct to standard sonographic imaging. MRN refers to the optimization of magnetic resonance image sequences and technology for visualization and contrasting nerves from surrounding structures. MRN provides excellent soft tissue contrast, depicts the entire nerve in 3 dimensions, allows for early evaluation of downstream muscle injury, and functions without operator dependency limits. Images provide details of nerve anatomic relationships, congruency, size, fascicular pattern, local and intrinsic fluid status, and contrast enhancement patterns, making MRN particularly useful in the setting of trauma, tumor, compressive lesions, and evaluation of brachial plexus injuries. Advances in MR volume and cinematic rendering software, magnet and coil technology, nerve-specific contrast media, and diffusion-weighted and tensor imaging will likely continue to expand the clinical application and indications for MRN. © 2019 American Society for Surgery of the Hand

AB  - Assessment of myelin integrity in peripheral nerve injuries and pathologies has largely been limited to post-mortem analysis owing to the difficulty in obtaining biopsies without affecting nerve function. This is further encumbered by the small size of the tissue and its location. Therefore, the development of robust, non-invasive methods is highly attractive. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), to longitudinally and non-invasively characterize both the sciatic nerve crush and lysolecithin (LCP) demyelination models of peripheral nerve injury in rodents. Electrophysiological, gene expression and histological assessments complemented the extensive MRI analyses in young and aged animals. In the nerve crush model, MTR analysis indicated a slower recovery in regions distal to the site of injury in aged animals, as well as incomplete recovery at six weeks post-crush when analyzing across the entire nerve surface. Similar regional impairments were also found in the LCP demyelination model. This research underlines the power of MTR for the study of peripheral nerve injury in small tissues such as the sciatic nerve of rodents and contributes new knowledge to the effect of aging on recovery after injury. A particular advantage of the approach is the translational potential to human neuropathies. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Diabetic neuropathy is the commonest chronic disabling complication of diabetes which may lead to amputation and compromising patient's quality of life. It is characterized by pain, sensation loss associated with neural edema. Diffusion tensor imaging parameter i.e. fraction anisotropy determines the free water proton diffusion in the healthy nerve. Since the diabetes leads to altered mechanosensitivity of the posterior tibial nerve thereby, might interferes with the water molecules movement. Therefore the present clinical trial will provide the evidence of improving the diffusion tensor imaging in the diabetic neuropathy directly by targeting the nerve through nerve mobilization treatment. Methods: Participants with Type II Diabetes Mellitus induced peripheral neuropathy will be selected randomly on the basis of eligibility criteria and informed consent will be taken. Participants will be recruited into three groups. Group A (experimental group A) will receive neural mobilization technique, Group B (experimental group B) will receive conventional therapy and Group C (control group) will receive sham treatment for 3 weeks. MRI technique, Visual analogue scale and neuropathy specific quality of life questionnaire will be used as assessment tools. Assessment will be taken at baseline and post intervention. Conclusion: this clinical trial will provide the evidence of efficacy of nerve mobilization in determining the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes in the posterior tibial nerve in patients with diabetic neuropathy. This trial will also be the first one in itself to look at the treatment induced DTI changes in the peripheral nerve.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a common dose-limiting side effect of several anticancer medications. CIPN may involve multiple areas of the peripheral nervous system from the autonomic and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) to the axon and any peripheral nerve fibre type. Large diameter sensory myelinated (Aβ) fibres are more frequently involved, but motor, small myelinated (Ad), unmyelinated (C) or autonomic fibres may also be affected. Here, we review the current evidence on techniques for the CIPN assessment in the clinical and experimental settings. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) may be used at the subclinical and early CIPN stage, to assess the extent of large nerve fibre damage and to monitor long-term outcomes, with the sural or dorsal sural nerve as the most informative. The quantitative sensory neurological examination provides valuable data alongside NCS. Quantitative sensory testing and nerve excitability studies add information regarding pathophysiology. Nerve MRI and ultrasound may provide information on enlarged nerve, increased nerve signal intensity and DRG or spinal cord changes. Skin biopsy, corneal confocal microscopy, laser-evoked potentials, contact heat-related potentials and microneurography may reveal the extent of damage to small unmyelinated nerve fibres that go undetected by NCS. The information on the role of these latter techniques is preliminary. Hence, the use of multimodal testing is recommended as the optimal CIPN assessment strategy, employing objective NCS and other specialised techniques together with subjective patient-reported outcome measures. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - AIM: To assess differences in bilateral great occipital nerves (GONs) in patients with unilateral cervicogenic headache (CEH) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with unilateral CEH underwent GON magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The clinical characteristics and fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in bilateral GONs were determined by two observers with 7 and 3 years of experience in MRI. Three segments of GON were defined based on anatomy. The correlation of DTI measurements to the clinical characteristics and inter-/intra-observer performance were also evaluated. RESULTS: The mean GON FA for the symptomatic side was significantly lower (0.198±0.056) than that on the other side (0.311±0.04; p=0.000). The mean GON ADC for the symptomatic side was significantly higher (0.682±0.174) than that on the other side (0.465±0.138; p=0.000). Among the three defined segments of GON, statistically significant differences of ADC values were not found at segment S3 (0.692±0.257 versus 0.557±0.230; p=0.068). There were statistically significant differences of FA and ADC values in bilateral GON of segments S1 and S2. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of intra-/interobserver statistical analysis showed excellent inter/intra-observer agreement for FA and ADC. Significant correlation was only found between the duration and ADC. CONCLUSION: In patients with unilateral CEH, quantitative evaluation of the GON using DTI demonstrated FA decreases and ADC increases of the symptomatic side. Larger population and other occipital nerve neuropathy can be included in future research. © 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists

AB  - Electroacupuncture (EA) is an adjuvant therapy for peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Both peripheral and central alterations contribute to the rehabilitation process. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the diffusion plasticity of afferent and efferent pathways caused by EA in model of peripheral nerve injury and reparation. Twenty-four rats were divided into three groups: normal group, model group and intervention group. Rats of the model group and the intervention group underwent sciatic nerve transection and anastomosis. EA intervention was performed on the intervention group at ST-36 and GB-30 for three months. Gait assessment and DTI were conducted at days post-operative (DPO) 30, 60 and 90. We selected corticospinal tract, spinothalamic tract and internal capsule as regions of interest and analyzed diffusion metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). FA values and RD values displayed significant differences or obvious tendency while AD values maintained a stable level. RD values displayed better indicative performance than FA in internal capsule. The intervention group presented significant correlation between RD values and Regularity Index (RI) during the intervention period. The effect of EA on peripheral nerve injury repairing rats appeared to be accelerated recovery process of sensory and motor neural pathway. We proposed that RD was a potential in vivo indicator for structural plasticity caused by EA and PNI. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: To qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the nerves of patients with diabetic amyotrophy (DA) using magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Materials and methods: Forty controls and 13 DA cases were analyzed. 1.5-Tesla and 3.0-Tesla MRN with DTI was used. Qualitative data from 13 patient records were recorded. Region of interest (ROI) measurements were taken of bilateral L3 through S2 lumbosacral nerve roots, femoral nerves, and sciatic nerves. An ANOVA and multiple linear regression analysis were performed. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated between two readers. Results: In DA cases, abnormalities of the lumbosacral nerve roots (n = 11 patients), sciatic (n = 10), femoral (n = 13), and obturator nerves (n = 4) were seen; denervation changes of the abdominopelvic muscles were also identified. Quantitatively, minimum and mean nerve signals on B600 were significantly less than controls (p < 0.001). Minimum and mean ADC values were significantly greater in cases than in controls (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively). Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values were significantly lower in cases than in controls (p = 0.041). There were no significant differences in the minimum FA values between cases and controls. Minimum and mean ADCs correlated positively with highest recorded hemoglobin A1 (HbA1c) while controlling for sex, age, and BMI (β = 0.518, p < 0.001 and β = 0.302, p = 0.020 respectively). ICCs were 0.892 (B600), 0.717 (ADC), and 0.730 (FA). Conclusion: Neuromuscular lesions secondary to DA are qualitatively and quantitatively identified on MRN with DTI, and a positive correlation of ADC levels with serum HbA1c levels exists. Thus, MRN with DTI can be employed as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, if DA is suspected. © 2019, ISS.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used extensively in revealing pathological changes in the central nervous system. However, to date, MRI is very much underutilized in evaluating the peripheral nervous system (PNS). This underutilization is generally due to two perceived weaknesses in MRI: First, the need for very high resolution to image the small structures within the peripheral nerves to visualize morphological changes; second, the lack of normative data in MRI of the PNS and this makes reliable interpretation of the data difficult. This article reviews current state-of-the-art capabilities in in vivo MRI of human peripheral nerves. It aims to identify areas where progress has been made and those that still require further improvement. In particular, with many new therapies on the horizon, this review addresses how MRI can be used to provide non-invasive and objective biomarkers in the evaluation of peripheral neuropathies. Although a number of techniques are available in diagnosing and tracking pathologies in the PNS, those techniques typically target the distal peripheral nerves, and distal nerves may be completely degenerated during the patient’s first clinic visit. These techniques may also not be able to access the proximal nerves deeply embedded in the tissue. Peripheral nerve MRI would be an alternative to circumvent these problems. In order to address the pressing clinical needs, this review closes with a clinical protocol at 3T that will allow high-resolution, high-contrast, quantitative MRI of the proximal peripheral nerves. © 2019 Chen Y et al.

AB  - We present the clinicopathologic conference of a 34-year-old lady with history of facial palsy 14 years ago who developed new deficits of mononeuritis multiplex, maculopapular rash, pancytopenia, splenomegaly, lung involvement and cognitive decline rapidly over three years. Investigations revealed pancytopenia, reversal of albumin globulin ratio, mediastinal adenopathy, ANA positivity, low C3 levels with the CSF being inflammatory and MRI showing extensive hemorrhagic lesions with mass effect. She had a rapidly progressive fatal course over three years with the disease being undiagnosed. This case was presented in the annual meeting of the Indian Academy of Neurology in September 2018. © 2006 - 2019 Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used as a problem-solving tool for diagnosis and management of peripheral neuropathies. This review is aimed at summarizing important technological advances, including MR pulse sequence and surface coil developments, which have facilitated MRN’s use in clinical practice. Recent Findings: The most recent research in MRN focuses on its clinical applications, with concomitant development of three-dimensional, parallel imaging and vascular suppression techniques that facilitate higher spatial resolution and depiction of small nerve branches arising from the brachial and lumbosacral plexi as well as fascicular abnormalities of more distal extremity nerves. Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been studied as a tool to detect microstructural abnormalities of peripheral nerves and more precisely define grades of nerve injury but will require additional investigation to determine its role in daily clinical practice. Summary: MRN continues to evolve due to technological improvements and awareness by the medical community of its capabilities. Additional technological developments related to surface coil designs and vascular suppression techniques will be needed to move the field forward. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose of reviewSingle-organ vasculitis of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is often designated nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN). Several variants or subtypes have been distinguished, including migratory sensory neuropathy, postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy, diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies, skin-nerve vasculitides, and, arguably, neuralgic amyotrophy. NSVN often presents as nondiabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (LRPN). This review updates classification, clinical features, epidemiology, and imaging of these disorders.Recent findingsA recent study showed the annual incidence of LRPN in Olmstead County, Minnesota to be 4.16/100000:2.79/100000 diabetic and 1.27/100000 nondiabetic. This study was the first to determine the incidence or prevalence of any vasculitic neuropathy. In NSVN, ultrasonography shows multifocal enlargement of proximal and distal nerves. In neuralgic amyotrophy, MRI and ultrasound reveal multifocal enlargements and focal constrictions in nerves derived from the brachial plexus. Histopathology of these chronic lesions shows inflammation and rare vasculitis. Diffusion tensor imaging of tibial nerves in NSVN revealed decreased fractional anisotropy in one study.SummarySingle-organ PNS vasculitides are the most common inflammatory neuropathies. Neuralgic amyotrophy might result from PNS vasculitis, but further study is necessary. The usefulness of focal nerve enlargements or constrictions in understanding pathological mechanisms, directing biopsies, and monitoring disease activity in NSVN should be further investigated. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Neuropathy, typically diagnosed by the presence of either symptoms or signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction, remains a frequently reported complication in the antiretroviral (ART)-treated HIV population. This study was conducted in 109 healthy controls and 57 HIV-infected individuals to investigate CNS regions associated with neuropathy. An index of objective neuropathy was computed based on 4 measures: deep tendon ankle reflex, vibration sense (great toes), position sense (great toes), and 2-point discrimination (feet). Subjective neuropathy (self-report of pain, aching, or burning; pins and needles; or numbness in legs or feet) was also evaluated. Structural MRI data were available for 126/166 cases. The HIV relative to the healthy control group was impaired on all 4 signs of neuropathy. Within the HIV group, an objective neuropathy index of 1 (bilateral impairment on 1 measure) or 2 (bilateral impairment on at least 2/4 measures) was associated with older age and a smaller volume of the cerebellar vermis. Moderate to severe symptoms of neuropathy were associated with more depressive symptoms, reduced quality of life, and a smaller volume of the parietal precuneus. This study is consistent with the recent contention that ART-treated HIV-related neuropathy has a CNS component. Distinguishing subjective symptoms from objective signs of neuropathy allowed for a dissociation between the precuneus, a brain region involved in conscious information processing and the vermis, involved in fine tuning of limb movements.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of 18F-FDG PET/MRI in two different peripheral neuropathic pain models using the injured rat sciatic nerves. Twelve rats, with operation on left sciatic nerves, were evenly divided into three groups: sham surgery (control group), crushing injury and chronic constriction injury (CCI) (experimental groups). The nerve damage was assessed at 3 weeks postoperatively using following methods: paw withdrawal threshold values (RevWT), maximum standardized uptake values on PET/MRI images (SUVR), and counting the number of myelinated axons in proximal and distal sites of nerve injury (MAxR). The results were quantified and statistically analyzed. Compared to the control group, the crushing injury demonstrated significant differences in RevWT (p &lt; 0.0001) and SUVR (p = 0.027) and the CCI group demonstrated significant differences in RevWT (p &lt; 0.0001), SUVR (p = 0.001) and MAxR (p = 0.048). There were no significant differences between the two experimental groups for all assessments. Correlation analysis demonstrated that RevWT and SUVR assessments were highly correlated (r = -− 0.710, p = 0.010), and SUVR and MAxR were highly correlated (r = 0.611, p = 0.035). However, there was no significant correlation between RevWT and MAxR. The PET scan may be a valuable imaging modality to enable noninvasive, objective diagnosis of neuropathic pain caused by peripheral nerve injury. Also, MRI fused with PET may help clarify the anatomic location of soft tissue structures, including the peripheral nerves. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: To show the interest of tractography in pelvic surgery by a demonstrative case of neurofibroma resected by robotic assisted laparoscopy. Summary background data: Although diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, along with tractography algorithms, is increasingly included in image guided neurosurgery methods, it is less frequently used for the peripheral nervous system such as the pelvic sacral plexus. We report one observation demonstrating the interest of such image data for pelvic surgery. Methods: A 12-years-old girl with neurofibromatosis presented with a growing left pelvic neurofibroma on repeated pelvic MRI with an increased SUV (2.83) on PET scan. A diffusion tensor pelvic MRI was performed before and after robotically assisted tumoral resection, and a tractography algorithm was applied on both images. Results: The pre-operative tractogram showed the nervous nature of the tumor in close contact with the left sacral plexus. Section of a nerve trunk encased in the neurofibroma was mandatory for the resection and well documented by the 3D enhanced vision provided by the robot. Post-operatively, the patient showed a slight paresthesia and dysesthesia of the left leg calf and of the plantar vault (left S2 territory), without any motor deficit. The post-operative tractogram showed a thinning of the left S2 sacral root and the disappearance of right aberrant nervous tracts. Conclusions: This clinical case validates the ability of pelvic tractography to deliver a proper imaging of the sacral nervous network and emphasizes the potential usefulness of this approach in pelvic surgery management, with perspectives of image-guided surgery. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - In pediatric patients, peripheral anesthetic blockade of the sciatic nerve is useful for postoperative pain relief after orthopedic procedures of the lower limb. The identification of the sciatic and its branches relative to the surrounding anatomical structures of the knee significantly contribute to the successful nerve blockade. However, reports have demonstrated complications arising from the inadequate and inconsistent understanding of the anatomy of the nerves in the knee region. In addition, the paucity of information regarding the location of the nerves of the knee throughout the pediatric development needs to be addressed in order for peripheral nerve blockades to become more readily used among the pediatric population. This clinical imaging study therefore aimed to document and analyze the relative morphometric relationship of the nerves in the knee region throughout the different stages of pediatric development. The locations of the sciatic, tibial, and common fibular nerves were measured in relation to relevant anatomical structures in 142 pediatric magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. A strong correlation was found between age and the distance from the common fibular nerve to the semitendinosus muscle, and thus can be used to predict stature. Significant differences were found between males and females, specifically after puberty, suggesting that sexual dimorphism emerges more distinctively at puberty. In order to predict the location of the nerves at the popliteal fossa, a regression formula using the patient's age and bicondylar width was created. These finding may have significant implications for popliteal approach of the sciatic nerve blockade in pediatric patients. Clin.

AB  - Background: A wide range of specificity values for the differentiation of benign and malignant soft-tissue tumors show the limitations of conventional MRI features. The data obtained by quantitative analysis of diffusion-weighted image (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRIs would provide more objective results, especially in terms of cellularity and perfusion. Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic efficacies of DWI and DCE MRI for the differentiation of malignant and benign soft-tissue tumors. Study Type: Retrospective. Subjects: In all, 136 patients (68 females, 68 males; age range 18–86 years, mean age 57.2 years) with soft-tissue tumors. Field Strength/Sequence: 3 T, DWI, DCE. Assessment: Tumor sizes, margins, locations, the presence of involvement in bone or neurovascular bundle, peritumoral edema, heterogeneity, and tumor necrosis were investigated on conventional MR images. On DWIs, visual signal drops were assessed and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values were measured. Ktrans, Kep, Ve, and iAUC values, and time–concentration curve (TCC) types were determined using DCE images. Statistical Tests: The data were statistically analyzed to determine the abilities to differentiate benign and malignant tumors using the chi-square test, two-sample t-test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Seventy-three cases were malignant and 63 benign. Age (mean ages of benign/malignant tumors, 51.75/61.86 years; P = 0.0002) and gender (F:M = 40:23 [benign], F:M = 28:45 [malignant], P = 0.003) influenced the distinction between benign and malignant. Sizes, margins, neurovascular bundle involvement, peritumoral edema, and heterogeneity of the tumors on conventional MR images and DCE parameters (Ktrans, Kep, Ve, and iAUC, and TCC plots) obtained from focal region of interest within a narrow volume of interest significantly differentiated benign and malignant lesions (all P &lt; 0.0001, except Ve [P = 0.0004]). For DWI with ADC mapping, all ADC values and visually signal drops were also significant (P &lt; 0.0001). Data Conclusion: DWI and DCE-MRI and derived variables were significantly helpful in discriminating benign and malignant soft-tissue tumors complementary to conventional MRI. Level of Evidence: 3.

AB  - ObjectiveTo characterize and quantify peripheral nerve lesions and muscle degeneration in clinically, genetically, and electrophysiologically well-classified, nonpediatric patients with 5q-linked spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN).MethodsThirty-one adult patients with genetically confirmed 5q-linked SMA types II, IIIa, and IIIb and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were prospectively investigated. All patients received neurologic, physiotherapeutic, and electrophysiologic assessments. MRN at 3.0T with anatomic coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to the tibiotalar joint was performed with dual-echo 2D relaxometry sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3D T2-weighted inversion recovery sequence. Detailed quantification of nerve injury by morphometric and microstructural MRN markers and qualitative classification of fatty muscle degeneration were conducted.ResultsEstablished clinical scores and compound muscle action potentials discriminated well between the 3 SMA types. MRN revealed that peroneal and tibial nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) at the thigh and lower leg level as well as spinal nerve CSA were markedly decreased throughout all 3 groups, indicating severe generalized peripheral nerve atrophy. While peroneal and tibial nerve T2 relaxation time was distinctly increased at all analyzed anatomic regions, the proton spin density was clearly decreased. Marked differences in fatty muscle degeneration were found between the 3 groups and for all analyzed compartments.ConclusionsMRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve involvement in SMA types II, IIIa, and IIIb with high sensitivity in vivo. Quantitative MRN parameters (T2 relaxation time proton spin density, CSA) might serve as novel imaging biomarkers in SMA to indicate early microstructural nerve tissue changes in response to treatment. © American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to provide normal reference values for quantitative parameters for brachial and lumbosacral plexi on multimodal MRI. In addition, the parameter variations between the left and right sides, the individual nerve groups, genders and age groups were also evaluated. Materials and methods: Multimodal MRI was evaluated in 163 healthy subjects, who were randomly divided into three groups: brachial plexus, lumbosacral plexus and diffusion tensor imaging groups. Nerve diameters, contrast ratios, T2 nerve-muscle signal ratios (nT2), fractional anisotropy (FA)values and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC)were measured in both plexi. Parametric tests and Pearson correlation for normally distributed data, and non-parametric tests and Spearman correlation for non-normally distributed data were used. Results: There were no significant differences in parameters between the left and right sides. The diameters of the C7, L4-S1, sciatic, and femoral nerve roots were larger in men than in women (P < 0.05). The nT2 in the brachial and lumbosacral plexi and the contrast ratio in the lumbosacral plexus were significantly higher in the elderly. The diameter of the S1 nerve root was smaller in the elderly. There were no significant differences between the individual nerve groups in contrast ratios and in brachial plexus nT2. A gradual increase in the nT2 from the top to the bottom was observed in the L4-S1 nerve roots (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study provides multi-parameter normative data for the brachial and lumbosacral plexi while considering differences between the two sides, the individual nerves, genders, and the ages. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) account for ~ 5% of soft tissue neoplasms and are responsible for a wide spectrum of morbidities ranging from localized neuropathy to fulminant metastatic spread and death. MR imaging represents the gold standard for identification of these neoplasms, however, current anatomic MR imaging markers do not reliably detect or differentiate benign and malignant lesions, and therefore, biopsy or excision is required for definitive diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) serves as a useful tool in the evaluation and management of PNSTs by providing functional information regarding the degree of diffusion, while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) aids in determining the directional information of predominant diffusion and has been shown to be particularly useful for pre-operative planning of these tumors by delineating healthy and pathologic fascicles. The article focuses on these important neurogenic lesions, highlighting the current utility of diffusion MR imaging and future directions including computerized radiomic analysis. Key Points: • Anatomic MRI is moderately accurate in differentiating benign from malignant PNST. • Diffusion tensor imaging facilitates pre-operative planning of PNSTs by depicting neuropathy and tractography. • Radiomics will likely augment current observer-based diagnostic criteria for PNSTs. © 2018, European Society of Radiology.

AB  - European Radiology Experimental reached the first 100 articles published in two years. Rejection rate was 30%, publication rate increased from 3.5/month in the first 12-month period to 4.8/month in the second 12-month period. The journal metrics were: 25 days from submission to first decision, 96 days from submission to acceptance, and 69 days from acceptance to publication. At the end of May 2019, we accumulated a total of 82,367 article accesses, 541 Altmetric score, and 110 citations for 92 published articles. Europe accounted for 85% of article origin. One third of corresponding authors were not radiologists/radiology residents, but were rather mainly physicists, engineers, or computer scientists. The distribution among subspecialties/body parts was well balanced; 9% of the topics regarded patient's safety, radioprotection, or contrast media. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) accounted for 71% of the articles. Twenty-two percent of original articles/technical notes reported on animal models, 15% on phantoms, 3% on in silico, 2% on human cadavers, and 2% on cells. Nine articles regarded artificial intelligence and/or radiomics, and 2 regarded augmented reality. Of 100 articles, 57 declared funding sources. A total of 517 independent reviews were performed by 92 reviewers. The five articles quoted the most regarded augmented reality, spectral photon-counting CT, artificial intelligence, MRI radiomics, and diffusion tensor imaging of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems. The journal is complying with aims and scope of its "experimental" profile.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful radiologic tool with the ability to generate a variety of proton-based signal contrast from tissues. Owing to this immense flexibility in signal generation, new MRI techniques are constantly being developed, tested, and optimized for clinical utility. In addition, the safe and nonionizing nature of MRI makes it a suitable modality for imaging in children. In this review article, we summarize a few of the most popular advances in MRI techniques in recent years. In particular, we highlight how these new developments have affected brain, spine, and neuromuscular imaging and focus on their applications in pediatric patients. In the first part of the review, we discuss new approaches such as multiphase and multidelay arterial spin labeling for quantitative perfusion and angiography of the brain, amide proton transfer MRI of the brain, MRI of brachial plexus and lumbar plexus nerves (i.e., neurography), and T2 mapping and fat characterization in neuromuscular diseases. In the second part of the review, we focus on describing new data acquisition strategies in accelerated MRI aimed collectively at reducing the scan time, including simultaneous multislice imaging, compressed sensing, synthetic MRI, and magnetic resonance fingerprinting. In discussing the aforementioned, the review also summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each method and their current state of commercial availability from MRI vendors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: One of the main goals of novel, noninvasive imaging techniques like high-resolution nerve ultrasound (HRUS) and corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) is the prediction of treatment response for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Methods: A total of 17 patients with CIDP were examined prospectively at baseline and every 9 months over a period of 18 months using CCM to quantify corneal nerve degeneration markers and immune cell infiltration as well as HRUS to detect changes of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the peripheral nerves. Additionally, skin biopsy of the distal and proximal leg as well as quantitative sensory testing were performed at the first follow-up visit. Results: A value of more than 30 total corneal cells/mm2 in CCM at baseline identified patients with clinical progression with a sensitivity/specificity of 100% in our cohort. Corneal nerve fiber density and length remained low and stable over the study period and intra-epidermal fiber density was markedly reduced in the majority of the patients. Furthermore, an increase in Bochum ultrasound score (BUS), which summarizes the CSA of the ulnar nerve in Guyons’ canal, the ulnar nerve in the upper arm, the radial nerve in the spiral groove and the sural nerve between the gastrocnemius muscle, and a maximum BUS of 4 at study initiation identified patients with disease progression (sensitivity 80%, specificity 88%). Conclusions: BUS and corneal total cell infiltration seem to represent early markers for clinical progression in CIDP, thus having the potential to identify at-risk patients and impact treatment decisions. © The Author(s), 2019.

AB  - Purpose: To examine dorsal root ganglia and proximal nerve segments in patients carrying the Fabry-related GLA-gene variant p.D313Y in comparison to patients with classical Fabry mutations and healthy controls by morphometric and functional magnetic resonance neurography. Methods: This prospective multicenter study examines the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve in 11 female p.D313Y patients by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3 T. Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3 to S2, permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1, and spinal nerve L5 as well as cross-sectional area of the sciatic nerve were assessed and compared to 10 females carrying a classical Fabry mutation and 16 healthy female controls. Results: Compared to healthy controls, dorsal root ganglia volumes of p.D313Y females were enlarged by 53% (L3), 48% (L4), 43% (L5), 57% (S1) (p < 0.001), and 55% (S2) (p < 0.05), but less pronounced compared to females carrying a classical Fabry mutation. Compared to healthy controls, p.D313Y patients showed no changes of dorsal root ganglia vascular permeability, while patients with a classical Fabry mutation showed a distinct decrease (p < 0.05). Sciatic nerve cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6% in p.D313Y as well as in classical Fabry patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Patients carrying the GLA-gene variant p.D313Y show distinctly enlarged dorsal root ganglia, while vascular permeability remains within normal limits. Overall, these alterations partially share characteristics commonly seen in patients with a mutation causing classical FD. This suggests that p.D313Y causes a potentially treatable condition resembling an early stage of Fabry disease. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: In this study we investigated the potential of magnetic resonance (MR) micro-neurography to detect morphological and relaxometric changes in distal tibial nerves in patients affected with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and their associations with clinical and electrophysiological features. Materials and methods: 10 subjects affected with CIDP and 10 healthy subjects were examined. Multiple MR parameters, including the number of fascicles (N), fascicles diameter (FD), total fascicles area (FA), epineurium area (EA), total nerve area (NA), fascicles to nerve ratio (FNR) and quantitative T2 and proton density (PD) were investigated on high resolution MR images of the distal tibial nerve. Those parameters were correlated with clinical scores, age of onset, disease duration and electrophysiologic data. Results: Median NA and FA were significantly increased in the CIDP population (median values for NA in cm2 in CIDP: 0.185; controls: 0.135; p: 0.028; for FA in CIDP 0.136; controls 0.094; p: 0.021). There was no correlation between the parameters investigated and clinical or electrophysiologic features. Conclusion: MR microneurography can detect increased total nerve and fascicle area in distal tibial nerves in CIDP and may be useful for diagnosing CIDP. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Lowering serum cholesterol levels is a well-established treatment for dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, nerve lesions in patients with T2D increase with lower serum cholesterol levels, suggesting that lowering serum cholesterol levels is associated with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in patients with T2D. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether there is an association between serum cholesterol levels and peripheral nerve lesions in patients with T2D with and without DPN. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study was performed from June 1, 2015, to March 31, 2018. Observers were blinded to clinical data. A total of 256 participants were approached, of whom 156 were excluded. A total of 100 participants consented to undergo magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg at the Department of Neuroradiology and clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic assessment at the Department of Endocrinology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. EXPOSURES Quantification of the nerve's diameter and lipid equivalent lesion (LEL) load with a subsequent analysis of all acquired clinical and serologic data with use of 3.0-Tmagnetic resonance neurography of the right leg with 3-dimensional reconstruction of the sciatic nerve. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was lesion load and extension. Secondary outcomes were clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic findings. RESULTS A total of 100 participants with T2D (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [0.9] years; 68 [68.0%] male) participated in the study. The LEL load correlated positively with the nerve's mean cross-sectional area (r = 0.44; P < .001) and the maximum length of a lesion (r = 0.71; P < .001). The LEL load was negatively associated with total serum cholesterol level (r = -0.41; P < .001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = -0.30; P = .006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = -0.33; P = .003), nerve conduction velocities of the tibial (r = -0.33; P = .01) and peroneal (r = -0.51; P < .001) nerves, and nerve conduction amplitudes of the tibial (r = -0.31; P = .02) and peroneal (r = -0.28; P = .03) nerves. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings suggest that lowering serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D and DPN is associated with a higher amount of nerve lesions and declining nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes. These findings may be relevant to emerging therapies that promote an aggressive lowering of serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D. © 2019 JAMA Network Open.All right reserved.

AB  - Background: The development of a noninvasive, objective, and accurate method to assess peripheral nerve disorders in Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS) is of clinical significance. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to evaluate some peripheral nerve disorders. Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of DTI in evaluating the peripheral nerve disorders in patients with GBS. Study Type: Case control. Subjects: Twenty GBS patients and 16 healthy volunteers. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T, T 1 WI-SE, T 2 WI-SPAIR, DTI; electrophysiology. Assessment: MRI data were analyzed by two radiologists blindly and independently. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusion coefficient (AD), and radial diffusion coefficient (RD) values of tibial nerve (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were recorded. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) and motor nerve conduction amplitude of TN and CPN were recorded. Statistical Tests: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), t-test, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC) analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: The FA and AD values of TN and CPN in the GBS group were significantly lower and the ADC and RD values were higher than those in the controls (P &lt;0.05). The AUC of the FA values (0.970 for TN and 0.927 for CPN) were higher than that of the ADC, AD, and RD values. FA and AD values were positively correlated and ADC, RD values were negatively correlated with MCV and motor nerve conduction amplitude, respectively (P &lt;0.05). The correlations between FA value and electrophysiology parameters were the highest. Data Conclusion: DTI quantitative parameters could evaluate the disorders of peripheral nerves in patients with GBS. A moderate correlation was observed between DTI and electrophysiology parameters.

AB  - Background: This study explores whether objective, quantitative radiomic biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance (MR), positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT) may be useful in reliably distinguishing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN). Methods: A registration and segmentation pipeline was established using a cohort of NF1 patients with histopathological diagnosis of PN or MPNST, and medical imaging of the PN including MR and PET-CT. The corrected MR datasets were registered to the corresponding PET-CT via landmark-based registration. PET standard-uptake value (SUV) thresholds were used to guide segmentation of volumes of interest: MPNST-associated PET-hot regions (SUV ≥ 3.5) and PN-associated PET-elevated regions (2.0 < SUV < 3.5). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from the MR, PET, and CT data and compared for statistical differences. Intensity histogram features included (mean, media, maximum, variance, full width at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and skewness), while image texture was quantified using Law's texture energy measures, grey-level co-occurrence matrices, and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices. Results: For each of the 20 NF1 subjects, a total of 320 features were extracted from the image data. Feature reduction and statistical testing identified 9 independent radiomic biomarkers from the MR data (4 intensity and 5 texture) and 4 PET (2 intensity and 2 texture) were different between the PET-hot versus PET-elevated volumes of interest. Conclusions: Our data suggests imaging features can be used to distinguish malignancy in NF1-realted tumors, which could improve MPNST risk assessment and positively impact clinical management of NF1 patients. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Background: Diagnosis and disease monitoring of non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN) are based on electrophysiological and clinical measures. However, these methods are insensitive to detect subtle differences of axonal injury. We here assessed the utility of a multiparametric MRI protocol to quantify axonal injury and neurogenic muscle damage in NSVN. Methods: Ten NSVN patients and ten age-matched controls were investigated in this single-center prospective study. All participants were assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the tibial nerve and multiecho Dixon MRI of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. These data were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological data. Results: DTI scans of the tibial nerves of patients with NSVN showed significantly lower mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values (0.32 ± 0.02) compared to healthy controls (0.42 ± 0.01). FA values of NSVN patients correlated negatively with clinical measures of pain. Multiecho Dixon MRI scans revealed significantly higher intramuscular fat fractions in the soleus muscle (19.86 ± 6.18% vs. 5.86 ± 0.74%, p = 0.0015) and gastrocnemius muscle (26.09 ± 6.21% vs. 3.59 ± 0.82%, p = 0.0002) in NSVN patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: Our data provide a proof of concept that MRI can render information about nerve integrity and muscle pathology in NSVN. Further studies are warranted to evaluate DTI and multiecho Dixon MRI as surrogate markers in NSVN. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Hinman syndrome is a rare disease with urodynamic findings and a clinical course resembling neuropathic bladder, without a neuropathic etiology. Diffusion tensor imaging is a special technique of magnetic resonance imaging that has recently been used to evaluate the peripheral nerves but has been demonstrated to be applicable for evaluation of the lumbosacral plexus. We examined the lumbosacral plexus using diffusion tensor imaging, which has not previously been reported in patients with Hinman syndrome. Materials and Methods: The study included 12 patients who fulfilled criteria for Hinman syndrome, with severe bladder dysfunction on urodynamics, renal scarring on scintigraphy and no pathological findings on magnetic resonance imaging. The 12 subjects serving as controls required pelvic or spinal magnetic resonance imaging for reasons other than spinal abnormalities. Evaluation was performed with a 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system and 16-channel body coil. Tractography was done to examine the lumbosacral plexus. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were computed and compared between groups for the right and left plexuses. Results: Mean fractional anisotropy was 0.24 and 0.35 for the right plexus in patients and controls, respectively, and 0.24 and 0.36 for the left plexus. Mean diffusivity was 1.39 for the right and left plexuses in patients, and 1.28 for the right and left plexuses in controls (p <0.001 for all). Conclusions: Our study focusing on the lumbosacral plexus as a possible origin of neuropathy revealed abnormal findings in patients with Hinman syndrome resembling nerve injury series. This is the first known study to provide data showing that Hinman syndrome may have a neuropathic etiology. © 2019 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

AB  - Background. We sought to determine the value of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for characterization of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Methods. Twenty-six patients with NF1 and suspicion of malignant transformation of PNSTs were prospectively enrolled and underwent DW MRI at 3T. For a set of benign (n = 55) and malignant (n = 12) PNSTs, functional MRI parameters were derived from both biexponential intravoxel incoherent motion (diffusion coefficient D and perfusion fraction f) and monoexponential data analysis (apparent diffusion coefficients [ADCs]). A panel of morphological MRI features was evaluated using T1- and T2-weighted imaging. Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher's exact test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative and qualitative MRI. Cohen's kappa was used to determine interrater reliability. Results. Malignant PNSTs demonstrated significantly lower diffusivity (P < 0.0001) compared with benign PNSTs. The perfusion fraction f was significantly higher in malignant PNSTs (P < 0.001). In ROC analysis, functional MRI parameters showed high diagnostic accuracy for differentiation of PNSTs (eg, ADCmean, 92% sensitivity with 98% specificity, AUC 0.98; Dmean, 92% sensitivity with 98% specificity, AUC 0.98). By contrast, morphological imaging features had only limited sensitivity (18-94%) and specificity (18-82%) for identification of malignancy. Interrater reliability was higher for monoexponential data analysis. Conclusion. DW imaging shows better diagnostic performance than morphological features and allows accurate differentiation of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1. © 2019 Society for Neuro-Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB  - Purpose: To establish normal values and to identify demographic determinants of quantitative biomarkers in magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Methods: In this study 60 healthy individuals (5 men and 5 women of every decade between 20 and 80 years) were examined according to a standardized MRN protocol at 3 T, including multiecho T2 relaxometry. Nerve cross-sectional area (CSA), transverse relaxation time (T2), and proton spin density (PSD) were assessed for the sciatic, tibial, median, ulnar, and radial nerves. Correlation with demographic variables, such as height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and age was expressed by Pearson coefficients and t‑tests were used to compare MRN biomarkers between men and women with and without normalization to body weight and BMI by linear regression. Results: The average nerve CSA correlated moderately with height (r = 0.28, p = 0.04), weight (r = 0.40, p = 0.002), and BMI (r = 0.35, p = 0.008), but not with age (r = 0.23, p = 0.09). While T2 did not correlate with demographic parameters, PSD was strongly inversely associated with BMI (r = −0.64, p < 0.001) and weight (r = −0.557, p < 0.001). Sex-dependent differences in imaging marker values were found for CSA but became negligible after normalization to body weight. Conclusion: Quantitative biomarkers of MRN co-vary with demographic variables. As particularly important determinants, we identified body weight for nerve CSA and BMI for PSD. The presented normal values and demographic determinants may assist investigations into the potential of MRN biomarkers in further disease-specific studies. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Background: Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) has recently been shown to accurately detect nerve injury and regeneration. This study assesses whether 7-tesla (7T) DTT imaging is a viable modality to observe axonal outgrowth in a 4 cm rabbit sciatic nerve injury model fixed by a reverse autograft (RA) surgical technique. Methods: Transection injury of unilateral sciatic nerve (4 cm long) was performed in 25 rabbits and repaired using a RA surgical technique. Analysis of the nerve autograft was performed at 3, 6, and 11 weeks postoperatively and compared to normal contralateral sciatic nerve, used as control group. High-resolution DTT from ex vivo sciatic nerves were obtained using 3D diffusion-weighted spin-echo acquisitions at 7-T. Total axons and motor and sensory axons were counted at defined lengths along the graft. Results: At 11 weeks, histologically, the total axon count of the RA group was equivalent to the contralateral uninjured nerve control group. Similarly, by qualitative DTT visualization, the 11-week RA group showed increased fiber tracts compared to the 3 and 6 weeks counterparts. Upon immunohistochemical evaluation, 11-week motor axon counts did not significantly differ between RA and control; but significantly decreased sensory axon counts remained. Nerves explanted at 3 weeks and 6 weeks showed decreased motor and sensory axon counts. Discussion: 7-T DTT is an effective imaging modality that may be used qualitatively to visualize axonal outgrowth and regeneration. This has implications for the development of technology that non-invasively monitors peripheral nerve regeneration in a variety of clinical settings. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is crucial to maintaining methylation during DNA replication and DNA repair. DNMT1 mutations have been identified in two neurological syndromes, including hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IE (HSAN IE) with dementia and hearing loss and autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness and narcolepsy. It is likely that DNMT1 mutations lead to various symptoms of the central and peripheral nervous system. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics, especially the initial symptoms, in the cases of DNMT1 mutations. Methods: We investigated the clinical manifestation and examination findings of four cases of HSAN IE from one family with the DNMT1 mutation c.1531Y>C (p.Try511His). Results: All four cases exhibited sensory neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and hearing loss, all of which were demonstrated by the audiograms. The initial symptoms of the four cases included hearing loss (n=1), gait disturbance (n=1), and depressive mood (n=2). Depressive symptoms are reported in some cases with HSAN IE, however, there are currently no published reports that describe them as primary symptoms. The CSF orexin level was measured in three cases, revealing normal values in two cases and intermediate values in one case, in which the patient exhibited rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that in cases with HSAN IE or the DNMT1 mutation, psychiatric symptoms should be taken into account as one of the initial manifestations of the disease. © 2019, ASEAN Neurological Association.

AB  - Evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries has classically been based on clinical and electrophysiologic criteria. US and MRI have been widely used for morphologic assessment of nerve injury sites and concomitant lesions. In the past few years, morphologic MR neurography has significantly increased its clinical applications on the basis of three-dimensional or two-dimensional images with and without fat-suppression techniques. However, these sequences have a major drawback: absence of pathophysiologic information about functional integrity or axonal flow of peripheral nerves. In this scenario, functional MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used as a complementary tool in initial evaluation of peripheral nerve trauma or in assessment of trauma undergoing surgical repair. These approaches provide not only morphologic but also functional information about extent and degree of nerve impairment. Functional MR neurography can also be applied to selection, planning, and monitoring of surgical procedures that can be performed after traumatic peripheral nerve injuries, such as neurorrhaphy, nerve graft, or neurolysis, as it provides surgeons with valuable information about the functional status of the nerves involved and axonal flow integrity. The physical basis of DWI and DTI and the technical adjustments required for their appropriate performance for peripheral nerve evaluation are reviewed. Also, the clinical value of DWI and DTI in assessment of peripheral nerve trauma is discussed, enhancing their potential impact on selection, planning, and monitoring of surgical procedures employed for peripheral nerve repair. © RSNA, 2019.

AB  - Background: Peripheral nerve injury is often followed by a highly variable recovery process with respect to both rapidity and efficacy. Identifying post-nerve injury phenomena is key to assessing the merit and timing of surgery as well as to tracking nerve recovery postoperatively. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has been investigated in the clinical and research settings as a noninvasive technique to both assess and monitor each patient's unique case of peripheral nerve damage. New method: We identify a MRI-suitable marker for tracking the exact site of either nerve injury or coaptation following surgical repair to aid with DTI analysis. Results: Due to artefact and disruption of tractography, silver wire and microvascular clips were not suitable markers. AxoGuard® 4-0 vicryl suture, and 10-0 polyamide suture, although detectable, did not produce a signal easily distinguished from post-surgical changes. Silicone was easily identifiable and stable in both the acute and delayed time points, exhibited negligible impact on DTI parameters, and possessed geometry to prevent nerve strangulation. Comparison with existing method: Prior studies have not assessed the efficacy of other markers nor have they assessed silicone for potential artefact with DTI parameter analysis. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the reliability and compatibility of silicone in the delayed postoperative time period and includes its unique imaging appearance on high-resolution 11.7 MRI. Conclusion: Semi-cylindrical silicone tubing can be used as a safe, reliable, and readily available radiological marker to visualize and monitor a region of interest on a rodent's peripheral nerve for aiding assessments with diffusion tensor imaging. © 2018

AB  - Purpose: Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is seen in up to 75% of treated cancer patients and can drastically limit their medical management and affect quality of life. Clinical and electrodiagnostic testing for CIPN have many pitfalls. Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used in the evaluation of peripheral nerves. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows promise in the workup of peripheral nerves. In this prospective pilot study, we investigated a possible relationship between DTI and peripheral neuropathy of the ankle and foot in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Methods: Nine cancer patients with and without CIPN were clinically evaluated using vibratory perception threshold (VPT) testing. VPT score of >25 Volts defined presence of CIPN. The posterior tibial nerve and branches in both feet were imaged using MRN and DTI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured at the posterior tibial, medial plantar, and lateral plantar nerves. Measurements for the CIPN group were compared to without CIPN by VPT cutoff. Correlations and possible relationships between DTI parameters and CIPN were analyzed. Results: A total of 16 feet of 9 enrolled patients were imaged (9 feet with CIPN and 7 feet without CIPN). Average age was 60.6 ± 13.4 years (range: 33-74). Posterior tibial nerve ADC values were significantly lower than the medial plantar nerve ADC values in all feet (F = 3.50, P = 0.04). We found a correlation with FA and ADC values at specific nerve locations with CIPN, with the left medial plantar nerve FA value and left lateral plantar nerve ADC value demonstrating the strongest positive correlations (0.73 and 0.62, respectively). Conclusions: The use of DTI for assessing CIPN is challenging but promising. This pilot study provides preliminary data showing correlations between FA and ADC measurements with CIPN and potential utility of DTI as a predictive marker of onset and severity of CIPN in the ankle and foot, which could aid in preventive strategies. Larger, prospective DTI studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Clinical Relevance: MRN with DTI shows promising results as a potential predictive marker of CIPN in the ankle and foot. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are critical for protein translation. Pathogenic variants of ARSs have been previously associated with peripheral neuropathy and multisystem disease in heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively. We report seven related children homozygous for a novel mutation in tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS, c.499C > A, p.Pro167Thr) identified by whole exome sequencing. This variant lies within a highly conserved interface required for protein homodimerization, an essential step in YARS catalytic function. Affected children expressed a more severe phenotype than previously reported, including poor growth, developmental delay, brain dysmyelination, sensorineural hearing loss, nystagmus, progressive cholestatic liver disease, pancreatic insufficiency, hypoglycemia, anemia, intermittent proteinuria, recurrent bloodstream infections and chronic pulmonary disease. Related adults heterozygous for YARS p.Pro167Thr showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy on electromyography, in contrast to previous reports for other YARS variants. Analysis of YARS p.Pro167Thr in yeast complementation assays revealed a loss-of-function, hypomorphic allele that significantly impaired growth. Recombinant YARS p.Pro167Thr demonstrated normal subcellular localization, but greatly diminished ability to homodimerize in human embryonic kidney cells. This work adds to a rapidly growing body of research emphasizing the importance of ARSs in multisystem disease and significantly expands the allelic and clinical heterogeneity of YARS-associated human disease. A deeper understanding of the role of YARS in human disease may inspire innovative therapies and improve care of affected patients. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Case series summary: This was a retrospective study on the clinical features and response to treatment in seven cats with feline hyperaesthesia syndrome (FHS) and tail mutilation. FHS is a poorly understood disorder characterised by skin rippling over the dorsal lumbar area, episodes of jumping and running, excessive vocalisation, and tail chasing and self-trauma. The majority of the cats were young, with a median age of 1 year at the onset of clinical signs, male (n = 6) and with access to the outdoors (n = 5). Multiple daily episodes of tail chasing and self-trauma were reported in five cats, with tail mutilation in four cats. Vocalisation during the episodes (n = 5) and rippling of lumbar skin (n = 5) were also reported. Haematology, serum biochemistry, Toxoplasma gondii and feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukaemia virus serology, MRI scans of brain, spinal cord and cauda equina, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electrodiagnostic tests did not reveal any clinically significant abnormalities. A definitive final diagnosis was not reached in any of the cats, but hypersensitivity dermatitis was suspected in two cases. A variety of medications was used alone or in combination, including gabapentin (n = 6), meloxicam (n = 4), antibiotics (n = 4), phenobarbital (n = 2), prednisolone (n = 2) and topiramate (n = 2); ciclosporin, clomipramine, fluoxetine, amitriptyline and tramadol were used in one cat each. Clinical improvement was achieved in six cases; in five cats complete remission of clinical signs was achieved with gabapentin alone (n = 2), a combination of gabapentin/ciclosporin/amitriptyline (n = 1), gabapentin/prednisolone/phenobarbital (n = 1) or gabapentin/topiramate/meloxicam (n = 1). Relevance and novel information: This is the first retrospective study on a series of cats with FHS. The diagnostic work-up did not reveal any significant abnormalities of the central or peripheral nervous system; dermatological and behavioural problems could not be ruled out. We propose an integrated multidisciplinary diagnostic pathway to be used for the management of clinical cases and for future prospective studies. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Due to the technical challenges of large-scale microscopy and analysis, to date only limited knowledge has been made available about axon morphometry (diameter, shape, myelin thickness, volume fraction), thereby limiting our understanding of neuronal microstructure and slowing down research on neurodegenerative pathologies. This study addresses this knowledge gap by establishing a state-of-the-art acquisition and analysis framework for mapping axon morphometry, and providing the first comprehensive mapping of axon morphometry in the human spinal cord. We dissected, fixed and stained a human spinal cord with osmium tetroxide, and used a scanning electron microscope to image the entirety of 23 axial slices, covering C1 to L5 spinal levels. An automatic method based on deep learning was then used to segment each axon and myelin sheath to produce maps of axon morphometry. These maps were then registered to a standard spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) template. Between 500,000 (lumbar) and 1 million (cervical) myelinated axons were segmented at each level of this human spinal cord. Morphometric features show a large disparity between tracts, but high right-left symmetry. Our results suggest a modality-based organization of the dorsal column in the human, as it has been observed in the rat. The generated axon morphometry template is publicly available at https://osf.io/8k7jr/ and could be used as a reference for quantitative MRI studies. The proposed framework for axon morphometry mapping could be extended to other parts of the central or peripheral nervous system that exhibit coherently-oriented axons. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective. The use of a biofabrication nerve scaffold, which mimics the nerve microstructure, as an alternative for autologous nerve transplantation is a promising strategy for treating peripheral nerve defects. This study aimed to design a customized biofabrication scaffold model with the characteristics of human peripheral nerve fascicles. Methods. We used Micro-MRI technique to obtain different nerve fascicles. A full-length 28 cm tibial nerve specimen was obtained and was divided into 14 two-centimetre nerve segments. 3D models of the nerve fascicles were obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction after image segmentation. The central line of the nerve fascicles was fitted, and the aggregation of nerve fascicles was analysed quantitatively. The nerve scaffold was designed by simulating the clinical nerve defect and extracting information from the acquired nerve fascicle data; the scaffold design was displayed by 3D printing to verify the accuracy of the model. Result. The microstructure of the sciatic nerve, tibial nerve, and common peroneal nerve in the nerve fascicles could be obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction. The number of cross fusions of tibial nerve fascicles from proximal end to distal end decreased gradually. By designing the nerve graft in accordance with the microstructure of the nerve fascicles, the 3D printed model demonstrated that the two ends of the nerve defect can be well matched. Conclusion. The microstructure of the nerve fascicles is complicated and changeable, and the spatial position of each nerve fascicle and the long segment of the nerve fascicle aggregation show great changes at different levels. Under the premise of the stability of the existing imaging techniques, a large number of scanning nerve samples can be used to set up a three-dimensional database of the peripheral nerve fascicle microstructure, integrating the gross imaging information, and provide a template for the design of the downstream nerve graft model. © 2019 Zhi Yao et al.

AB  - Migraine is a common disabling neurological disorder which is characterised by a recurring headache associated with a variety of sensory and autonomic symptoms. The pathophysiology of migraine remains not entirely understood, although many mechanisms involving the central and peripheral nervous system are now becoming clear. In particular, it is widely accepted that migraine is associated with energy metabolic impairment of the brain. The purpose of this review is to present an updated overview of the energy metabolism involvement in the migraine pathophysiology. Several biochemical, morphological and magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have confirmed the presence of energy production deficiency together with an increment of energy consumption in migraine patients. An increment of energy demand over a certain threshold creates metabolic and biochemical preconditions for the onset of the migraine attack. The defect of oxidative energy metabolism in migraine is generalized. It remains to be determined if the mitochondrial deficit in migraine is primary or secondary. Riboflavin and Co-Enzyme Q10, both physiologically implicated in mitochondrial respiratory chain functioning, are effective in migraine prophylaxis, supporting the hypothesis that improving brain energy metabolism may reduce the susceptibility to migraine. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Volumetric image segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) encounters several challenges, which are specific to medical images. Among these challenges are large volumes of interest, high class imbalances, and difficulties in learning shape representations. To tackle these challenges, we propose to improve over traditional CNN-based volumetric image segmentation through point-wise classification of point clouds. The sparsity of point clouds allows processing of entire image volumes, balancing highly imbalanced segmentation problems, and explicitly learning an anatomical shape. We build upon PointCNN, a neural network proposed to process point clouds, and propose here to jointly encode shape and volumetric information within the point cloud in a compact and computationally effective manner. We demonstrate how this approach can then be used to refine CNN-based segmentation, which yields significantly improved results in our experiments on the difficult task of peripheral nerve segmentation from magnetic resonance neurography images. By synthetic experiments, we further show the capability of our approach in learning an explicit anatomical shape representation. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Peripheral nerve imaging techniques have recently increasingly revealed their usefulness. We herein describe a man who had a subacute progression of symptom, diffuse and prominent proximal demyelination and conduction block, suggesting a diagnosis of inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Additional nerve imaging techniques revealed homogeneous and prominent nerve hypertrophy without proximal accentuation and the findings implied inherited polyneuropathies. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered, and both the symptoms of weakness and findings of nerve conduction studies (NCS) improved. Subsequent genetic testing unveiled Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1A. To diagnose peripheral nerve disorders, a careful history, physical examination and NCS are essential diagnostic tools, but the findings of this case suggest the importance of nerve imaging techniques in clinical situations. © 2019 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.

AB  - Objective: In this study we investigated the potential value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in characterizing changes in the cervical spinal cord and peripheral nerve roots in vivo in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Methods: We developed an MRI protocol with 4 sequences to investigate the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots on a 3 Tesla MRI system. We used 2 anatomical MRI sequences to investigate cross-sectional area (CSA) at each spinal segment and the diameter of ventral and dorsal nerve roots, and two diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques to estimate the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in 10 SMA patients and 20 healthy controls. Results: There were no significant differences in CSA (p > .1), although an 8.5% reduction of CSA in patients compared to healthy controls was apparent at segment C7. DTI data showed a higher AD in grey matter of patients compared to healthy controls (p = .033). Significantly lower MD, AD and RD values were found in rostral nerve roots (C3-C5) in patients (p < .045). Conclusions: We showed feasibility of an advanced 3 T MRI protocol that allowed differences to be determined between patients and healthy controls, confirming the potential of this technique to assess pathological mechanisms in SMA. After further development and confirmation of findings in a larger sample, these techniques may be used to study disease course of SMA in vivo and evaluate response to survival motor neuron (SMN) augmenting therapy. © 2019

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established tool in probing cortical plasticity in vivo. Changes in corticomotor excitability can be induced using paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which TMS over the primary motor cortex is conditioned with an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the contralateral hand. PAS with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms induces long-term potentiation (LTP)like effects in cortical excitability. However, the response to a PAS protocol tends to vary substantially across individuals. In this study, we used univariate and multivariate data-driven methods to investigate various previously proposed determinants of inter-individual variability in PAS efficacy, such as demographic, cognitive, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging measures. Forty-one right-handed participants, comprising 22 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 19 healthy controls (HC), underwent the PAS protocol. Prior to stimulation, demographic, genetic, clinical, as well as structural and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The two groups did not differ in any of the variables, except by global cognitive status. Univariate analysis showed that only 61% of all participants were classified as PAS responders, irrespective of group membership. Higher PAS response was associated with lower TMS intensity and with higher resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, but only in responders, as opposed to non-responders. We also found an overall positive correlation between PAS response and structural connectivity within the corticospinal tract, which did not differ between groups. A multivariate random forest (RF) model identified age, gender, education, IQ, global cognitive status, sleep quality, alertness, TMS intensity, genetic factors, and neuroimaging measures (functional and structural connectivity, gray matter (GM) volume, and cortical thickness as poor predictors of PAS response. The model resulted in low accuracy of the RF classifier (58%; 95% CI: 42 − 74%), with a higher relative importance of brain connectivity measures compared to the other variables. We conclude that PAS variability in our sample was not well explained by factors known to influence PAS efficacy, emphasizing the need for future replication studies.

AB  - Background Brachial plexus (BP) is composed of intercommunications among the ventral roots of the nerves C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 in the neck. The in vivo and in vitro evaluation of axons of the peripheral nervous system is performed using different techniques. Recently, many studies describing the application of fiber tractography and stereological axon number estimation to peripheral nerves have been published. Methods Various quantitative parameters of nerve fibers, including axon number, density, axonal area, and myelin thickness, can be estimated using stereological techniques. In vivo three-dimensional reconstruction of axons of BP can be visualized using a combined technique of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tracking with the potential to evaluate nerve fiber content. Conclusion It is concluded that terminal branches of BP can be successfully visualized using DTI, which is a highly reproducible method for the evaluation of BP as it shows anatomical and functional features of neural structures. We believe that quantitative morphological findings obtained from BP will be useful for new experimental, developmental, and pathological studies in the future. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.

AB  - Peripheral nerves can be affected by a variety of benign and malignant tumour and tumour-like lesions. Besides clinical evaluation and electrophysiologic studies, MRI is the imaging modality of choice for the assessment of these soft tissue tumours. Conventional MR sequences, however, can fail to assess the histologic features of the lesions. Moreover, the precise topographical relationship between the peripheral nerve and the tumor must be delineated preoperatively for complete tumour resection minimizing nerve damage. Using Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography, it is possible to obtain functional information on tumour and nerve structures, allowing the assess anatomy, function and biological features. In this article, we review the technical aspects and clinical application of DTI for the evaluation of peripheral nerve tumours. (www.actabiomedica.it). © 2019, Mattioli 1885. All rights reserved.

AB  - Schwannomatosis is a distinct syndrome characterized by multiple peripheral nerve schwannomas that can be sporadic or familial in nature. Cases affecting the lower cranial nerves are infrequent. Here, the authors present a rare case of schwannomatosis affecting the left spinal accessory nerve. Upon genetic screening, an in-frame insertion at codon p.R177 of the Sox 10 gene was observed. There were no identifiable alterations in NF1, NF2, LZTR1, and SMARCB1. This case demonstrates a rare clinical presentation of schwannomatosis in addition to a genetic aberration that has not been previously reported in this disease context. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart.

AB  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) adds functional information to morphological magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in the assessment of the brachial nerve plexus. To determine the most appropriate pulse sequence in scan times suited for diagnostic imaging in clinical routine, we compared image quality between simultaneous multi-slice readout-segmented (rs-DTI) and conventional single-shot (ss-DTI) echo-planar imaging techniques. Methods: Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved study including 10 healthy volunteers. The supraclavicular brachial plexus, covering the nerve roots and trunks from C5 to C7, was imaged on both sides with rs-DTI and ss-DTI. Both sequences were acquired in scan times <7 min with b-values of 900 s/mm2 and with isotropic spatial resolution. Results: In rs-DTI image, the overall quality was significantly better and distortion artifacts were significantly lower (P = 0.001-0.002 and P = 0.001-0.002, respectively) for both readers. In ss-DTI, a trend toward lower degree of ghosting and motion artifacts was elicited (reader 1, P = 0.121; reader 2, P = 0.264). No significant differences between the two DTI techniques were found for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), contrast- to-noise ratios (CNR) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (P ≥ 0.475, P ≥ 0.624, and P ≥ 0.169, respectively). Interreader agreement for all examined parameters and all sequences ranged from intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.064 to 0.905 and Kappa 0.40 to 0.851. Conclusion: Incomparable acquisition times rs-DTI showed higher image quality and less distortion artifacts than ss-DTI. The trend toward a higher degree of ghosting and motion artifacts in rs-DTI did not deteriorate image quality to a significant degree. Thus, rs-DTI should be considered for functional MRN of the brachial plexus. © 2018 Japanese Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

AB  - Background: The treatment efficacy after CyberKnife stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) have not been adequately addressed. The purpose of this study was to investigate pattern of recurrence according to irradiation field after CyberKnife SBRT for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: This retrospective study included patients with peripheral cT1/2N0M0 NSCLC that was treated with SBRT using a CyberKnife between May 2013 and March 2016 at single institute and followed up by more than two imaging examinations. Both operable and inoperable patients were included. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Cumulative incidence curves of recurrence were calculated and compared using the Gray's test. Results: Total 71 patients were included and analyzed in this study. The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 34 months (range, 7-64 months). The 2-year OS and PFS rate were 93% (95% CI: 83-97%) and 77% (95% CI: 65-86%), respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidence rate of infield recurrence and out-of-field recurrence were 6% (95% CI: 2-14%) and 17% (95% CI: 9-27%), respectively. Gross tumor volume (GTV) ≥9 mL and diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) ≥90 days were significantly associated with infield recurrence (P<0.001 and P=0.007), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation was significantly associated with out-of-field recurrence (P=0.014). Conclusions: Treatment efficacy after CyberKnife SBRT for peripheral early-stage NSCLC was identical to previous conventional linac-based SBRT reports. With short follow-up period, it was found that GTV and DTI were the significant predictive factor of infield recurrence, and EGFR mutation was the significant predictive factor of out-of-field recurrence. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

AB  - Purpose: By applying diffusor tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with anterior interosseous nerve syndrome (AINS), this proof of principle study aims to quantify the extent of structural damage of a peripheral nerve at the anatomical level of individual fascicles. Methods: In this institutional review board approved prospective study 13 patients with spontaneous AINS were examined at 3 Tesla including a transversal T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo and a spin-echo echo-planar-imaging pulse sequence of the upper arm level. Calculations of quantitative DTI parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) for median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles as well as ulnar and radial nerve were obtained. DTI values were compared to each other and to a previously published dataset of 58 healthy controls using one-way Analysis of Variance with Bonferroni correction and p-values <.05 were considered significant. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to assess diagnostic accuracy. Results: FA of median nerve lesion fascicles was decreased compared to median nerve non-lesion fascicles, ulnar nerve and radial nerve while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p <.001 for all parameters). Compared to median nerve values of healthy controls, lesion fascicles showed a significant decrease in FA while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p <.001 for all parameters). FA of median nerve non-lesion fascicles showed a weak significant decrease compared to healthy controls (p <.01) while there was no difference in MD, RD, and AD. ROC analyses revealed an excellent diagnostic accuracy of FA, MD and RD in the discrimination of median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles in AINS patients as well as in the discrimination of lesion fascicles and normative median nerve values of healthy controls. Conclusion: By applying this functional MR Neurography technique in patients with AINS, this proof of principle study demonstrates that diffusion tensor imaging is feasible to quantify structural nerve injury at the anatomical level of individual fascicles. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Although computed tomography (CT) and MR imaging alone have been used extensively to evaluate various musculoskeletal disorders, hybrid imaging modalities of PET-CT and PET–MR imaging were recently developed, combining the advantages of each method: molecular information from PET and anatomical information from CT or MR imaging. Furthermore, different radiotracers can be used in PET to uncover different disease mechanisms. In this article, potential applications of PET-CT and PET–MR imaging for benign musculoskeletal disorders are organized by benign cell proliferation/dysplasia, diabetic foot complications, joint prostheses, degeneration, inflammation, and trauma, metabolic bone disorders, and pain (acute and chronic) and peripheral nerve imaging. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: MR neurography is known to be useful to evaluate nerve pathology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with nerve-sheath signal increased with inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of relaxation enhancement imaging (SHINKEI) to distinguish patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) from healthy subjects. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 13 patients with CIDP and five healthy subjects from 2015 to 2017. The T2 relaxation time and the size of the cervical ganglia and roots of the brachial plexus were measured. Statistical analyses were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Results: The T2 relaxation times of the ganglia and roots were longer in patients with CIDP (119.31 ± 35.53 msec and 111.15 ± 33.82 msec) than in healthy subjects (101.42 ± 26.42 msec and 85.29 ± 13.22 msec, P = 0.0007 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The sizes of the ganglia and the roots were larger in patients with CIDP (6.25 ± 1.56 mm and 4.37 ± 1.71 mm) than in healthy subjects (5.59 ± 1.08 mm and 3.50 ± 0.62 mm, P = 0.0114 and P = 0.0014, respectively). ROC analysis revealed that T2 relaxation time of the roots was best at distinguishing CIDP patients from healthy subjects (the area under the curve = 0.748). Conclusion: Patients with CIDP could be distinguished from healthy subjects using simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with SHINKEI. © 2018

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), an autosomal dominant cerebellar disorder belonging to the polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, is characterized by progressive ataxia, slow saccadic eye movement, hyporeflexia, peripheral neuropathy, and pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. 1 The cause of SCA2 is a CAG repeat expansion, sometimes interrupted by CAA within, in ATXN2 on chromosome 12q24. 2,3 Previous reports have shown that the presence of 33 or more heterozygous trinucleotide repeats is pathogenic, whereas 14 to 31 repeats is normal. 3,4 We report a case of late-onset SCA2 with homozygous alleles of 31 trinucleotide repeats in ATXN2. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: We compared different surgical techniques for nerve regeneration in a rabbit sciatic nerve gap model using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), electrophysiology, limb function, and histology. Methods: A total of 24 male New Zealand white rabbits were randomized into three groups: autograft (n = 8), hollow conduit (n = 8), and collagen-filled conduit (n = 8). A 10-mm segment of the rabbit proximal sciatic nerve was cut, and autograft or collagen conduit was used to bridge the gap. DTI on a 3-T system was performed preoperatively and 13 weeks after surgery using the contralateral, nonoperated nerve as a control. Results: Overall, autograft performed better compared with both conduit groups. Differences in axonal diameter were significant (autograft > hollow conduit > collagen-filled conduit) at 13 weeks (autograft vs. hollow conduit, p = 0.001, and hollow conduit vs. collagen-filled conduit, p < 0.001). Significant group differences were found for axial diffusivity but not for any of the other DTI metrics (autograft > hollow conduit > collagen-filled conduit) (autograft vs. hollow conduit, p = 0.001 and hollow conduit vs. collagen-filled conduit, p = 0.021). As compared with hollow conduit (autograft > collagen-filled conduit > hollow conduit), collagen-filled conduit animals demonstrated a nonsignificant increased maximum tetanic force. Conclusions: Autograft-treated rabbits demonstrated improved sciatic nerve regeneration compared with collagen-filled and hollow conduits as assessed by histologic, functional, and DTI parameters at 13 weeks. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Despite the importance of pelvic floor muscles, significant controversy still exists about the true structural details of these muscles. We provide an objective analysis of the architecture and orientation of the superficial muscles of the perineum using a novel approach. Magnetic Resonance Diffusion Tensor Images (MR-DTI) were acquired in 10 healthy asymptomatic nulliparous women, and 4 healthy males. Global tractography was then used to generate the architecture of the muscles. Micro-CT imaging of a male cadaver was performed for validation of the fiber tracking results. Results show that muscles fibers of the external anal sphincter, from the right and left side, cross midline in the region of the perineal body to continue as transverse perinea and bulbospongiosus muscles of the opposite side. The morphology of the external anal sphincter resembles that of the number ‘8’ or a “purse string”. The crossing of muscle fascicles in the perineal body was supported by micro-CT imaging in the male subject. The superficial muscles of the perineum, and external anal sphincter are frequently damaged during child birth related injuries to the pelvic floor; we propose the use of MR-DTI based global tractography as a non-invasive imaging technique to assess damage to these muscles. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: In this study, we report a case of Finnish gelsolin amyloidosis (FGA) in a Chinese family. Methods: The proband presented with a range of clinical symptoms that included epileptic seizures and multiple lesions in the brain. Whole exome sequencing of the Gelsolin (GSN) gene was performed, and the GSN mutation was identified through comparison with the known human genome sequences using Genetic Testing Intelligent Execution System. Results: The GSN gene sequencing revealed that a heterozygous G duplicate in exon1 (c.100dupG) of the GSN gene, which caused a frameshift in GSN transcript translation in the proband, his mother and daughter, but his brother did not have it. Conclusion: We presented a new autosomal dominant heterozygous G duplicate mutation in exon1 of GSN gene, leading to FGA in a Chinese family. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to describe the development of morphologic and diffusion tensor imaging sequences of peripheral nerves at 7 T, using carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as a model system of focal nerve injury. Materials and Methods Morphologic images were acquired at 7 T using a balanced steady-state free precession sequence. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed using single-shot echo-planar imaging and readout-segmented echo-planar imaging sequences. Different acquisition and postprocessing methods were compared to describe the optimal analysis pipeline. Magnetic resonance imaging parameters including cross-sectional areas, signal intensity, fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as mean, axial, and radial diffusivity were compared between patients with CTS (n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 6) using analyses of covariance corrected for age (significance set at P < 0.05). Pearson correlations with Bonferroni correction were used to determine association of magnetic resonance imaging parameters with clinical measures (significance set at P < 0.01). Results The 7 T acquisitions with high in-plane resolution (0.2 × 0.2mm) afforded detailed morphologic resolution of peripheral nerve fascicles. For diffusion tensor imaging, single-shot echo-planar imaging was more efficient than readout-segmented echo-planar imaging in terms of signal-to-noise ratio per unit scan time. Distortion artifacts were pronounced, but could be corrected during postprocessing. Registration of FA maps to the morphologic images was successful. The developed imaging and analysis pipeline identified lower median nerve FA (pisiform bone, 0.37 [SD 0.10]) and higher radial diffusivity (1.08 [0.20]) in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (0.53 [0.06] and 0.78 [0.11], respectively, P < 0.047). Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity strongly correlated with patients' symptoms (r = -0.866 and 0.866, respectively, P = 0.005). Conclusions Our data demonstrate the feasibility of morphologic and diffusion peripheral nerve imaging at 7 T. Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity were found to be correlates of symptom severity. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - DDX41 has recently been identified as a new autosomal dominantly inherited cancer predisposition syndrome causing increased risk of adult onset acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We report for the first time compound heterozygote germline missense DDX41 mutations located in the DEAD-box domain, identified in two siblings by exome sequencing. Both siblings have slight dysmorphic findings, psychomotor delays and intellectual disability, and one developed blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) at age five. RNA-sequencing of bone marrow showed DDX41 expression including both mutations. However, the allele fraction of p.Pro321Leu accounted for 96% in the RNA-sequencing indicating this mutation to be the more significant variant. Exome sequencing of the leukemic blasts identified no additional known driver mutations. There is no pattern indicating autosomal dominantly inherited cancer predisposition in the family, but the father has sarcoidosis, which has been associated with heterozygous DDX41 mutation. We propose that bi-allelic mutations in DDX41 could potentially be a new cancer predisposition syndrome associated with delayed psychomotor development. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on 3D fat-suppressed techniques provide high accuracy for evaluation of brachial plexus and peripheral nerve lesions from a qualitative point of view. However, this qualitative evaluation often demonstrates overlapping features among different pathologies (Pullman et al., 2013). Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are functional MRI techniques that have been successfully applied in the imaging of central nervous system lesions, and now are being imported, with promising results for peripheral nerve and plexus evaluation. Several derived parameters from DWI and DTI studies such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or fractional anisotropy (FA), can be used as potential biomarkers of neural damage by providing information about axonal flow, fiber organization or myelin integrity (Andreou et al., 2015). In this study we assess the role of DW and DT based quantitative measures in characterization of traumatic and non traumatic lesions of brachial plexus and peripheral nerve and its influence on therapeutic management and outcome. Methods: 34 patients with features of brachial plexopathy and peripheral neuropathy were included in the study. MR neurography examinations included conventional MR sequences and unidirectional DW-MRN with background suppression (DWIBS) and DTI. The images were independently reviewed by two radiologists and the findings were recorded at different levels of the brachial plexus: ganglia, roots, trunks, divisions and cords. Mean ADC and FA values were determined within each lesion and within contra lateral homologous unaffected segment of the plexus. The Mann-Whitney Test was used to calculate the differences in ADC&FA values between diseased and normal sides and the One way ANOVA test between diseased segments of different pathologies with p-values <0.05 being considered statistically significant. Results: patients were classified according to etiologic causes into four categories: traumatic, compressive degenerative disk, radiation induced plexitis and neoplastic nerve compression or invasion. T2 high signal intensity and swelling of the affected nerve, muscular denervation and complication such as pseudo meningeocele and neuroma were the major findings in qualitatitve sequences. A statistically significant difference in ADC and FA values were found between diseased and normal sides as well as across the traumatic and non traumatic groups and between benign compressive and malignant infiltrative etiologies. Conclusion: The resulted values of newly designed quantitative protocols give us functional and numerical marker by which the diagnosis and differentiation of different pathologies of peripheral nerves and brachial plexus will be more suitable. © 2018

AB  - Peripheral nerve injuries result in severe loss of sensory and motor functions in the afflicted limb. There is a lack of standardised models to non-invasively study degeneration, regeneration, and normalisation of neuronal microstructure in peripheral nerves. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive evaluation of peripheral nerve injuries, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and tractography on a rat model of sciatic nerve injury. 10 female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to sciatic nerve neurotmesis and studied using a 9.4 T magnet, by performing DTI and DKI of the sciatic nerve before and 4 weeks after injury. The distal nerve stump showed a decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis (MK), axonal water fraction (AWF), and radial and axonal kurtosis (RK, AK) after injury. The proximal stump showed a significant decrease in axial diffusivity (AD) and increase of MK and AK as compared with the uninjured nerve. Both mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) increased in the distal stump after injury. Tractography visualised the sciatic nerve and the site of injury, as well as local variations of the diffusion parameters following injury. In summary, the described method detects changes both proximal and distal to the nerve injury. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The advent of detailed computational anatomical models has opened new avenues for computational life sciences (CLS). To date, static models representing the anatomical environment have been used in many applications but are insufficient when the dynamics of the body prevents separation of anatomical geometrical variability from physics and physiology. Obvious examples include the assessment of thermal risks in magnetic resonance imaging and planning for radiofrequency and acoustic cancer treatment, where posture and physiology-related changes in shape (e.g., breathing) or tissue behavior (e.g., thermoregulation) affect the impact. Advanced functionalized anatomical models can overcome these limitations and dramatically broaden the applicability of CLS in basic research, the development of novel devices/therapies, and the assessment of their safety and efficacy. Various forms of functionalization are discussed in this paper: (i) shape parametrization (e.g., heartbeat, population variability), (ii) physical property distributions (e.g., image-based inhomogeneity), (iii) physiological dynamics (e.g., tissue and organ behavior), and (iv) integration of simulation/measurement data (e.g., exposure conditions, “validation evidence” supporting model tuning and validation). Although current model functionalization may only represent a small part of the physiology, it already facilitates the next level of realism by (i) driving consistency among anatomy and different functionalization layers and highlighting dependencies, (ii) enabling third-party use of validated functionalization layers as established simulation tools, and (iii) therefore facilitating their application as building blocks in network or multi-scale computational models. Integration in functionalized anatomical models thus leverages and potentiates the value of sub-models and simulation/measurement data toward ever-increasing simulation realism. In our o2S2PARC platform, we propose to expand the concept of functionalized anatomical models to establish an integration and sharing service for heterogeneous computational models, ranging from the molecular to the organ level. The objective of o2S2PARC is to integrate all models developed within the National Institutes of Health SPARC initiative in a unified anatomical and computational environment, to study the role of the peripheral nervous system in controlling organ physiology. The functionalization concept, as outlined for the o2S2PARC platform, could form the basis for many other application areas of CLS. The relationship to other ongoing initiatives, such as the Physiome Project, is also presented. Copyright © 2018 Neufeld, Lloyd, Schneider, Kainz and Kuster.

AB  - Botulinum neurotoxin A (BTX-A) intervention has long-term benefits for children with obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP). Although cortical plasticity has been widely studied, plasticity in white matter has not received as much attention. Here, six children with OBPP underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before and 6 months after BTX-A treatment. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded. The aim was to investigate changes in the corticospinal tract (CST) as an example longitudinal observation of white matter plasticity. Deterministic fiber tracking with a Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking algorithm was used to reconstruct the CST. Fiber tracts passing through a region of interest (ROI) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and a target ROI in the upper-limb representation of M1 (defined by task-related fMRI) were selected as the CST. Motor performances were improved while EMG showed no significant difference 6 months after the treatment. We observed a significant increase in mean fractional anisotropy and a significant decrease in fiber number after treatment. We analyzed the correlations between DTI metrics and clinical motor assessments. Although the correlation results were not statistically significant, they support the notion that BTX-A treatment causes white matter plasticity and has a positive long-term outcome. Peripheral deafferentation may lead to altered information flow, resulting in the positive adaptation of white matter. This study provides novel insight into cerebral plasticity following peripheral nerve regeneration and indicates that a combination of relatively non-invasive therapies can accelerate plasticity of sensorimotor circuits and promote functional recovery in OBPP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - MRI relaxometry is sensitive to a variety of tissue characteristics in a complex manner, which makes it both attractive and challenging for characterizing tissue. This article reviews the most common water proton relaxometry measures, T1, T2, and T2 *, and reports on their development and current potential to probe the composition and microstructure of brain tissue. The development of these relaxometry measures is challenged by the need for suitably accurate tissue models, as well as robust acquisition and analysis methodologies. MRI relaxometry has been established as a tool for characterizing neural tissue, particular with respect to myelination, and the potential for further development exists. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study aims to find accurate angles and depths of lateral ventricle puncture using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reconstruction, as well as to provide an optimized and alternative puncturing strategy. A total of 90 computed tomography (CT) images and 30 CT images with DTI were analyzed. The measurements were performed on coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes. Some distances and angles were measured to determine the best angle and penetration depth during the puncture process. Important landmarks of the lateral ventricle were also measured, and a comparison of the differences between 2 hemispheres was also assessed. It showed that the vertical distance from the superior margin to inferior margin of the lateral ventricle was 22.2±0.5mm and the length was 124.1±2.1mm. In the frontal horn puncture approach, the penetration depth should be limited between 105.2 and 109.4 mm, the angle should be 71.6±2.7°. During the occipital horn puncture approach, puncturing depth was from 90.7 to 111.4mm, and angle was 15.3±1.8°. Through the parietal lobe puncture approach, which was firstly brought out in this study, the puncturing length should be 124.4 to 130.2mm and angle was 56.6±2.0°. The traditional recommended protocol of lateral ventricle puncture is not accurate, the refined lateral ventricle puncture protocol established in this study will reduce injury and remain function. A DTI imaging examination combining with nerve fibers reconstruction were strongly recommended before lateral ventricle puncture, which will help neurosurgeons to determine the best puncturing angles and depth. © 2018 the Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: To examine dorsal root ganglia and the proximal nerve segments in female patients with Fabry disease by functional and morphometric magnetic resonance neurography. Methods: In this prospective multicenter study the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and proximal sciatic nerve were examined in ten female patients with Fabry disease by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3 T. Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3–S2, permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1 and the spinal nerve L5 as well as the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic nerve were compared to 16 gender-matched healthy controls. Results: Dorsal root ganglia were symmetrically enlarged by 54% (L3), 79% (L4), 60% (L5), 94% (S1), and 106% (S2) (p < 0.001). Additionally, permeability of the blood–tissue interface was decreased by 47% (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the peripheral zone of the dorsal root ganglia, where the cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons are located (p < 0.001). While spinal nerve permeability showed no differences compared to healthy controls, proximal sciatic nerve cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6% (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Although heterozygous, Fabry females show severe enlarged dorsal root ganglia with a concomitant dysfunctional perfusion, even in patients with minor disease progression and in patients who are not considered for enzyme replacement therapy yet. Alterations in dorsal root ganglia volume and perfusion might serve as a very early in vivo marker for involvement of the peripheral nervous system in Fabry disease, even in patients with residual enzyme activity. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Repetitive electrical activity produces microstructural alteration in myelinated axons, which may afford the opportunity to noninvasively monitor function of myelinated fibers in peripheral nervous system (PNS)/CNS pathways. Microstructural changes were assessed via two different magnetic-resonance-based approaches: diffusion fMRI and dynamic T2 spectroscopy in the ex vivo perfused bullfrog sciatic nerves. Using this robust, classical model as a platform for testing, we demonstrate that noninvasive diffusion fMRI, based on standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can clearly localize the sites of axonal conduction blockage as might be encountered in neurotrauma or other lesion types. It is also shown that the diffusion fMRI response is graded in proportion to the total number of electrical impulses carried through a given locus. Dynamic T2 spectroscopy of the perfused frog nerves point to an electrical-activity-induced redistribution of tissue water and myelin structural changes. Diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) reveals a reversible shift of tissue water into a restricted isotropic diffusion signal component. Submyelinic vacuoles are observed in electron-microscopy images of tissue fixed during electrical stimulation. A slowing of the compound action potential conduction velocity accompanies repetitive electrical activity. Correlations between electrophysiology and MRI parameters during and immediately after stimulation are presented. Potential mechanisms and interpretations of these results are discussed. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: To restore full function following nerve crush injuries is critical but challenging. In an attempt to develop a viable therapy, we evaluated the effect of rat adipose-derived stem cells (rASC) in 2 different settings of a sciatic crush injury model. Methods: In the first group, after 14 days of nerve crush injury, rASCs were injected distal to the lesion under ultrasound guidance. In the other group, alleviation of compression through clip removal (CR) was combined with epineural injection of rASCs. Gait analyses, MRI, gastrocnemius muscle weight ratio (MWR), and histomorphometry were performed for outcome analysis. Results: CR combined with rASC injection resulted in less muscle atrophy, as evidenced by MWR. These findings are further supported by better functional and anatomical outcomes. Discussion: Animals treated with CR and epineural stem cell injection showed enhanced anatomical and functional recovery. Muscle Nerve 58: 566–572, 2018. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The prevalence of diabetes mellitus and its chronic complications continue to increase alarmingly. Consequently, the massive expenditure on diabetic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) and its sequelae, will also likely rise. Up to 50% of patients with diabetes develop DSPN, and about 20% develop neuropathic pain (painful-DSPN). Painful-DSPN can cast a huge burden on sufferers’ lives with increased rates of unemployment, mental health disorders and physical co-morbidities. Unfortunately, due to limited understanding of the mechanisms leading to painful-DSPN, current treatments remain inadequate. Recent studies examining the pathophysiology of painful-DSPN have identified maladaptive alterations at the level of both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Additionally, genetic studies have suggested that patients with variants of voltage gated sodium channels may be more at risk of developing neuropathic pain in the presence of a disease trigger such as diabetes. We review the recent advances in genetics, skin biopsy immunohistochemistry and neuro-imaging, which have the potential to further our understanding of the condition, and identify targets for new mechanism based therapies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been applied in the lumbar and sacral nerves in vivo, but information about the reproducibility of this method is needed before DTI can be used reliably in clinical practice across centers. Purpose: In this multicenter study the reproducibility of DTI of the lumbosacral nerves in healthy volunteers was investigated. Study Type: Prospective control series. Subjects: Twenty healthy subjects. Field Strength/Sequence: 3T MRI. 3D turbo spin echo, and 3.0 mm isotropic DTI scan. Assessment: The DTI scan was performed three times (twice in the same session, intrascan reproducibility, and once after an hour, interscan reproducibility). At site 2, 1 week later, the protocol was repeated (interweek reproducibility). Fiber tractography (FT) of the lumbar and sacral nerves (L3–S2) was performed to obtain values for fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity. Statistical Tests: Reproducibility was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and power calculations were performed. Results: FT was successful and reproducible in all datasets. ICCs for all diffusion parameters were high for intrascan (ranging from 0.70–0.85), intermediate for interscan (ranging from 0.61–0.73), and interweek reliability (ranging from 0.58–0.62). There were small but significant differences between the interweek diffusivity values (P < 0.0005). Depending on the effect size, nerve location, and parameter of interest, power calculations showed that sample sizes between 10 and 232 subjects are needed for cross-sectional studies. Data Conclusion: We found that DTI and FT of the lumbosacral nerves have intermediate to high reproducibility within and between scans. Based on these results, 10–58 subjects are needed to find a 10% change in parameters in cross-sectional studies of the lumbar and sacral nerves. The small significant differences of the interweek comparison suggest that results from longitudinal studies need to be interpreted carefully, since small differences may also be caused by factors other than disease progression or therapeutic effects.

AB  - Diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies relies on neurological examinations, electrodiagnostic studies, and since recently magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a fully-automatic segmentation method of peripheral nerves of the thigh. T2-weighted sequences without fat suppression acquired on a 3 T MR scanner were retrospectively analyzed in 10 healthy volunteers and 42 patients suffering from clinically and electrophysiologically diagnosed sciatic neuropathy. A fully-convolutional neural network was developed to segment the MRN images into peripheral nerve and background tissues. The performance of the method was compared to manual inter-rater segmentation variability. The proposed method yielded Dice coefficients of 0.859 ± 0.061 and 0.719 ± 0.128, Hausdorff distances of 13.9 ± 26.6 and 12.4 ± 12.1 mm, and volumetric similarities of 0.930 ± 0.054 and 0.897 ± 0.109, for the healthy volunteer and patient cohorts, respectively. The complete segmentation process requires less than one second, which is a significant decrease to manual segmentation with an average duration of 19 ± 8 min. Considering cross-sectional area or signal intensity of the segmented nerves, focal and extended lesions might be detected. Such analyses could be used as biomarker for lesion burden, or serve as volume of interest for further quantitative MRN techniques. We demonstrated that fully-automatic segmentation of healthy and neuropathic sciatic nerves can be performed from standard MRN images with good accuracy and in a clinically feasible time. © 2007-2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

AB  - Objective: Machado–Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is the most frequent spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide and characterized by brainstem, basal ganglia, and cerebellar damage. However, little is known about the natural history of the disease. This motivated us to determine the extension and progression of central nervous system involvement in SCA3/MJD using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based analyses in a large cohort of patients (n = 79) and presymptomatic subjects (n = 12). Methods: All subjects underwent MRI in a 3T device to assess gray and white matter. To evaluate the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, we used measures from FreeSurfer and SUIT. T1-multiatlas assessed deep gray matter. Diffusion tensor imaging multiatlas was used to investigate cerebral white matter (WM) and SpineSeg to assess the cervical spinal cord. Results: There was widespread WM and cerebellar damage, in contrast to the restricted motor cortex involvement when all patients are compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Presymtomatic patients showed WM microstructural abnormalities mainly in the cerebellar and cerebral peduncles and volumetric reduction of midbrain, spinal cord, and substantia nigra. To assess the disease progression, we divided patients into four subgroups defined by time from ataxia onset. There was a clear pattern of evolving structural compromise, starting in infratentorial structures and progressing up to the cerebral cortex. Conclusion: Structural damage in SCA3/MJD begins in the spinal cord, cerebellar peduncles, as well as substantia nigra and progresses to cerebral areas in the long term. These structural differences reveal some insights into the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD and suggest a staging scheme to map the progression of the disease.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare diffusion tensor imaging using the local look technique and sensitivity encoding for tractography of the periprostatic neurovascular bundle. We compared the surrounding tissues of the prostate in eight healthy volunteers. The results of tractography in terms of the numbers of fibers and the fractional anisotropy map were evaluated. Distortion was evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient between isotropic diffusion images created from diffusion tensor images and T2-weighted images. The number of lines in tractography was significantly greater in diffusion tensor imaging using the local look technique (p < 0.001). Although there was no difference in image distortion of the prostate between methods, an artifact appeared in the center of the diffusion tensor image using sensitivity encoding. In conclusion, diffusion tensor imaging using the local look technique was superior to that using sensitivity encoding for tractography of the periprostatic neurovascular bundle. © 2018, Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics.

AB  - Peripheral nerves are a composite tissue consisting of neurovascular elements packaged within a well-organized extracellular matrix. Their composition, size, and anatomy render nerves a challenging medical imaging target. In contrast to morphological MRI, which represents the predominant approach to nerve imaging, quantitative MRI sequences can provide information regarding tissue composition. Here, we applied standard clinical Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) and experimental three-dimensional (3D) ultrashort echo time (UTE) Cones sequences for quantitative nerve imaging including T 2 measurement with single-component analysis, T 2 * measurement with single-component and bi-component analyses, and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) analysis. We demonstrated the feasibility and the high quality of single-component T 2 *, bi-component T 2 *, and MTR approaches to analyze nerves imaged with clinically deployed 3D UTE Cones pulse sequences. For 24 single fascicles from eight nerves, we measured a mean single-component T 2 * of 22.6 ±8.9 ms, and a short T 2 * component (STC) with a mean T 2 * of 1.7 ±1.0 ms and a mean fraction of (6.74 ±4.31)% in bi-component analysis. For eight whole nerves, we measured a mean single-component T 2 * of 16.7 ±2.2 ms, and an STC with a mean T 2 * of 3.0 ±1.0 ms and a mean fraction of (15.56 ±7.07)% in bi-component analysis. For nine fascicles from three healthy nerves, we measured a mean MTR of (25.2 ±1.9)% for single fascicles and a mean MTR of (23.6 ±0.9)% for whole nerves. No statistically significant correlation was observed between any MRI parameter and routine histological outcomes, perhaps due to the small sample size and lack of apparent sample pathology. Overall, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of measuring quantitative MR outcomes ex vivo, which might reflect features of nerve structure and macromolecular content. These methods should be validated comprehensively on a larger and more diverse set of nerve samples, towards the interpretation of in vivo outcomes. These approaches have new and broad implications for the management of nerve disease, injury, and repair. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: We sought to characterize the clinical, neuropsychological, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging features of Parkinson’s disease (PD) after over 35 years since the onset of motor symptoms. Methods: Five consecutively consenting PD patients treated with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) were recruited in a cross-sectional study of motor (Unified PD Rating Scale section-III), non-motor (Non-Motor Symptoms Scale), autonomic (Scale for Outcome in PD-Autonomic), and neuropsychological features associated with the very advanced phase of PD. In addition, patients underwent neurophysiological (autonomic tests and nerve conduction studies) and neuroimaging (brain MRI, 123I-FP-CIT SPECT, and 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy) studies, as well as a genetic analysis of 34 genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with PD. Results: There was a sustained motor response to l-dopa (range 14.4–35.6%), STN-DBS (23.3–38.4%), and l-dopa plus STN-DBS (37.8–63.0%). There were mild-to-moderate non-motor symptoms (range 19–83 on a scale of 0 to 360) and autonomic dysfunction (8–28 on a scale of 0–69). Two patients were demented, one had mild cognitive impairment, and two were cognitively preserved. Three patients had a sensory-axonal peripheral neuropathy and two a moderate-to-severe autonomic neuropathy. All cases showed a complete nigro-striatal dopaminergic denervation and a severe cardiovascular noradrenergic denervation. The brain MRI revealed only moderate frontal atrophy. The genetic tests were unremarkable. Conclusions: Even after more than 35 years of disease, L-dopa and STN-DBS remain effective on PD cardinal symptoms. Although axial, autonomic, and neuropsychological features may become key determinants of disability, some patients maintain a satisfactory quality of life, without significant motor and non-motor impairment. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: The difference in clinical results between the direct anterior approach (DAA) and the anterolateral approach (ALA) for total hip arthroplasty (THA) is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare clinical results, including nerve injuries, between DAA and ALA in one-stage bilateral THA in a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Methods: Thirty patients were recruited for primary bilateral THAs from 2014 to 2016. The left and right hips of each patient were randomly assigned to DAA and the others to ALA. We prospectively compared the clinical results, incidence of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) injury, and tensor fascia lata (TFL) atrophy considered to be related to superior gluteal nerve injury between both approaches. Results: No significant difference was found in the clinical results between both sides at postoperative 1 year. Temporary symptom of LFCN injury was observed only in DAA sides (7/30, 23.3%). The ratio of 3-month postoperative to preoperative cross-sectional area of TFL on computed tomography was significantly lower on the side subjected to DAA (DAA side, 78.8 ± 22.8%) than on the side subjected to ALA (ALA side, 90.7 ± 17.7%) (p < 0.01). In magnetic resonance imaging at postoperative 1 year, the mean grade of fatty atrophy of TFL by Goutalier classification was significantly higher in DAA sides (2.00 ± 1.6) than in ALA sides (1.1 ± 1.3) (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Excellent clinical results for both DAA and ALA were achieved. LFCN injury was found only in DAA sides. Although TFL atrophy was found in both approaches, it was found significantly more in DAA sides. Our study suggested that ALA should be used rather than DAA in terms of the risk of nerve injuries. © 2018 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association

AB  - Neuropathic pain affects multiple brain functions, including motivational processing. However, little is known about the structural and functional brain changes involved in the transition from an acute to a chronic pain state. Here we combined behavioral phenotyping of pain thresholds with multimodal neuroimaging to longitudinally monitor changes in brain metabolism, structure and connectivity using the spared nerve injury (SNI) mouse model of chronic neuropathic pain. We investigated stimulus-evoked pain responses prior to SNI surgery, and one and twelve weeks following surgery. A progressive development and potentiation of stimulus-evoked pain responses (cold and mechanical allodynia) were detected during the course of pain chronification. Voxel-based morphometry demonstrated striking decreases in volume following pain induction in all brain sites assessed – an effect that reversed over time. Similarly, all global and local network changes that occurred following pain induction disappeared over time, with two notable exceptions: the nucleus accumbens, which played a more dominant role in the global network in a chronic pain state and the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which showed lower connectivity. These changes in connectivity were accompanied by enhanced glutamate levels in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex. We suggest that hippocampal hyperexcitability may contribute to alterations in synaptic plasticity within the nucleus accumbens, and to pain chronification. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - To detect, localize, and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in correlation with clinical and electrophysiologic findings. Methods We prospectively examined 20 patients with AL-polyneuropathy (PNP) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. After detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic testing, the patient group was subdivided into mild and moderate PNP. MRN in a 3.0 tesla scanner with anatomical coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to the tibiotalar joint was performed by using T2-weighted and dual-echo 2-dimensional sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3-dimensional, T2-weighted inversion recovery sequence. Besides evaluation of nerve T2-weighted signal, detailed quantification of nerve injury by morphometric (nerve caliber) and microstructural MRN markers (proton spin density, T2 relaxation time) was conducted. Results Nerve T2-weighted signal increase correlated with disease severity: moderate (420.2 ± 60.1) vs mild AL-PNP (307.2 ± 17.9; p = 0.0003) vs controls (207.0 ± 6.4; p < 0.0001). Proton spin density was also higher in moderate (tibial: 525.5 ± 53.0; peroneal: 553.6 ± 64.5; sural: 492.0 ± 56.6) and mild AL-PNP (tibial: 431.6 ± 22.0; peroneal: 457.6 ± 21.7; sural: 404.8 ± 25.2) vs controls (tibial: 310.5 ± 14.1; peroneal: 313.6 ± 11.6; sural: 261.7 ± 11.0; p < 0.0001 for all nerves). T2 relaxation time was elevated in moderate AL-PNP only (tibial: p = 0.0106; peroneal: p = 0.0070; sural: p = 0.0190). Tibial nerve caliber was higher in moderate (58.0 ± 8.8 mm 3) vs mild AL-PNP (46.5 ± 2.5 mm 3; p = 0.008) vs controls (39.1 ± 1.2 mm 3; p < 0.0001). Conclusions MRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve injury in AL-PNP in vivo with high sensitivity and in close correlation with the clinical stage. Quantitative parameters are feasible new imaging biomarkers for the detection of early AL-PNP and might help to monitor microstructural nerve tissue changes under treatment. © 2018 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - We generated a knockout mouse for the neuronal-specific β-tubulin isoform Tubb3 to investigate its role in nervous system formation and maintenance. Tubb3 −/− mice have no detectable neurobehavioral or neuropathological deficits, and upregulation of mRNA and protein of the remaining β-tubulin isotypes results in equivalent total β-tubulin levels in Tubb3 −/− and wild-type mice. Despite similar levels of total β-tubulin, adult dorsal root ganglia lacking TUBB3 have decreased growth cone microtubule dynamics and a decreased neurite outgrowth rate of 22% in vitro and in vivo. The effect of the 22% slower growth rate is exacerbated for sensory recovery, where fibers must reinnervate the full volume of the skin to recover touch function. Overall, these data reveal that, while TUBB3 is not required for formation of the nervous system, it has a specific role in the rate of peripheral axon regeneration that cannot be replaced by other β-tubulins. Latremoliere et al. show that the neuronal-specific tubulin isoform TUBB3 is not required for normal development and function of the nervous system. Lack of TUBB3 decreases the dynamics of microtubules in growth cones, and this reduces axonal growth after peripheral nerve injury and strongly delays functional recovery. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose of Review: This article addresses current clinical applications, recent literature, and potential future applications of 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI) for musculoskeletal (MSK) applications. Recent Findings: The main advantage of 3D MRI over standard 2-dimensional MRI is its ability to reduce partial volume averaging artifacts and create multiplanar reconstruction (MPRs) in any plane with any slice thickness from a single high-resolution isotropic acquisition. 3D MRI acquisitions are particularly useful for the evaluation of articular cartilage, which is prone to volume averaging artifacts, and for the assessment of longitudinally coursing structures such as peripheral nerves and tendons, which are better visualized with non-orthogonal MPRs. 3D MRI is also useful for surface and volumetric analysis of bone and cartilage for preoperative and longitudinal assessments. Current research is focused on decreasing acquisition times and automating segmentation through machine learning, thus overcoming some of the current limitations of 3D MRI and providing new applications for this technique. Summary: 3D MRI is widely used in MSK imaging today, and its use is likely to continue to increase in the future, with recent advancements focused on accelerated acquisition techniques and quantitative imaging. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The objective is to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in rhabdomyolysis in detail and determine their correlation with the development of peripheral neuropathy. Magnetic resonance images for 23 patients with confirmed rhabdomyolysis with (n = 11) or without (n = 12) peripheral neuropathy were retrospectively reviewed for the signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images, intramuscular hemorrhage, enhancement pattern, shape and margin in the longitudinal plane, edema in the deep fascia and overlying subcutaneous layer, multiplicity, and bilateral limb involvement. The collected data were statistically analyzed and the relationship between the imaging findings and the development of peripheral neuropathy was determined. Abnormal signal intensities on T1- or T2-weighted images were observed for all patients except one. Fourteen patients (60.9%) showed intramuscular hemorrhage. Stippled enhancement (11/23; 47.8%) was the most common enhancement pattern. Nineteen patients (86.4%) showed a well-defined rectangular shape with a ragged margin in the longitudinal plane. The affected muscle volume usually increased (17/23; 73.9%), with edema in the deep fascia and the overlying subcutaneous layer (13/23; 56.5%). Multiplicity within a muscle, compartment, and limb was observed in 7 (31.8%), 18 (81.8%), and 16 (72.7%) patients, respectively. Bilateral involvement was observed in 7 patients (30.4%). Only multiplicity within a compartment showed a statistically significant correlation with peripheral neuropathy development. Common MRI findings in rhabdomyolysis include intramuscular hemorrhage, stippled enhancement, a well-defined rectangular shape with a ragged margin in the longitudinal plane, and multiplicity. Multiplicity within a compartment may be a predictor of the development of peripheral neuropathy. Copyright © 2018 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To perform in vivo isotropic-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of lumbosacral and sciatic nerves with a phase-navigated diffusion-prepared (DP) 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) acquisition and modified reconstruction incorporating intershot phase-error correction and to investigate the improvement on image quality and diffusion quantification with the proposed phase correction. Methods: Phase-navigated DP 3D TSE included magnitude stabilizers to minimize motion and eddy-current effects on the signal magnitude. Phase navigation of motion-induced phase errors was introduced before readout in 3D TSE. DTI of lower back nerves was performed in vivo using 3D TSE and single-shot echo planar imaging (ss-EPI) in 13 subjects. Diffusion data were phase-corrected per kz plane with respect to T2-weighted data. The effects of motion-induced phase errors on DTI quantification was assessed for 3D TSE and compared with ss-EPI. Results: Non–phase-corrected 3D TSE resulted in artifacts in diffusion-weighted images and overestimated DTI parameters in the sciatic nerve (mean diffusivity [MD] = 2.06 ± 0.45). Phase correction of 3D TSE DTI data resulted in reductions in all DTI parameters (MD = 1.73 ± 0.26) of statistical significance (P ≤ 0.001) and in closer agreement with ss-EPI DTI parameters (MD = 1.62 ± 0.21). Conclusion: DP 3D TSE with phase correction allows distortion-free isotropic diffusion imaging of lower back nerves with robustness to motion-induced artifacts and DTI quantification errors.

AB  - Study Design. Prospective, cross-sectional observational study. Objective. We aimed to investigate the effects of chronic cervical radiculopathy (CR) on the cross-sectional area (CSA) values of the cervical nerve roots (CNRs), median, ulnar, and radial nerves with high-resolution ultrasonography. Summary of Background Data. Symptomatic nerve roots are wider than asymptomatic nerve roots due to the presence of edema. Peripheral nerves have also been shown to develop edema, fibrosis, and changes distal to the affected nerve as a result of mechanical compression. In addition according to "double-crush syndrome" hypothesis, the peripheral nerves are more sensitive to pressure, and a proximal nerve lesion makes the distal segment of the nerve more susceptible to anatomic deterioration by causing interruption in the axoplasmic conduction due to compression. Methods. Forty patients with chronic CR were included to the study. Both affected CNRs and the contralateral nerve roots (control group) were evaluated with high-resolution ultrasonography. Ulnar and median nerve CSA measurements were performed at four measurement points and radial nerve measurements at a single measurement point. Results. CSA measurements were statistically significantly higher at the CNR of the affected side compared to the unaffected side. There was no statistically significant difference when affected and unaffected sides were compared in terms of measurements performed from median, ulnar, and radial nerves at all measurement points. Conclusion. The results of the present study indicate that the changes in the CNR caused by CR do not have any effect on the peripheral nerves. We did not find any affection in peripheral nerve CSA that might have been suggestive of double-crush syndrome in CR. Level of Evidence: 2 . Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Background: The aim was to evaluate the regenerative effect of epineural injection of rat ASCs (rASCs) in three different settings of acute and chronic compression in a rat sciatic nerve model. Methods: Acute compression (60 s) with a vessel clamp over a distance of 1 mm (group 1) or 10 mm (group 2), as well as chronic compression with a permanent remaining, nonabsorbable polymeric clip over a distance of 1 mm (group 3) was performed. Depending on the group, either 5 × 10 6 rASCs or the same volume (25 μl) of culture medium (CM) was injected with a 30G needle in the epineurium at the time of compression. Outcome measures were functional gait evaluations, imaging analysis, histomorphometric analyses, and muscle weight. Results: The rats in group 2 had a better function than those with group 1 at one and especially at 2 weeks. After 4 weeks however, almost all rats were close to a normal function. There was a similar Muscle Weight Ratio (MWR) after 2 weeks in all groups, whereas after 4 weeks, the MWR in group 3 was lower compared with group 1 and 2. Histomorphometric analysis showed a better myelination in group 1 &amp; 2 compared to group 3 after 4 weeks. ASCs have a beneficial effect on myelin thickness (G-Ratio). Conclusions: We successfully evaluated the regenerative effect of epineural injection of rASCs in three different settings of acute and chronic compression. However, there were no significant differences in outcomes between the ASC-treated groups and control groups. © 2018 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background and Purpose Magnetization transfer contrast imaging provides indirect information on the concentration of "bound" water protons and their interactions with "free" water molecules. The purpose of this study is to analyze location- and age-dependent changes in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of lower extremity nerves. Materials and Methods Ten younger (20-32 years) and 5 older (50-63 years) healthy volunteers underwent magnetization transfer contrast imaging at 3 Tesla Two 3-dimensional gradient echo sequences with and without an off-resonance saturation pulse (repetition time: 58 milliseconds; echo time: 2.46 milliseconds; band width: 530 Hz/Px; flip angle: α = 7°) were acquired at 3 different locations covering the proximal thigh to the distal lower leg in the group of younger volunteers and at 2 different locations covering the proximal to distal thigh in the group of older volunteers. Sciatic and tibial nerve regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn and additional ROIs were placed in predetermined muscles. Magnetization transfer ratios were extracted from respective ROIs and calculated for each individual and location. Results In young volunteers, mean values of nerve and muscle MTR were not different between the proximal thigh (nerve: 20.34 ± 0.91; muscle: 31.71 ± 0.29), distal thigh (nerve: 19.90 ± 0.98; P = 0.76; muscle: 31.53 ± 0.69; P = 0.87), and lower leg (nerve: 20.82 ± 1.07; P = 0.73; muscle: 32.44 ± 1.11; P = 0.51). An age-dependent decrease of sciatic nerve MTR was observed in the group of older volunteers (16.95 ± 1.2) compared with the group of younger volunteers (20.12 ± 0.65; P = 0.019). Differences in muscle MTR were not significant between older (31.01 ± 0.49) and younger (31.62 ± 0.37; P = 0.20) volunteers. Conclusion The MTR of lower extremity nerves shows no proximal-to-distal gradient in young healthy volunteers but decreases with age. For future studies using MTR in peripheral nerve disorders, these findings suggest that referencing magnetization transfer contrast values in terms of age, but not anatomical nerve location is required. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Purpose of review: The purpose of this review is to discuss the therapeutic options available in the treatment of traumatic injuries involving peripheral nerves. Recent findings: For nerve gap repair, synthetic nerve tubes are limited to gaps below 3 cm in length and to small-diameter nerve repairs, whereas the dependency on proliferating host Schwann cell limits the size of acellularized autografts. Thus, in most situations, nerve autografts remain superior for nerve gap correction. Summary: When conservative treatment is either not indicated or ineffective, surgical intervention may be employed. The ideal timing of surgical intervention is often unclear and determined by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the injury, the timing of the symptoms, the type and severity of the injury, the completeness of the lesion, the required regenerative distance, the degree of fascicular disruption, and the degree of concomitant tissue trauma and contamination, as well as the morbidity and mortality of the procedure, and the age and comorbidities of the patient. The most common nonsurgical error is unnecessary surgical delay. To avoid losing the opportunity to achieve successful motor recovery, it is important to involve a peripheral nerve surgeon early. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article provides a review of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and how to get started. It explains step by step how to establish MRN at an institution: how to set up MRN protocols, how to train technicians, what a report needs to contain, and how relevant findings should be communicated to the referring physician. Advanced imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging are only briefly discussed at the end of the article because most of those techniques are difficult for beginners and are still not considered standard in the clinical routine. © 2018 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

AB  - Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and related techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are uniquely sensitive to the microstructure of the brain and spinal cord. In the acute aftermath of nervous system injury, for example, DWI reveals changes caused by injury that remains invisible on other MRI contrasts such as T2-weighted imaging. This ability has led to a demonstrated clinical utility in cerebral ischemia. However, despite strong promise in preclinical models and research settings, DWI has not been as readily adopted for other acute injuries such as traumatic spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the precise biophysical mechanisms that underlie DWI and DTI changes are not fully understood. In this report, we review the DWI and DTI changes that occur in acute neurological injury of cerebral ischemia, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and peripheral nerve injury. Their associations with the underlying biology are examined with an emphasis on the role of acute axon and dendrite beading. Lastly, emerging DWI techniques to overcome the limitations of DTI are discussed as these may offer the needed improvements to translate to clinical settings. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The goal of this review is to discuss the various imaging modalities to study neuropathic pain and its future implication in understanding pain network, for the diagnosis and management of patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is characterized by pain secondary to lesions or dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) or the peripheral nervous system. Neuropathic pain is generally chronic and disabling, and responds poorly to conventional treatment. Although our understanding of the imaging changes in chronic pain state is evolving, we still face practical challenges in implementing these finding to objectively diagnose and follow treatment response in patients with chronic pain and to guide targeted and individualized treatment to each chronic pain condition. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background: Conduit-based nerve repairs are commonly used for small nerve gaps, whereas primary repair may be performed if there is no tension on nerve endings. We hypothesize that a conduit-based nerve coaptation device will improve nerve repair outcomes by avoiding sutures at the nerve repair site and utilizing the advantages of a conduit-based repair. Methods: The left sciatic nerves of female Sprague-Dawley rats were transected and repaired using a novel conduit-based device. The conduit-based device group was compared to a control group of rats that underwent a standard end-to-end microsurgical repair of the sciatic nerve. Animals underwent behavioral assessments at weekly intervals post-operatively using the sciatic functional index (SFI) test. Animals were sacrificed at four weeks to obtain motor axon counts from immunohistochemistry. A sub-group of animals were sacrificed immediately post repair to obtain MRI images. Results: SFI scores were superior in rats which received conduit-based repairs compared to the control group. Motor axon counts distal to the injury in the device group at four weeks were statistically superior to the control group. MRI tractography was used to demonstrate repair of two nerves using the novel conduit device. Conclusions: A conduit-based nerve coaptation device avoids sutures at the nerve repair site and leads to improved outcomes in a rat model. Conduit-based nerve repair devices have the potential to standardize nerve repairs while improving outcomes. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: To determine the impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection on brain structure and functional organization of severely affected adult patients with neurological complications that extend beyond Guillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS)-like manifestations and include symptoms of the central nervous system (CNS). Methods: In this first case–control neuroimaging study, we obtained structural and functional magnetic resonance images in nine rare adult patients in the subacute phase, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. ZIKV patients showed atypical descending and rapidly progressing peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations, and importantly, additional CNS presentations such as perceptual deficits. Voxel-based morphometry was utilized to evaluate gray matter volume, and resting state functional connectivity and Network Based Statistics were applied to assess the functional organization of the brain. Results: Gray matter volume was decreased bilaterally in motor areas (supplementary motor cortex, specifically Frontal Eye Fields) and beyond (left inferior frontal sulcus). Additionally, gray matter volume increased in right middle frontal gyrus. Functional connectivity increased in a widespread network within and across temporal lobes. Interpretation: We provide preliminary evidence for a link between ZIKV neurological complications and changes in adult human brain structure and functional organization, comprising both motor-related regions potentially secondary to prolonged PNS weakness, and nonsomatomotor regions indicative of PNS-independent alternations. The latter included the temporal lobes, particularly vulnerable in a range of neurological conditions. While future studies into the ZIKV-related neuroinflammatory mechanisms in adults are urgently needed, this study indicates that ZIKV infection can lead to an impact on the brain. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic virus that becomes latent in the sensory ganglia, but later causes various neurologic complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, cranial neuropathy, and peripheral neuropathy [1]. While acute cerebellitis is one of the most frequent acute cerebellar diseases associated with VZV in childhood, VZV rarely causes cerebellitis in adults, with or without skin manifestations, and only a few isolated cases of adult VZV cerebellitis have been reported. We report a case of acute cerebellitis associated with VZV infection after a herpetic rash in an 80-year-old male. Functional imaging of his cerebellum showed high blood perfusion during the acute stage of the disease, though perfusion decreased in the subacute stage. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of peripheral nerves may provide additional information about nerve involvement in muscular disorders, but is considered difficult due to different optimal scan parameters tailored to magnetic resonance (MR) signal properties of muscle and neural tissues. Purpose: To assess the feasibility of sciatic nerve DTI using two different approaches of region of interest (ROI)-localization in DTI scans with b-values 500 s/mm2, in participants with muscular disorders and in controls. Material and Methods: DTI of the thigh was conducted on a 3T system in ten patients (6 men, 4 women; mean age =54 ± 15 years) with neuromuscular disorders and ten controls. T1-weighted (T1W) images were co-registered to fractional anisotropy (FA) color-encoded images. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, and fiber track length (FTL) were analyzed by two operators using a freehand ROI and a single-point ROI covering the sciatic nerve. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland–Altman analysis were used for evaluation of inter-operator and inter-technical agreement, respectively. Results: Three-dimensional visualization of sciatic nerve fiber was achievable using both techniques. The ICC of DTI metrics showed excellent inter-operator agreement both in patients and controls. Bland–Altman analysis revealed good agreement of both techniques. A maximum FTL was achieved using the single-point ROI technique, but with a lower inter-operator agreement (ICC = 0.99 vs. 0.83). The ADC and maximum FTL were significantly decreased in patients compared to controls. Conclusion: Both ROI localization techniques are feasible to analyze the sciatic nerve in the setting of muscular disease. A maximum FTL is reached using the single-point ROI, however, at the cost of lower inter-operator agreement. © 2017, © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2017.

AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders characterized primarily by a pyramidal syndrome with lower limb spasticity, which can manifest as pure HSP or associated with a number of neurological or non-neurological signs (i.e., complicated HSPs). The clinical variability of HSPs is associated with a wide genetic heterogeneity, with more than eighty causative genes known. Recently, next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed increasing genetic definition in such a heterogeneous group of disorders. We report on a 56- year-old man affected by sporadic complicated HSP consisting of a pyramidal syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataract, pes cavus, axonal sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy and cognitive decline. Brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy and thin corpus callosum. By NGS we found a novel homozygous biallelic c.452-1G > C mutation in the b-glucosidase 2 gene (GBA2), known to be causative for autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia type 46 (SPG46). The rarity of this inherited form besides reporting on a novel mutation, expands the genetic and clinical spectrum of SPG46 related HSP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: To identify demographic determinants of peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to establish normal values for fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD). Methods: Sixty subjects were examined at 3 Tesla by single-shot DTI. FA, AD, RD, and MD were collected for the sciatic, tibial, median, ulnar, and radial nerve and were correlated with demographic variables. Results: Mean FA of all nerves declined with increasing age (r = −0.77), which could be explained by RD increasing (r = 0.56) and AD declining (r = −0.40) with age. Moreover, FA was inversely associated with height (r = −0.28), weight (r = −0.38) and BMI (r = −0.35). Although FA tended to be lower in men than women (p = 0.052), this difference became completely negligible after adjustment to body weight. A multiple linear regression model for FA was calculated with age and weight as predictors (defined by backward variable selection), yielding an R2 = 0.71 and providing a correction formula to adjust FA for age and weight. Conclusion: Peripheral nerve DTI parameters depend on demographic variables. The most important determinants age and weight should be considered in all studies employing peripheral nerve DTI. Key points: • Peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters depend on demographic variables. • Fractional anisotropy (FA) declines with increasing age and weight. • Gender does not systematically affect peripheral nerve DTI. • The formula presented here allows adjustment of FA for demographic variables. © 2017, European Society of Radiology.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that measures the extent of restricted water diffusion and anisotropy in biological tissue. Although DTI has been widely applied in the brain, more recently researchers have used it to characterize nerve pathology in the setting of entrapment neuropathy, traumatic injury, and tumor. DTI artifacts are exacerbated when imaging off isocenter in the body. Anecdotally, the most significant artifacts in peripheral nerve DTI include magnetic field inhomogeneity, motion, incomplete fat suppression, aliasing, and distortion. High spatial resolution is also required to reliably evaluate smaller peripheral nerves. This article provides an overview of such technical issues, particularly when trying to apply DTI in the clinical setting, and offers potential solutions. Level of Evidence: 5.

AB  - The present study aims 1. to automatically classify the heterogeneously perfused tumors using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data from two patients diagnosed with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), 2. to compare the differences between the two cases, and 3. to detect the possible presence of hypoxia. A pattern recognition (PR) algorithm has been applied to the data resulting in the identification of areas with different perfusion. The algorithm was proven to be robust since the intensity curves of the PR classified pixels had similar shapes with the curves of the PR identified patterns and were in line with the theoretically expected enhancement patterns of the DCE time-signal curves. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose Given no definite consensus on the accepted autograft orientation during peripheral nerve injury repair, we compare outcomes between reverse and normally oriented autografts using an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique, diffusion tensor imaging. Methods Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: sham - left sciatic nerve isolation without injury, reverse autograft - 10-mm cut left sciatic nerve segment reoriented 180° and used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps, or normally oriented autograft - 10-mm cut nerve segment kept in its normal orientation for coaptation. Animals underwent sciatic functional index and foot fault behavior studies at 72 hours, and then weekly. At 6 weeks, axons proximal, within, and distal to the autograft were evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging and choline acetyltransferase motor staining for immunohistochemistry. Toluidine blue staining of 1-μm sections was used to assess axon count, density, and diameter. Bilateral gastrocnemius/soleus muscle weights were compared to obtain a net wet weight. Comparison of the groups was performed using Mann-Whiney U or Kruskal-Wallis H tests to determine significance. Results Diffusion tensor imaging findings including fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity were similar between reverse and normally oriented autografts. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography demonstrated proximodistal nerve regeneration in both autograft groups. Motor axon counts proximal, within, and distal to the autografts were similar. Likewise, axon count, density, and diameter were similar between the autograft groups. Muscle net weight at 6 weeks and behavioral outcomes (sciatic functional index and foot fault) at any tested time point were also similar between reverse and normally oriented autografts. Conclusions Diffusion tensor imaging may be a useful assessment tool for peripheral nerve regeneration. Reversing nerve autograft polarity did not demonstrate to have an influence on functional or regenerative outcomes. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Schwannomatosis and neurofibromatosis type 2 are hereditary tumor syndromes, and peripheral neuropathy has been reported in both. We prospectively applied in vivo morphometric measurement of dorsal root ganglia volume in 16 schwannomatosis patients, 14 neurofibromatosis type 2 patients, and 26 healthy controls by magnetic resonance neurography. Compared to healthy controls, dorsal root ganglia hypertrophy was a consistent finding in neurofibromatosis type 2 (L3, + 267%; L4, + 235%; L5, + 241%; S1, + 300%; S2, + 242%; Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.001) but not in schwannomatosis. Dorsal root ganglia may be a vulnerable site in origination of areflexia and sensory loss and a useful diagnostic marker in neurofibromatosis type 2.

AB  - Purpose To analyze the correlation between structural characteristics of intraorbital optic nerve (ION) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) measured by 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI), and the severity of glaucomatous damage. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 41 glaucoma patients and 12 age- and sex-matched controls underwent standard automated perimetry (SAP) and frequency doubling technology (FDT) as functional evaluation; optic disc stereophotograph, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal scanning laser tomography as ocular structural evaluation; and 3T MRI. Structure-structure and structure-function correlation were performed using bootstrap resampling method for clustered data. Results The ION mean diameter and cross-sectional area were different between glaucoma and control groups at 5mm and 10mm (all, p0.011) from the globe, but not at 15mm (both, p0.067). LGN height was significantly lower in glaucoma group (p = 0.005). OCT rim area and functional parameters (SAP and FDT) correlated significantly with all ION segments, showing stronger correlations at 10 and 15 mm. ION parameters at 10 and 15 mm presented mild-to-moderate correlation with OCT peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness, and ION at 15mm had mild association with the neuroretinal rim area on stereophotographs. Although LGN height was significantly smaller in glaucoma group (p = 0.005), LGN parameters were not associated with any ocular structural or functional parameter. Conclusion Assessment of central and peripheral nervous systems using 3T MRI confirmed that glaucoma patients had smaller ION dimensions and LGN height compared to the control group. In general, ION dimensions presented mild to moderate correlations with functional and ocular structural parameters. Although ION had significant correlations at any distance from the eye, the ION distal locations correlated better with OCT results and functional parameters. However, LGN parameters were not associated with functional or ocular structural parameters. © 2018 Furlanetto et al.

AB  - Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are non-specific and the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to their formation remain unclear. This study investigated brain perfusion in TBE patients using dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance perfusion imaging (DSC-MRI perfusion). Methods: MRI scans were performed for 12 patients in the acute phase, 3–5 days after the diagnosis of TBE. Conventional MRI and DSC-MRI perfusion studies were performed. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and time to peak (TTP) parametric maps were created. The bilateral frontal, parietal, and temporal subcortical regions and thalamus were selected as regions of interest. Perfusion parameters of TBE patients were compared to those of a control group. Results: There was a slight increase in CBF and CBV, with significant prolongation of TTP in subcortical areas in the study subjects, while MTT values were comparable to those of the control group. A significant increase in thalamic CBF (p < 0.001) and increased CBV (p < 0.05) were observed. Increased TTP and a slight reduction in MTT were also observed within this area. Conclusions: The DSC-MRI perfusion study showed that TBE patients had brain perfusion disturbances, expressed mainly in the thalami. These results suggest that DSC-MRI perfusion may provide important information regarding the areas affected in TBE patients. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this work is to examine the architectural configuration and the microstructural substrate of the cervical spine and its nerve roots with post-mortem (PM) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in non-fixed subjects and to compare these findings with histology. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner in five non-fixed non-trauma deaths. Two different areas were evaluated: 1) the cervical spinal cord and ventral and dorsal nerve roots with a “high in-plane” DTI and a multi-echo fast field echo protocol, and 2) the cervical peripheral nerves with an “isotropic” DTI and a 3D turbo spin echo protocol. Histology samples were obtained matching the anatomical level of the slices of the ‘high in-plane’ DTI protocol. Results: We were able to show detailed reconstructions of the dorsal and ventral nerve roots with the ‘high in-plane’ protocol and identified a low fractional anisotropy (FA = 0.30 ± 0.08) in the grey matter and a high FA (0.51 ± 0.13) in the white matter. Both grey and white matter configurations correlated with the anatomical MRI, the diffusion MRI, and with the histological sections. Using the ‘isotropic’ DTI protocol, it was feasible to reconstruct the spinal cord, cervical nerves, and nerve roots in all PM subjects. Conclusion: We were able to generate detailed architectural configurations of the ventral and dorsal nerve roots. Anatomical and diffusion MR scans showed good qualitative agreement with histology. We believe that PMDTI will be helpful in the assessment of head and neck injuries in a forensic setting. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Substance use disorders (SUDs) are marked by heterogeneity in clinical symptomatology and high relapse rates following treatment. Here, we describe specific peripheral and central stress responses associated with the pathophysiology of SUDs. We outline potential stress response measures, including hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis markers, autonomic responses, and central structural and functional brain alterations that could be exploited as putative biomarkers in SUDs. We posit that stress responses can be predictive of both the development of SUDs and their high relapsing nature. We examine their potential as candidate biomarkers, as well as the remaining challenges in developing and implementing their application for the prevention and treatment of SUDs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are complex, histologically benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that are challenging to measure by simple line measurements. Computer-aided volumetric segmentation of PN has become the recommended method to assess response in clinical trials directed at PN. Different methods for volumetric analysis of PN have been developed. The goal of this study is to test the level of agreement in volume measurements and in interval changes using two separate methods of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Methods: Three independent volume measurements were performed on 15 PN imaged at three time-points using 3DQI software at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) and MEDx software at NCI. Results: Median volume differences at each time-point comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were −0.5, −4.2, and −19.9 mL; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −21.0, −47.0, and −21.0 mL; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −10.0, −70.3, and −29.9 mL. Median differences in percentage change over time comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were −1.7, 1.1, and −1.0%; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −2.3, 3.3, and −1.1%; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −0.4, 2.0, and −1.5%. Volume differences were <20% of the mean of the two measurements in 117 of 135 comparisons (86.7%). Difference in interval change was <20% in 120 of the 135 comparisons (88.9%), while disease status classification was concordant in 115 of 135 comparisons (85.2%). Conclusions: The volumes, interval changes, and progression status classifications were in good agreement. The comparison of two volumetric analysis methods suggests no systematic differences in tumor assessment. A prospective comparison of the two methods is planned. © 2018

AB  - Abstract: Magnetic resonance neurography (also called MRN or MR neurography) refers to MR imaging dedicated to the peripheral nerves. It is a technique that enhances selective multiplanar visualisation of the peripheral nerve and pathology by encompassing a combination of two-dimensional, three-dimensional and diffusion imaging pulse sequences. Referring physicians who seek imaging techniques that can depict and diagnose peripheral nerve pathologies superior to conventional MR imaging are driving the demand for MRN. This article reviews the pathophysiology of peripheral nerves in common practice scenarios, technical considerations of MRN, current indications of MRN, normal and abnormal neuromuscular appearances, and imaging pitfalls. Finally, the emerging utility of diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging is discussed and future directions are highlighted. Key points: • Lesion relationship to neural architecture is more conspicuous on MRN than MRI. • 3D multiplanar imaging technique is essential for pre-surgical planning. • Nerve injuries can be classified on MRN using Sunderland’s classification. • DTI provides quantitative information and insight into intraneural integrity and pathophysiology. © 2017, European Society of Radiology.

AB  - Pure autonomic failure is an uncommon, idiopathic neurodegenerative disorder with primarily peripheral autonomic manifestations. The onset and progression of symptoms are gradual, and the presenting feature is characteristically orthostatic hypotension. Other commonly reported features of autonomic failure include constipation, bladder dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, and sweating abnormalities. The disorder is one of the alpha-synucleinopathies, a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by abnormal accumulation of the presynaptic protein, alpha-synuclein, in the central and/or peripheral nervous system. Although the initial presentation may be one of isolated peripheral autonomic impairment, over a period of time, some patients may develop motor and cognitive deficits that indicate central neuronal degeneration, and a phenotype consistent with one of the central alpha-synucleinopathies, Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and morphological analysis of peripheral nerve tumours (PNTs). In recent years, a number of novel MRI sequences such as MR neurography (MRN), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or MR tractography (MRT) have emerged extending the range of conventional MRI techniques. These advanced sequences are able to provide detailed information concerning PNTs structure, including the course and function of individual neural fascicles. This data can then be utilized in tailoring a suitable surgical procedure, reducing the risks of postoperative neurological deficit. The following case report of a median nerve tumour demonstrates the range and practicality of current MRI techniques. With continuing advancement and perfection of these MRI techniques, we can expect their integration into standard diagnostic protocols of PNTs. © 2018, Czech Medical Association J.E. Purkyne.

AB  - The most common methods for three-dimensional reconstruction of peripheral nerve fascicles include histological and radiology techniques. Histological techniques have many drawbacks including an enormous manual workload and poor image registration. Micro-magnetic resonance imaging (Micro-MRI), an emerging radiology technique, has been used to report results in the brain, liver and tumor tissues. However, micro-MRI usage for obtaining intraneural structures has not been reported. The aim of this study was to present a new imaging method for three-dimensional reconstruction of peripheral nerve fascicles by 1T micro-MRI. Freshly harvested sciatic nerve samples from an amputated limb were divided into four groups. Two different scanning conditions (Mannerist Solution/GD-DTPA contrast agent, distilled water) were selected, and both T1 and T2 phases programmed for each scanning condition. Three clinical surgeons evaluated the quality of the images via a standardized scale. Moreover, to analyze deformation of the two-dimensional image, the nerve diameter and total area of the micro-MRI images were compared after hematoxylin-eosin staining. The results show that rapid micro-MRI imaging method can be used for three-dimensional reconstruction of the fascicle structure. Nerve sample immersed in contrast agent (Mannerist Solution/GD-DTPA) and scanned in the T1 phase was the best. Moreover, the nerve sample was scanned freshly and can be recycled for other procedures. MRI images show better stability and smaller deformation compared with histological images. In conclusion, micro-MRI provides a feasible and rapid method for three-dimensional reconstruction of peripheral nerve fascicles, which can clearly show the internal structure of the peripheral nerve. © 2018 Medknow Publications.

AB  - Musculoskeletal (MSK) radiology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of MSK disorders and has rapidly expanded in tandem with advances in technology and improved access to imaging. Although anatomical imaging remains the mainstay of MSK radiology, significant progress has been made in functional and molecular imaging as well as in hybrid imaging with an expanding armament of technologies becoming available or in development. A vast array of research is occurring in MSK imaging, and this review article highlights some of the most promising current and future clinical applications in development in each of the major imaging modalities. Identifying the clinical utility of these technologies in an era of rising health care costs is an important challenge for MSK radiologists. © Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate optic nerve involvement in subacute combined degeneration (SACD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and visual evoked potential (VEP) studies, and their changes following cobalamine treatment. Methods: Six patients with SACD and six healthy matched controls were included. Visual acuity, field of vision, and color vision were tested. Pattern shift VEP was done, and P100 latency and amplitude were measured. Optic nerve MRI, and DTI of optic nerve to muscle ratio were measured, and fractional anisotropy ratio (FAR), axial diffusivity ratio (ADR), radial diffusivity ratio (RDR), and mean diffusivity ratio (MDR) were calculated. The patients received hydroxyl cobalamine 1000μg intramuscularly and their clinical examination, VEP and DTI studies were repeated at 3 months. results: The age of the patients ranged between 16 and 60 years and two were females. Their visual acuity, field of vision, and color vision were normal. P100 latency was prolonged in five patients (10 eyes) and amplitude was reduced in one (1 eye). The SACD patients had reduced FAR (1.94 ± 0.55 vs 2.81 ± 0.42; p = 0.01) and increased MDR (1.00 ± 0.04 vs 0.95 ± 0.01; p = 0.01) and RDR (0.96 ± 0.03 vs 0.89 ± 0.01; p = 0.002) compared to the controls. The FAR value correlated with P100 latency (r = -0.88). At 3 months, FAR value increased which was associated with improvement in P100 latency. conclusion: In SACD patients, optic nerve FAR is reduced and correlates with P100 latency. Both these parameters improve on cobalamine treatment. advances in knowledge: Subclinical VEP abnormalities are common in SACD but conventional MRI sequence of optic nerve is normal. DTI of optic nerve reveals reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) values which improve after cobalamine treatment. FA values correlate with prolongation of P100 latency. DTI and VEP abnormalities suggest subclinical optic nerve myelin dysfunction. © 2018 The Authors. Published by the British Institute of Radiology.

AB  - Background: We present a clinical, electrophysiological, sonographical and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) study examining the complementary role of two neuroimaging methods of the peripheral nervous system for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Furthermore, we explore the significance of cross-sectional area (CSA) increase through correlations with MRN markers of nerve integrity. Methods: A total of 108 nerve segments on the median, ulnar, radial, tibial and fibular nerve, as well as the lumbar and cervical plexus of 18 CIDP patients were examined with high-resonance nerve ultrasound (HRUS) and MRN additionally to the nerve conduction studies. Results: We observed a fair degree of correlation of the CSA values for all nerves/nerve segments between the two methods, with a low random error in Bland–Altman analysis (bias = HRUS-CSA − MRN-CSA, −0.61 to −3.26 mm). CSA in HRUS correlated with the nerve T2-weighted (nT2) signal increase as well as with diffusion tensor imaging parameters such as fractional anisotropy, a marker of microstructural integrity. HRUS-CSA of the interscalene brachial plexus correlated significantly with the MRN-CSA and nT2 signal of the L5 and S1 roots of the lumbar plexus. Conclusions: HRUS allows for reliable CSA imaging of all peripheral nerves and the cervical plexus, and CSA correlates with markers of nerve integrity. Imaging of proximal segments as well as the estimation of nerve integrity require MRN as a complementary method. © The Author(s), 2018.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in quantitatively monitoring chronic constriction injuri (CCI) of sciatic nerves and to analyse the association of DTI parameters with nerve histology and limb function. Methods: CCI was created on sciatic nerves in the right hind legs of 20 rabbits with the left as control. DTI parameters—fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD)—and limb function were longitudinally evaluated. Pathology analysis was performed on day 3 (d3), week 1 (w1), 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Results: FA of the constricted nerves decreased on d3 (0.316 ± 0.044) and increased from w1 to w10 (0.331 ± 0.018, 0.354 ± 0.044, 0.375 ± 0.015, 0.394 ± 0.020, 0.42 ± 0.03 and 0.464 ± 0.039). ADC increased on d3 until w2 (1.502 ± 0.126, 1.462 ± 0.058 and 1.473 ± 0.124 × 10−3 mm2 s−1) and decreased to normal from w4 to w10 (1.356 ± 0.129, 1.375 ± 0.107, 1.290 ± 0.064and 1.298 ± 0.026 × 10−3 mm2 s−1). AD decreased and stayed low from d3 to w10 (2.042 ± 0.160, 2.005 ± 0.095, 2.057 ± 0.124, 1.952 ± 0.213, 1.988 ± 0.180, 1.947 ± 0.106and 2.097 ± 0.114). RD increased on d3 (1.233 ± 0.152) and declined from w1 to w10 (1.19 ± 0.06, 1.181 ± 0.14, 1.071 ± 0.102, 1.068 ± 0.084, 0.961 ± 0.063and 0.923 ± 0.058). FA, ADC and RD correlated significantly with limb functional scores (all Ps &lt; 0.0001) and their changes were associated with histological changes. Conclusion: FA, ADC and RD are promising to monitor CCI. AD may be a stable indicator for injury. Histological changes, oedema, axon loss and demyelination, and fibrosis, accompanied the changes of these parameters. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) also known as Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease associated with severe clinical manifestations and premature death. Although rare, it is the most common autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide and has a distinct geographic distribution, reaching peak prevalence in certain regions of Brazil, Portugal and China. Due to its clinical heterogeneity, it was initially described as several different entities and as had many designations over the last decades. An accurate diagnosis become possible in 1994, after the identification of the MJD1 gene. Among its wide clinical spectrum, progressive cerebellar ataxia is normally present. Other symptoms include pyramidal syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, oculomotor abnormalities, extrapyramidal signs and sleep disorders. On the basis of the presence/absence of important extra-pyramidal signs, and the presence/absence of peripheral signs, five clinical types have been defined. Neuroimaging studies like MRI, DTI and MRS, can be useful as they can characterize structural and functional differences in specific subgroups of patients with MJD. There is no effective treatment for MJD. Symptomatic therapies are used to relieve some of the clinical symptoms and physiotherapy is also helpful in improving quality of live. Several clinical trials have been carried out using different molecules like sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, varenicline and lithium carbonate, but the results of these trials were negative or showed little benefit. Future studies sufficiently powered and adequately designed are warranted. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated that combining nerve conduits with neural stem cells or growth factors can repair peripheral nerve injury in rodents. However, nerve damage does occur with longer gaps in human than in rodents, thus findings from rodent studies are difficult to translate to clinical practice. Minipigs have a longer gap that is more closely applicable to the challenge of human nerve grafting in extensive traumatic nerve damage. In this study, human amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs) and polylactate nerve conduits were used to repair sciatic nerve injury in minipigs. The AFSCs exhibited the properties of mesenchymal stem cells with a propensity toward neural stem cells. Measurements of compound muscle action potential implied that administration of conduits with AFSCs was beneficial in function recovery in the minipig model compared with conduits alone. The results of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) based fiber tractography assay in the minipig model suggest that combining AFSCs with conduits could expedite the repair of sciatic nerve injury. Further, MR-based DTI provides an effective and non-invasive method to visualize the sciatic nerve and to monitor the regeneration progress of injured nerve in a longitudinal study. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1), a nuclear ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase with evidence suggestive of independent tumor suppressor function, predispose affected families to uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, malignant mesothelioma, and possibly a range of other tumors and malignancies as part of the BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome, a recently recognized hereditary cancer syndrome. Case Description A 50-year-old woman presented with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor of the left fifth metatarsal head. Further examination revealed a right renal mass and left breast mass. Her family history was significant for astrocytoma, melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Genetic testing revealed a BAP1 mutation in the proband. Conclusions Although there have been reports of sarcomas and meningiomas in patients affected with BAP1 mutations, to our knowledge malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in this patient population have not been previously reported. We report a case of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in a patient affected by a BAP1 mutation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: The immune system plays a pivotal role in nerve injury. The aim of this study was to determine the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluation of the synergic effect of immunomodulation on nerve regeneration in neurotmesis. Methods: Rats with sciatic nerve neurotmesis and surgical repair underwent serial multiparametric MR examinations over an 8-week period after subepineurial microinjection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequent subcutaneous injection of FK506 or subepineurial microinjection of LPS or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone. Results: Nerves treated with immunomodulation showed more prominent regeneration than those treated with LPS or PBS alone and more rapid restoration toward normal T2, fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial diffusivity (RD) values than nerves injected with LPS or PBS. Discussion: Nerves treated with immunomodulation exert synergic beneficial effects on nerve regeneration that can be predicted by T2 measurements and FA and RD values.

AB  - The role of neuroradiology in the diagnosis of neuropathologic conditions continues to grow with the advancement of modern technology. Cross-sectional imaging, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, has revolutionized the diagnostic approach to pathology of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Newer advanced imaging techniques, including functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and perfusion imaging, provide new valuable information that facilitates diagnosis and monitors response to therapy. Familiarity with neuroradiology imaging studies and basic neuroimaging patterns is therefore invaluable to the practicing neuropathologist, and the neuroradiologist and neuropathologist should work together to provide clinically useful information. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established imaging modality which is used in all districts of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems. More recently, initial studies have applied multiparametric MRI to evaluate quantitatively different aspects of musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve diseases, thus providing not only images but also numbers and clinical data. Besides 1H and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a relatively new MRI-based technique relying on principles of DWI, which has traditionally been used mainly for evaluating the central nervous system to track fibre course. In the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems, DTI has been mostly used in experimental settings, with still few indications in clinical practice. In this review, we describe the potential use of DTI to evaluate different musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve conditions, emphasising the translational aspects of this technique from the experimental to the clinical setting. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Background The management of peripheral nerve injuries remains a large challenge for plastic surgeons. With the inability to fuse axonal endings, results after microsurgical nerve repair have been inconsistent. Our current nerve repair strategies rely upon the slow and lengthy process of axonal regeneration (1 mm/d). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been investigated as a potential axonal fusion agent; however, the percentage of axonal fusion has been inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to identify a PEG delivery device to standardize outcomes after attempted axonal fusion with PEG. Materials and Methods We used a rat sciatic nerve injury model in which we completely transected and repaired the left sciatic nerve to evaluate the efficacy of PEG fusion over a span of 12 weeks. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of a delivery device's ability to optimize results after PEG fusion. Results We found that PEG rapidly (within minutes) restores axonal continuity as assessed by electrophysiology, fluorescent retrograde tracer, and diffusion tensor imaging. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that motor axon counts are significantly increased at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks postoperatively in PEG-treated animals. Furthermore, PEG restored behavioral functions up to 50% compared with animals that received the criterion standard epineurial repair (control animals). Conclusions The ability of PEG to rapidly restore nerve function after neurotmesis could have vast implications on the clinical management of traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Background Peripheral neuropathies refer to a group of disorders in which there is damage to the nerves of the peripheral nervous system. Electrophysiologic studies are the main stay for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies. However, direct visualization of the nerves is possible with exact localization of site of disease with high-resolution ultrasonography (USG) and 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, and newer magnetic resonance (MR) sequences. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study including 55 patients and 64 nerves with upper limb peripheral neuropathies. All patients included underwent high-resolution focused USG of the nerves and MR neurography. A nerve conduction velocity study was performed for reference. Results The diagnostic confidence of the turbo spin echo T2-weighted (T2W) MR sequence was seen to be highest, with a sensitivity of 95.31%, whereas it was 81.25% for USG. Continuity of the nerve in patients with traumatic neuropathy was seen in 65.7% and 62.86% (22/35) nerves on MRI and USG, respectively. T1-weighted and T2W MR sequences were seen to be equally effective in establishing the continuity of the nerve. Increase in the caliber/thickening was seen in 77% of cases on MRI and 73.8% of cases on USG. Neuroma formation was seen equally on both MR and USG in 60.66%. We consistently found low fractional anisotropy (FA) values at the site of disease. Conclusions USG is a sensitive technique to diagnose peripheral neuropathies and it should be used as a screening modality for focused MR to be performed later. Turbo spin echo T2W fast spin has the highest sensitivity to identify nerve disease and is comparable with nerve conduction studies. Among the newer sequences, diffusion tensor imaging should be performed to increase diagnostic confidence. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - During the last years high-resolution nerve sonography and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) comprising peripheral diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have emerged as promising biomarkers for peripheral nervous system (PNS) visualization. Several studies have thus far conducted to investigate disease-related PNS alterations in hereditary, immune-mediated and acquired axonal neuropathies as well as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We here review those findings to discuss their impact within the clinical setting. Overall, while MRN is still experimental in nature, nerve ultrasound can already aid in the diagnosis of various neuropathies. Electrophysiology and neuromuscular ultrasound have thus to be considered as ancillary techniques that should be used in a complementary manner in the same neurophysiological lab. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Introduction: Investigation of peripheral neuropathies by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) may provide increased diagnostic accuracy when performed in combination with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This study seeks to evaluate DTI in the detection of neuropathic abnormalities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A). Methods: MRI of the sciatic and tibial nerves, including MRN and DTI, was prospectively performed in 15 CMT1A patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs). The following MRI parameters were evaluated and correlated with clinical and neurophysiological findings: T2-relaxation time, proton spin density (PD) and DTI (fractional anisotropy [FA] and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]). Results: DTI showed lower FA and higher ADC in CMT1A compared with HCs. T2 relaxation time showed no difference; however, PD of the sciatic nerve was higher in CMT1A. There were some close associations between neuropathy severity and MRN-DTI, with the closest correlation between FA and nerve conduction velocity in the sciatic nerve (r = 0.76, P < 0.01). Discussion: MRN-DTI evaluation of sciatic and tibial nerves improves the detection of nerve abnormalities in patients with CMT1A. Muscle Nerve 56: E78–E84, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - purpose To explore the clinical application of ladder neoadjuvant therapy in low-grade advanced colorectal cancer. method The concept of stepped neoadjuvant therapy was proposed, and the efficacy of chemotherapy-effective surgery-ineffective radiotherapyeffective surgery mode was retrospectively analyzed in 80 patients with advanced rectal cancer who received step neoadjuvant therapy. result After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, complete remission (CR) occurred in 4 cases, partial remission (PR) in 43 cases, stable (SD) in 27 cases and progression (PD) in 6 cases. The response rate was 58.8%. The main side effects of chemotherapy were myelosuppression, digestive tract reaction, liver damage, peripheral neuritis and so on. After symptomatic treatment, the patients returned to normal and only 2 patients still had symptoms of peripheral nerve paralysis. There were 25 cases of Dixon operation and 22 cases of Miles operation. The anus retention rate was 53.2%. All cases had negative margins. Thirty-three patients with SD and PD continued to receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Among them, 7 were CR, 14 were PR, 8 were SD, and 4 were PD. The response rate was 63.6%. The operation method was Dixon in 8 cases and Miles in 13 cases. The anus retention rate was 38.1%, all of which had negative margins. Preventive stoma in 8 cases, presacral infection in 2 cases, radioactive injury in 6 cases, 30 cases of sexual dysfunction. In 12 cases, there was no chance of surgery after neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In 5 cases, the chemotherapyregimen was changed after simple stoma because of incomplete intestinal obstruction, and 7 cases were directly replaced with chemotherapy regimen. in conclusion Ladder neoadjuvant therapy can reduce R 0 resection rate and 2-year survival rate under the premise of reducing the radiation injury, improve patient compliance, reduce treatment costs, so that patients can be optimized treatment.

AB  - Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) refers to exercise-induced, reversible increases in pressure within well-defined inelastic fascial compartments leading to compromised tissue perfusion followed by functional loss, ischemic pain, and neurologic symptoms. Symptoms typically resolve when the activity ceases and there are usually no permanent sequelae. In the upper extremity, this condition most commonly affects athletes during sports requiring repetitive and vigorous gripping, such as rowers. In addition to clinical history and examination, a number of methods aid diagnosis, including compartment pressure measurements, magnetic resonance imaging, and near infrared spectroscopy. When symptoms persist despite conservative treatment, multiple operative techniques have been described to treat CECS including open, mini-open, and endoscopic release of involved compartments. We review the pathophysiology, diagnostic modalities, treatment strategies, and outcomes data for CECS of the upper extremity while highlighting areas of residual controversy. © 2017 American Society for Surgery of the Hand

AB  - Objective: To detect and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Methods: Thirty-six patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing–remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease-modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age-/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. Three Tesla MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2-dimensional (2D) fat-saturated, T2-weighted (T2w) and dual echo turbo spin echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton spin density and T2 relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion. Results: T2w hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients, with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5 ± 5.7 versus 19.1 ± 2.4 in controls (p &lt; 0.0001). Nerve proton spin density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8 ± 7.7/368.9 ± 8.2) versus controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0 ± 11.0/276.8 ± 9.7, p &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, T2 relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal: 82.0 ± 2.1/78.3 ± 1.7) versus MS (tibial/peroneal: 64.3 ± 1.0/61.2 ± 0.9, p &lt; 0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial: 52.4 ± 2.1mm2, peroneal: 25.4 ± 1.3mm2) versus controls (tibial: 45.2 ± 1.4mm2, p &lt; 0.0015; peroneal: 21.3 ± 0.7mm2, p = 0.0049). Interpretation: Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS in vivo by high-resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton spin density and a decrease of T2 relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS.

AB  - Purpose The aims of this study were to assess diagnostic accuracy of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), to correlate DTI with electrophysiological parameters, and to evaluate whether radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) might serve as specific biomarkers of demyelinating and axonal pathology. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Magnetic resonance neurography of upper and lower extremity nerves (median, ulnar, radial, sciatic, tibial) was performed by single-shot DTI sequences at 3.0 T in 18 patients with a diagnosis of CIDP and 18 healthy controls, matched to age and sex. The scalar readout parameters nerve fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), RD, and AD were obtained after manual segmentation and postprocessing and compared between patients and controls. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and cutoff values were calculated by maximizing the Youden index. All patients underwent a complementary electroneurography and correlation of electrophysiological markers and DTI parameters was analyzed and described by Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results: Nerve FA was decreased to a mean of 0.42 ± 0.08 in patients compared with 0.52 ± 0.04 in healthy controls (P < 0.001). This decrease in FA was a result of an increase of RD (P = 0.02), whereas AD did not differ between the two groups. Of all DTI parameters, FA showed best diagnostic accuracy with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.90. Optimal cutoff for an average FA of all analyzed nerves was 0.47, yielding a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity of 0.94. Fractional anisotropy and RD correlated strongly with electrophysiological markers of demyelination, whereas AD did not correlate with markers of axonal neuropathy. Conclusions: Diffusion tensor imaging yields valid quantitative biomarkers in CIDP and might aid in diagnosis with high diagnostic accuracy. Fractional anisotropy and RD may serve as parameters of myelin sheath integrity, but AD is unable to reflect axonal damage in CIDP. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Peripheral neuritis caused by acrylamide is well-known, and many Korean grouting workers are frequently exposed to acrylamide in grouting agents that are injected into cracked concrete. We recently encountered two cases of dermal and neural toxicity in Korean grouting workers with exposure to grouting agents that contained a high concentration of acrylamide. Case presentation: The first case involved a 44-year-old man with 8 years of waterproofing experience. The patient developed peeling skin on both hands while grouting, which progressed to systemic neurological symptoms, such as reduced sensory function and strength. The patient was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy caused by acrylamide exposure, and fully recovered after conservative treatment and withdrawal of exposure to the grouting agent. The second case involved a 34-year-old man with 10 years of grouting experience. The patient initially experienced weakness in both legs, which progressed to weakness in his arms and uncontrolled phonation. After being hospitalized, he was diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy caused by acrylamide exposure, and was discharged after conservative treatment. Our follow-up investigation revealed that both workers were recently exposed to grouting agents that contained higher concentrations of acrylamide, compared to the agents that they had previously been using. Conclusions: Both workers had workplace acrylamide exposure through dermal contact plus inhalation of dust and vapor, which led to the neural toxicity and dermatitis. Therefore, government studies are needed to investigate the current status of workplace acrylamide use, and to protect workers from the hazardous effects of using acrylamide-containing grouting agents. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Diet and activity are recognized as modulators of nervous system disease, including pain. Studies of exercise consistently reveal a benefit on pain. This study focused on female rats to understand differences related to metabolic status and peripheral nerve function in females. Methods: Here, we investigated parameters of peripheral nerve function relevant to pain in rats selectively bred for high (high-capacity runners; HCR) or low endurance exercise capacity (low-capacity runners; LCR) resulting in divergent intrinsic aerobic capacities and susceptibility for metabolic conditions. Results: LCR female rats have reduced mechanical sensitivity, higher intraepidermal nerve fiber density and TrkA-positive epidermal axons, increased numbers of Langerhans and mast cells in cutaneous tissues, and a higher fat content despite similar overall body weights compared to female HCR rats. Sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities, thermal sensitivity, and mRNA expression of selected genes relevant to peripheral sensation were not different. Conclusions: These results suggest that aerobic capacity and metabolic status influence sensory sensitivity and aspects of inflammation in peripheral tissues that could lead to poor responses to tissue damage and painful stimuli. The LCR and HCR rats should prove useful as models to assess how the metabolic status impacts pain. © 2017 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate functional and morphometric magnetic resonance neurography of the dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve segments in patients with Fabry painful neuropathy. Methods: In this prospective study, the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and proximal peripheral nerve segments of the lower extremity were examined in 11 male patients with Fabry disease by a standardized 3T magnetic resonance neurography protocol. Volumes of L3 to S2 dorsal root ganglia, perfusion parameters of L5-S1 dorsal root ganglia and the spinal nerve L5, and the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic nerve were compared to healthy controls. Results: Dorsal root ganglia of patients with Fabry disease were symmetrically enlarged by 78% (L3), 94% (L4), 122% (L5), 115% (S1), and 119% (S2) (p < 0.001). In addition, permeability of the blood-tissue interface was decreased by 53% (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the peripheral zone of the dorsal root ganglion containing the cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons (p < 0.001). Spinal nerve permeability showed no difference between patients with Fabry disease and controls (p = 0.7). The sciatic nerve of patients with Fabry disease at the thigh level showed an increase in cross-sectional area by 48% (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with Fabry disease have severely enlarged dorsal root ganglia with dysfunctional perfusion. This may be due to glycolipid accumulation in the dorsal root ganglia mediating direct neurotoxic effects and decreased neuronal blood supply. These alterations were less pronounced in peripheral nerve segments. Thus, the dorsal root ganglion might play a key pathophysiologic role in the development of neuropathy and pain in Fabry disease. © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension of the popular diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique. DKI takes into account leading deviations from Gaussian diffusion stemming from a number of effects related to the microarchitecture and compartmentalization in biological tissues. DKI therefore offers increased sensitivity to subtle microstructural alterations over conventional diffusion imaging such as DTI, as has been demonstrated in numerous reports. For this reason, interest in routine clinical application of DKI is growing rapidly. In an effort to facilitate more widespread use of DKI, recent work by our group has focused on developing experimentally fast and robust estimates of DKI metrics. A significant increase in speed is made possible by a reduction in data demand achieved through rigorous analysis of the relation between the DKI signal and the kurtosis tensor based metrics. The fast DKI methods therefore need only 13 or 19 images for DKI parameter estimation compared to more than 60 for the most modest DKI protocols applied today. Closed form solutions also ensure rapid calculation of most DKI metrics. Some parameters can even be reconstructed in real time, which may be valuable in the clinic. The fast techniques are based on conventional diffusion sequences and are therefore easily implemented on almost any clinical system, in contrast to a range of other recently proposed advanced diffusion techniques. In addition to its general applicability, this also ensures that any acceleration achieved in conventional DKI through sequence or hardware optimization will also translate directly to fast DKI acquisitions. In this review, we recapitulate the theoretical basis for the fast kurtosis techniques and their relation to conventional DKI. We then discuss the currently available variants of the fast kurtosis techniques, their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their respective realms of application. These range from whole body applications to methods mostly suited for spinal cord or peripheral nerve, and analysis specific to brain white matter. Having covered these technical aspects, we proceed to review the fast kurtosis literature including validation studies, organ specific optimization studies and results from clinical applications. © 2017 Hansen and Jespersen.

AB  - Accurate simulations of peripheral nerve recordings are needed to develop improved neuroprostheses. Previous models of peripheral nerves contained simplifications whose effects have not been investigated. We created a novel detailed finite element (FE) model of a peripheral nerve, and used it to carry out a sensitivity analysis of several model parameters. To construct the model, in vivo recordings were obtained in a rat sciatic nerve using an 8-channel nerve cuff electrode, after which the nerve was imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The FE model was constructed based on the MRI data, and included progressive branching of the fascicles. Neural pathways were defined in the model for the tibial, peroneal and sural fascicles. The locations of these pathways were selected so as to maximize the correlations between the simulated and in vivo recordings. The sensitivity analysis showed that varying the conductivities of neural tissues had little influence on the ability of the model to reproduce the recording patterns obtained experimentally. On the other hand, the increased anatomical detail did substantially alter the recording patterns observed, demonstrating that incorporating fascicular branching is an important consideration in models of nerve cuff recordings. The model used in this study constitutes an improved simulation tool and can be used in the design of neural interfaces. © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Mutations in the NEFH gene encoding the heavy neurofilament protein are usually associated with neuronal damage and susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recently, frameshift variants in NEFH (p.Asp1004Glnfs*58 and p.Pro1008Alafs*56) have been reported to be the underlying cause of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2CC (CMT2CC). The frameshift mutation resulted in a stop loss and translation of a cryptic amyloidogenic element (CAE) encoded by the 3′ untranslated region (UTR). This study also identified a de novo c.3015_3027dup frameshift mutation predicting p.Lys1010Glnfs*57 in NEFH from a CMT2 family with an atypical clinical symptom of prominent proximal weakness. This mutation is located near the previously reported frameshift mutations, suggesting a mutational hotspot. Lower limb magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed marked hyperintense signal changes in the thigh muscles compared with those in the calf muscles. Therefore, this study suggests that the stop loss and translational elongations by the 3′ UTR of the NEFH mutations may be a relatively frequent genetic cause of axonal peripheral neuropathy with the specific characteristics of proximal dominant weakness. © 2017 Peripheral Nerve Society

AB  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in the measurement of peripheral nerve integrity, although the optimal way to apply the technique for the study of lumbar spinal nerves is unclear. The aims of this study are to use an improved DTI acquisition to investigate lumbar nerve root integrity and correlate this with functional measures using neurophysiology. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers underwent 3 T DTI of the L5/S1 area. Regions of interest were applied to L5 and S1 nerve roots, and DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity) were derived. Neurophysiological measures were obtained from muscles innervated by L5/S1 nerves; these included the slope of motor-evoked potential input-output curves, F-wave latency, maximal motor response, and central and peripheral motor conduction times. Results: DTI metrics were similar between the left and right sides and between vertebral levels. Conversely, significant differences in DTI measures were seen along the course of the nerves. Regression analyses revealed that DTI metrics of the L5 nerve correlated with neurophysiological measures from the muscle innervated by it. Conclusion: The current findings suggest that DTI has the potential to be used for assessing lumbar spinal nerve integrity and that parameters derived from DTI provide quantitative information which reflects their function. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - From time to time it is thoughtful and productive to review a medical field and reflect upon what are the major issues that need to be addressed and what is being done to do so. This review article is not meant to be all-inclusive but rather focuses on four evolving areas in the field of peripheral nerve disorders and treatments: (1) nerve surgery under ultrasound guidance using a new ultra-minimally invasive thread technique; (2) evolving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging techniques that are helping to both diagnose and treat a variety of peripheral nerve problems including entrapment neuropathies, traumatic nerve injuries, and masses arising from nerves; (3) promoting recovery after nerve injury using electrical stimulation; and (4) developing animal models to reproduce a severe nerve injury (neurotmetic grade in continuity) that requires a surgical intervention and repair. In each area we first describe the current challenges and then discuss new and emerging techniques and approaches. It is our hope that this article will bring added attention and resources to help better address peripheral nerve problems that remain a challenge for both patients and physicians. © 2017 Springer-Verlag Wien

AB  - Traumatic conditions of peripheral nerves and plexus have been classically evaluated by morphological imaging techniques and electrophysiological tests. New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies based on 3D fat-suppressed techniques are providing high accuracy for peripheral nerve injury evaluation from a qualitative point of view. However, these techniques do not provide quantitative information. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are functional MRI techniques that are able to evaluate and quantify the movement of water molecules within different biological structures. These techniques have been successfully applied in other anatomical areas, especially in the assessment of central nervous system, and now are being imported, with promising results for peripheral nerve and plexus evaluation. DWI and DTI allow performing a qualitative and quantitative peripheral nerve analysis, providing valuable pathophysiological information about functional integrity of these structures. In the field of trauma and peripheral nerve or plexus injury, several derived parameters from DWI and DTI studies such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or fractional anisotropy (FA) among others, can be used as potential biomarkers of neural damage providing information about fiber organization, axonal flow or myelin integrity. A proper knowledge of physical basis of these techniques and their limitations is important for an optimal interpretation of the imaging findings and derived data. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the potential applications of DWI and DTI neurographic studies is performed with a focus on traumatic conditions, including main nerve entrapment syndromes in both peripheral nerves and brachial or lumbar plexus. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

AB  - Purpose To investigate in vivo morphological and functional correlates of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXA-PNP) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Methods Twenty patients (7 female, 13 male, 58.9±10.0 years) with mild to moderate OXA-PNP and 20 matched controls (8 female, 12 male, 55.7±15.6 years) were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent a detailed neurophysiological examination prior to neuroimaging. A standardized imaging protocol at 3.0 Tesla included the lumbosacral plexus and both sciatic nerves and their branches using T2-weighted fat-saturated sequences and diffusion tensor imaging. Quantitative assessment included volumetry of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), sciatic nerve normalized T2 (nT2) signal and caliber, and fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). Additional qualitative evaluation of sciatic, peroneal, and tibial nerves evaluated the presence, degree, and distribution of nerve lesions. Results DRG hypertrophy in OXA-PNP patients (207.3±47.7mm3 vs. 153.0±47.1mm3 in controls, p = 0.001) was found as significant morphological correlate of the sensory neuronopathy. In contrast, peripheral nerves only exhibited minor morphological alterations qualitatively. Quantitatively, sciatic nerve caliber (27.3±6.7mm2 vs. 27.4±7.4mm2, p = 0.80) and nT2 signal were not significantly changed in patients (1.32±0.22 vs. 1.22±0.26, p = 0.16). AD, RD, and MD showed a non-significant decrease in patients, while FA was unchanged. Conclusion OXA-PNP manifests with morphological and functional correlates that can be detected in vivo by MRN. We report hypertrophy of the DRG that stands in contrast to experimental and postmortem studies. DRG volume should be further investigated as a biomarker in other sensory peripheral neuropathies and ganglionopathies. © 2017 Apostolidis et al.

AB  - Objective: To detect and quantify lesions of the small-caliber sural nerve (SN) in symptomatic and asymptomatic transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in correlation with electrophysiologic and histopathologic findings. Methods: Twenty-five patients with TTR-FAP, 10 asymptomatic carriers of the mutated transthyretin gene (mutTTR), and 35 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were prospectively included in this cross-sectional case-control study. All participants underwent 3T MRN with high-structural resolution (fat-saturated, T2-weighted, and double-echo sequences). Total imaging time wasz45 minutes per patient. Manual SN segmentation was performed from its origin at the sciatic nerve bifurcation to the lower leg with subsequent evaluation of quantitative microstructural and morphometric parameters. Additional time needed for postprocessing was z1.5 hours per participant. Detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic examinations were conducted in the TTR group. Results: T2 signal and proton spin density (r) reliably differentiated between TTR-FAP (198.06 13.3, 429.6 6 15.25), mutTTR carriers (137.0 6 16.9, p 5 0.0009; 354.7 6 21.64, p 5 0.0029), and healthy controls (90.0 6 3.4, 258.2 6 9.10; p , 0.0001). Marked differences between mutTTR carriers and controls were found for T2 signal (p50.0065) and r (p,0.0001). T2 relaxation timewas higher in patients with TTR-FAP only (p 5 0.015 vs mutTTR carriers, p 5 0.0432 vs controls). SN caliber was higher in patients with TTR-FAP vs controls and in mutTTR carriers vs controls (p , 0.0001). Amyloid deposits were histopathologically detectable in 10 of 14 SN specimens. Conclusions: SN injury in TTR-FAP is detectable and quantifiable in vivo byMRNeven in asymptomatic mutTTR carriers. Differences in SN T2 signal between controls and asymptomaticmutTTR carriers are derived mainly from an increase of r, which overcomes typical limitations of established diagnostic methods as a highly sensitive imaging biomarker for early detection of peripheral nerve lesions. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that MRN accurately identifies asymptomatic mutTTR carriers. © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Background The precise annotation and accurate identification of the topography of fascicles to the end organs are prerequisites for studying human peripheral nerves. New method In this study, we present a feasible imaging method that acquires 3D high-resolution (HR) topography of peripheral nerve fascicles using an iodine and freeze-drying (IFD) micro-computed tomography (microCT) method to greatly increase the contrast of fascicle images. Results The enhanced microCT imaging method can facilitate the reconstruction of high-contrast HR fascicle images, fascicle segmentation and extraction, feature analysis, and the tracing of fascicle topography to end organs, which define fascicle functions. Comparison with existing methods The complex intraneural aggregation and distribution of fascicles is typically assessed using histological techniques or MR imaging to acquire coarse axial three-dimensional (3D) maps. However, the disadvantages of histological techniques (static, axial manual registration, and data instability) and MR imaging (low-resolution) limit these applications in reconstructing the topography of nerve fascicles. Conclusions Thus, enhanced microCT is a new technique for acquiring 3D intraneural topography of the human peripheral nerve fascicles both to improve our understanding of neurobiological principles and to guide accurate repair in the clinic. Additionally, 3D microstructure data can be used as a biofabrication model, which in turn can be used to fabricate scaffolds to repair long nerve gaps. © 2017

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of 3 T magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brachial plexus in healthy subjects. Methods Ten healthy volunteers were included, and morphological and DTI sequences of the nerve roots of the brachial plexus from C5 to T1 of both sides were repeatedly acquired on a 3 T magnetic resonance system (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). A prototype diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence-enabling slice-specific shim adjustments was performed with b-values of 0 and 800 s/mm2 in 30 gradient directions, resulting in an acquisition time of about 6 minutes each in axial orientation. Between scans, subjects were moved and repositioned in the scanner, coils were reinserted, and new localizers were acquired. Image analysis was performed using MITK Diffusion software toolkit. Two independent readers performed diffusion data postprocessing, and regions of interest (ROIs) were set on the proximal postganglionic trunk at each spinal level, bilaterally to obtain values for fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Interreader and intrareader agreement as well as test-retest reproducibility of DTI metrics were assessed. Results Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for interreader and intrareader agreement did not differ significantly between measurements for FA and MD. In particular, ICCs for interreader agreement of FA ranged from 0.741 to 0.961 and that of MD ranged from 0.802 to 0.998, and ICCs for intrareader agreement of FA ranged from 0.759 to 0.949 and that of MD ranged from 0.796 to 0.998. The test-retest reproducibility of DTI metrics showed an overall moderate to strong correlation (r &gt; 0.707), with few minor exceptions, for both FA and MD values. Conclusions Diffusion tensor imaging metrics in the brachial plexus are reproducible. Future applications of DTI for a possible clinical use should be further investigated. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and interobserver performance of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and detect correlations with electrophysiology. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (controls) and ten DPN patients were enrolled to undergo MR examinations. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of tibial nerve (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were measured. Unpaired t test and Levene tests were performed to assess differences between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for FA and ADC values. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between DTI and electrophysiology parameters in the patient group. Results: The FA values of TN and CPN in the DPN group were significantly lower and ADC were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Interobserver agreement was excellent. FA positively correlated and ADC negatively correlated with motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between motor nerve conduction amplitude and DTI parameters (p > 0.05). Moderate diagnostic accuracy of DTI was seen in the diagnosis of DPN. Conclusions: DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy and excellent interobserver performance in the detection of DPN involving the TN and CPN. There is moderate correlation with MCV. Key Points: • FA values of TN and CPN are significantly lower in DPN. • ADC values of TN and CPN are significantly higher in DPN. • DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy in detection of DPN. • There is excellent interobserver performance in DTI measurements. • Moderate correlation is seen between DTI parameters and MCV. © 2016, European Society of Radiology.

AB  - Background: While echocardiography is effective for initial identification of anatomic location, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a more advantageous modality for delineating tumor expanse, spread, and blood supply preoperatively. Emerging patterns may even help generate a specific diagnosis prior to biopsy and histopathology. Case Presentation: Our case of a 67-year-old male referred for cardiac magnetic resonance to further evaluate a cardiac mass highlights the sophisticated level of data which can be collected. Our case highlights the perfusion related findings associated with cardiac angiosarcoma. Conclusion: In this case, we present the diagnosis of right atrial cardiac angiosarcoma by multiple imaging modalities including MRI and subsequent angiography, allowing for prompt surgical intervention and initiation of adjuvant therapy that resulted in a survival time of 19 months. © 2017, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This study evaluates whether diffusion tensor imaging magnetic resonance neurography (DTI-MRN), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density can detect and grade neuropathic abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 49) were included-11 with severe polyneuropathy (sDPN), 13 with mild polyneuropathy (mDPN), and 25 without polyneuropathy (nDPN)-along with 30 healthy control subjects (HCs). Clinical examinations, nerve conduction studies, and vibratory perception thresholds determined the presence and severity of DPN. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal (tibial nerve) nerve segments of the lower extremity. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated, as were T2 relaxation time and proton spin density obtained from DTI-MRN. All magnetic resonance findings were related to the presence and severity of neuropathy. FA of the sciatic and tibial nerves was lowest in the sDPN group. Corresponding with this, proximal and distal ADCs were highest in patients with sDPN compared with patients with mDPN and nDPN, as well as the HCs. DTI-MRN correlated closely with the severity of neuropathy, demonstrating strong associations with sciatic and tibial nerve findings. Quantitative group differences in proton spin density were also significant, but less pronounced than those for DTI-MRN. In conclusion, DTI-MRN enables detection in peripheral nerves of abnormalities related to DPN, more so than proton spin density or T2 relaxation time. These abnormalities are likely to reflect pathology in sciatic and tibial nerve fibers. © 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate large coverage magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In this prospective study, 18 patients with CIDP and 18 healthy controls were examined by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 T. Lumbosacral plexus was imaged by a T2-weighted 3D sequence and peripheral nerves of the upper and lower extremity by axial T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences. Lesions were characterized by nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) and T2-weighted signal (nT2). Additionally, T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve was performed using a multi-spin-echo sequence. All patients received a complementary electrophysiological exam. Patients with CIDP exhibited increased nerve CSA and nT2 compared to controls (p < 0.05) in a proximally predominating pattern. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed the best diagnostic accuracy for CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (AUC = 0.88) and nT2 of the sciatic nerve (AUC = 0.88). CSA correlated with multiple electrophysiological parameters of demyelinating neuropathy (F wave latency, nerve conduction velocity) of sciatic and median nerve, while nT2 only correlated with F wave latency of sciatic and not median nerve. T2 relaxometry indicated that MR signal increase in CIDP was due to an increase in proton-spin-density (p < 0.05), and not due to the increase in T2 relaxation time. Both nT2 and CSA might aid in the diagnosis of CIDP, but CSA correlates more robustly with established electrophysiological parameters for CIDP. Since the best diagnostic accuracy was shown for proximal nerve locations, MRN may be a useful complementary tool in selected CIDP cases. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective motor neuron degeneration in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. It is generally accepted that ALS is caused by death of motor neurons, however the exact temporal cascade of degenerative processes is not yet completely known. To identify the early pathological changes in spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 ALS mice we performed a comprehensive longitudinal analysis employing diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging alongside histology and electron microscopy, in parallel with peripheral nerve histology. We showed the gradient of degeneration appearance in spinal cord white and gray matter, starting earliest in the ventral white matter, due to a cascade of pathological events including axon dysfunction and mitochondrial changes. Notably, we found that even the main sensory regions are affected by the neurodegenerative process at symptomatic disease phase. Overall our results attest the applicability of DTI in determining disease progression in ALS mice. These findings suggest that DTI could be potentially adapted in humans to aid the assessment of ALS progression and eventually the evaluation of treatment efficacy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although the neurofibromatoses consist of at least three autosomal dominantly inherited disorders, neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis, NF1 represents a multisystem pleiotropic condition very different from the other two. NF1 is a genetic syndrome first manifesting in childhood; affecting multiple organs, childhood development, and neurocognitive status; and presenting the clinician with often complex management decisions that require a multidisciplinary approach. Molecular genetic testing (see article for detailed discussion) is recommended to confirm NF1, particularly in children fulfilling only pigmentary features of the diagnostic criteria. Although cancer risk is not the major issue facing an individual with NF1 during childhood, the condition causes significantly increased malignancy risks compared with the general population. Specifically, NF1 is associated with highly elevated risks of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor as well as substantial risks of noninvasive pilocytic astrocytoma, particularly optic pathway glioma (OPG), which represent a major management issue. Until 8 years of age, clinical assessment for OPG is advised every 6 to 12 months, but routine MRI assessment is not currently advised in asymptomatic individuals with NF1 and no signs of clinical visual pathway disturbance. Routine surveillance for other malignancies is not recommended, but clinicians and parents should be aware of the small risks (<1%) of certain specific individual malignancies (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma). Tumors do contribute to both morbidity and mortality, especially later in life. A single whole-body MRI should be considered at transition to adulthood to assist in determining approaches to long-term follow-up. ©2017 AACR.

AB  - Objective The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of Ultra-high field [UHF] 7 Tesla [T] MRI as compared to 3T MRI in non-contrast enhanced [nCE] imaging of structural anatomy in the elbow, forearm, and hand [upper extremity]. Materials and method A wide range of sequences including T1 weighted [T1] volumetric interpolate breath-hold exam [VIBE], T2 weighted [T2] double-echo steady state [DESS], susceptibility weighted imaging [SWI], time-of-flight [TOF], diffusion tensor imaging [DTI], and diffusion spectrum imaging [DSI] were optimized and incorporated with a radiofrequency [RF] coil system composed of a transverse electromagnetic [TEM] transmit coil combined with an 8-channel receive-only array for 7T upper extremity [UE] imaging. In addition, Siemens optimized protocol/sequences were used on a 3T scanner and the resulting images from T1 VIBE and T2 DESS were compared to that obtained at 7T qualitatively and quantitatively [SWI was only qualitatively compared]. DSI studio was utilized to identify nerves based on analysis of diffusion weighted derived fractional anisotropy images. Images of forearm vasculature were extracted using a paint grow manual segmentation method based on MIPAV [Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization]. Results High resolution and high quality signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]-images of the hand, forearm, and elbow were acquired with nearly homogeneous 7T excitation. Measured [performed on the T1 VIBE and T2 DESS sequences] SNR and CNR values were almost doubled at 7T vs. 3T. Cartilage, synovial fluid and tendon structures could be seen with higher clarity in the 7T T1 and T2 weighted images. SWI allowed high resolution and better quality imaging of large and medium sized arteries and veins, capillary networks and arteriovenous anastomoses at 7T when compared to 3T. 7T diffusion weighted sequence [not performed at 3T] demonstrates that the forearm nerves are clearly delineated by fiber tractography. The proper digital palmar arteries and superficial palmar arch could also be clearly visualized using TOF nCE 7T MRI. Conclusion Ultra-high resolution neurovascular imaging in upper extremities is possible at 7T without use of renal toxic intravenous contrast. 7T MRI can provide superior peripheral nerve [based on fiber anisotropy and diffusion coefficient parameters derived from diffusion tensor/spectrum imaging] and vascular [nCE MRA and vessel segmentation] imaging. © 2017 Raval et al.

AB  - Purpose The present review highlights current concepts regarding the effects of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in skeletal muscle. It discusses the lack of effective pharmacologic treatments and the role of physical exercise intervention in limb protection and symptom reversal. It also highlights the importance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in providing a mechanistic understanding of the disease and helping develop targeted treatments. Methods This review provides a comprehensive reporting on the effects of DPN in the skeletal muscle of patients with diabetes. It also provides an update on the most recent trials of exercise intervention targeting DPN pathology. Lastly, we report on emerging MRI techniques that have shown promise in providing a mechanistic understanding of DPN and can help improve the design and implementation of clinical trials in the future. Findings Impairments in lower limb muscles reduce functional capacity and contribute to altered gait, increased fall risk, and impaired balance in patients with DPN. This finding is an important concern for patients with DPN because their falls are likely to be injurious and lead to bone fractures, poorly healing wounds, and chronic infections that may require amputation. Preliminary studies have shown that moderate-intensity exercise programs are well tolerated by patients with DPN. They can improve their cardiorespiratory function and partially reverse some of the symptoms of DPN. MRI has the potential to bring new mechanistic insights into the effects of DPN as well as to objectively measure small changes in DPN pathology as a result of intervention. Implications Noninvasive exercise intervention is particularly valuable in DPN because of its safety, low cost, and potential to augment pharmacologic interventions. As we gain a better mechanistic understanding of the disease, more targeted and effective interventions can be designed. © 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance neurography (DW-MRN) in the visualisation of extremity nerves in the wrist and palm. Methods: Thirty-two volunteers and 21 patients underwent imaging of the wrist and palm on a 3-T MR scanner. In all subjects, two radiologists evaluated the image quality on DW-MRN using a four-point grading scale. Kappa statistics were obtained for inter-observer performance. In volunteers, the chi-squared test was used to assess the differences in nerve visualisation on DW-MRN and axial fat-suppressed proton density weighted imaging (FS-PDWI). Results: In volunteers, the mean image quality scores for the median nerve (MN) and ulnar nerve (UN) were 3.71 ± 0.46 and 3.23 ± 0.67 for observer 1, and 3.70 ± 0.46 and 3.22 ± 0.71 for observer 2, respectively. The inter-observer agreement was excellent (k = 0.843) and good (k = 0.788), respectively. DW-MRN provided significantly improved visualisations of the second and the third common palmar digital nerves and three branches of UN compared with FS-PDWI (P < 0.05). In patients, the mean image quality scores for the two observers were 3.24 ± 0.62 and 3.10 ± 0.83, inter-observer performance was excellent (k = 0.842). Conclusions: DW-MRN is feasible for improved visualisation of extremity nerves and their lesions in the wrist and palm with adequate image quality, thereby providing a supplementary method to conventional MR imaging. Key points: • DW-MRN provides adequate image quality for wrist and palm neurography • DW-MRN performs similarly to FS-PDWI in nerve visualisation at the wrist • DW-MRN provides improved visualisation of small nerves in the palm • DW-MRN serves as a supplementary method to evaluate peripheral neuropathies. © 2016, European Society of Radiology.

AB  - Despite progress in understanding the pathophysiology of peripheral nervous injury and regeneration, as well as advancements in different surgical techniques, peripheral nerve repair and functional reconstruction is still a major challenge for orthopedic surgeons. We proposed a new method to reconstruct peripheral nerve injury by using a new type of biodegradable biomaterial nerve tube. This tube is suited to maximize re-innervation of the regenerating proximal stump into the degenerating distal stump by providing a conduit for nerve guidance. The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the long-term follow-up outcomes of different nerve repair technologies (biodegradable conduit small-gap tubulization and traditional epineurial suture) for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury. The nerve functional recovery conditions and electrophysiological studies were carried out at the 3-, 6-, 24- and 60-month after first surgery. Imageological diagnosis was carried out at the 60th month of the follow-up. Reconstruction images and related data along the injured nerves were compared with normal sides and correlated with electrophysiological neurography results. Complications were also recorded. The results showed that the clinical recovery effect of the injured nerves treated with biodegradable conduit small-gap (2 mm) tubulization was better than that treated with traditional epineurial neurorrhaphy in early period in this 5-year follow-up. Thus we conclude that biodegradable small-gap (2 mm) tubulization is an effective procedure in peripheral nerve injury treatment with an early good functional outcome, and presents potentially groundbreaking possibilities to help guide peripheral nerve reconstruction after injury in the future. © 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Objective The neurofibromatoses (NF) type 1 and 2 are hereditary tumor predisposition syndromes caused by germline mutations in the NF1 and NF2 tumor suppressor genes. In NF1 and 2, peripheral nerve tumors occur regularly. For further characterizing nerve ultrasound was performed in patients with NF1 and 2. Methods Patients with established diagnosis of NF1 (n = 27) and NF2 (n = 10) were included. Ultrasound of peripheral nerves and cervical roots was performed during routine follow-up visits. Healthy volunteers were studied for comparison. Results In patients with NF1, median cross-sectional area (CSA) of most nerves was significantly increased compared to controls and to NF2 due to generalized plexiform tumors, which arose out of multiple fascicles in 23 of 27 patients (85%). These were often accompanied by cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas. In NF2, the overall aspect of peripheral nerves consisted of localized schwannomas (80%) and, apart from that, normal nerve segments. Conclusion Nerve ultrasound is able to visualize different nerve pathologies in NF1 and NF2. It is a precise and inexpensive screening method for peripheral nerve manifestation in neurofibromatosis and should be considered as the first choice screening imaging modality for all peripheral nerves within reach of non-invasive ultrasound techniques. Significance Ultrasound patterns of peripheral nerve pathologies are described for the first time in a large cohort of patients with NF1 and NF2. It is a suitable screening tool and enables targeted MRI analysis. © 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology

AB  - Clinical trial design in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains hampered by a lack of reliable and sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. The present study evaluated peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a surrogate marker of axonal degeneration in ALS. Longitudinal studies were undertaken in 21 ALS patients studied at 0 and 3 months, and 19 patients at 0, 3 and 6 months, with results compared to 13 age-matched controls. Imaging metrics were correlated across a range of functional assessments including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R), lower limb muscle strength (Medical Research Council sum score, MRCSS-LL), compound muscle action potential amplitudes and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Fractional anisotropy was reduced at baseline in ALS patients in the tibial (p < 0.05), and peroneal nerve (p < 0.05). Fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity declined in the tibial nerve between baselines, 3- and 6-month scans (p < 0.01). From a functional perspective, ALSFRS-R correlated with fractional anisotropy values from tibial (R = 0.75, p < 0.001) and peroneal nerves (R = 0.52, p = 0.001). Similarly, peroneal nerve MUNE values correlated with fractional anisotropy values from the tibial (R = 0.48, p = 0.002) and peroneal nerve (R = 0.39, p = 0.01). There were correlations between the change in ALSFRS-R and tibial nerve axial diffusivity (R = 0.38, p = 0.02) and the change in MRCSS-LL and peroneal nerve fractional anisotropy (R = 0.44, p = 0.009). In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that some peripheral nerve DTI metrics are sensitive to axonal degeneration in ALS. Further, that DTI metrics correlated with measures of functional disability, strength and neurophysiological measures of lower motor neuron loss. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Peripheral nerve conduits were fabricated from biodegradable polyurethane (PU) which was synthesized by a waterborne process. The biodegradable PU was based on poly(ε-caprolactone) diol and polyethylene butylene adipate diol (2:3 molar ratio) as the soft segment. Conduits formed by the freeze-drying process had asymmetric microporous structure. The PU nerve conduits were used to bridge a 10-mm gap in rat sciatic nerve. Nerve regeneration was evaluated by walking track analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrophysiological, and histological analyses. Results demonstrated that after 6 weeks, walking function was recovered by 40%. MR images showed that the transected nerve was reconnected after 3 weeks and the diameter of the regenerated nerve increased from 3 to 6 weeks. The nerve conduction velocity of the regenerated nerve reached 50% of the normal value after 6 weeks. Histological examination revealed that the cross-sectional area of the regenerated nerve at the midconduit was 0.24 mm2 after 6 weeks. The efficacy of PU nerve conduits based on functional recovery and histology was superior to that of commercial conduits (Neurotube). The PU nerve conduit developed in this study may be a potential candidate for clinical peripheral nerve tissue engineering. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Widespread sensory deficits occur in 20–40% of chronic pain patients on the side of pain, independent of pain aetiology, and are known as nondermatomal sensory deficits (NDSDs). NDSDs can occur in absence of central or peripheral nervous system lesions. We hypothesised that NDSDs were associated with cerebral grey matter changes in the sensory system and in pain processing regions, detectable with voxel-based morphometry. Methods: Twenty-five patients with NDSDs, 23 patients without NDSDs (“pain-only”), and 29 healthy controls were studied with high resolution structural MRI of the brain. A comprehensive clinical and psychiatric evaluation based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual was performed in all patients. Results: Patients with NDSDs and “pain-only” did not differ concerning demographic data and psychiatric diagnoses, although anxiety scores (HADS-A) were higher in patients with NDSDs. In patients with NDSDs, grey matter increases were found in the right primary sensory cortex, thalamus, and bilaterally in lateral temporal regions and the hippocampus/fusiform gyrus. “Pain-only” patients showed a bilateral grey matter increase in the posterior insula and less pronounced changes in sensorimotor cortex. Conclusions: Dysfunctional sensory processing in patients with NDSDs is associated with complex changes in grey matter volume, involving the somatosensory system and temporal regions. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate if diffusion tensor imaging MR neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect lesions of peripheral nerves in patients with type 1 diabetes. Materials and Methods: Eleven type 1 diabetic patients with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 type 1 diabetic patients without polyneuropathy (nDPN), and 10 healthy controls (HC) were investigated with a 3T MRI scanner. Clinical examinations, nerve-conduction studies, and vibratory-perception thresholds determined the presence of DPN. DTI-MRN (voxel size: 1.4 × 1.4 × 3 mm3; b-values: 0, 800 s/mm2) covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions of the lower extremity (tibial nerve). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated and compared to T2-relaxometry and proton-spin density obtained from a multiecho turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated DTI reproducibility, repeatability, and diagnostic accuracy. Results: DTI-MRN could accurately discriminate between DPN, nDPN, and HC. The proximal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 0.37 ± 0.06; nDPN 0.47 ± 0.03; HC 0.49 ± 0.06; P &lt; 0.01). In addition, distal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 0.31 ± 0.05; nDPN 0.41 ± 0.07; HC 0.43 ± 0.08; P &lt; 0.01). Likewise, proximal ADC was highest in DPN (DPN 1.69 ± 0.25 × 10−3mm2/s; nDPN 1.50 ± 0.06 × 10−3mm2/s; HC 1.42 ± 0.12 × 10−3mm2/s; P &lt; 0.01) as was distal ADC (DPN 1.87 ± 0.45 × 10−3mm2/s; nDPN 1.59 ± 0.19 × 10−3mm2/s; HC 1.57 ± 0.26 × 10−3mm2/s; P = 0.09). The combined interclass-correlation (ICC) coefficient of DTI reproducibility and repeatability was high in the sciatic nerve (ICC: FA = 0.86; ADC = 0.85) and the tibial nerve (ICC: FA = 0.78; ADC = 0.66). T2-relaxometry and proton-spin-density did not enable detection of neuropathy. Conclusion: DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher ADC. These alterations are likely to reflect proximal and distal nerve fiber pathology. Level of Evidence: 1. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely used to visualize peripheral nerves, but the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed using DTI. However, there are no data regarding the association among microstructural changes evaluated using DTI, the symptoms assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the duration of symptoms after surgery in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Thirty patients with unilateral radiculopathy were investigated using DTI. The changes in the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values as well as the correlation between these changes and the severity and duration of the clinical symptoms were investigated before and at least one month after surgery. The FA values were significantly increased after surgical treatment (p < 0.0001). Both the ADC and ODI values were noticeably decreased (p < 0.0001). A strong positive correlation between the preoperative and postoperative DTI parameters (p < 0.0001) as well as between the preoperative ODI and postoperative ODI/ODI changes (p < 0.0001) were found. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the changes in the DTI parameters and changes in the ODI (p < 0.0001). This preliminary study suggests it may be possible to use DTI to diagnose, quantitatively evaluate and follow-up patients with LDH. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Exposure to explosive armaments during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom contributed to approximately 14% of the 352 612 traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnoses in the US military between 2000 and 2016. The US Department of Defense issued guidelines in 2009 to (1) standardize TBI diagnostic criteria; (2) classify TBI according to mechanism and severity; (3) categorize TBI symptoms as somatic, psychological, or cognitive; and (4) systematize types of care given during the acute and rehabilitation stages of TBI treatment. Polytrauma and associated psychological and neurologic conditions may create barriers to optimal rehabilitation from TBI. Given the completion of recent combat operations and the transition of TBI patients into long-term care within the US Department of Veterans Affairs system, a review of the literature concerning TBI is timely. Long-term follow-up care for patients who have sustained TBI will remain a critical issue for the US military. © 2017, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The effect of an additional neurological injury (suprascapular nerve traction injury) to a chronically retracted rotator cuff muscle is incompletely understood and warrants clarification. Purpose: To investigate the microscopic and macroscopic muscle degeneration patterns caused by tendon release and/or muscle denervation in a sheep rotator cuff model. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Infraspinatus muscle biopsy specimens (for histological analysis) were obtained from 18 Swiss alpine sheep before and 16 weeks after release of the infraspinatus tendon (tenotomy [T] group; n = 6), transection of the suprascapular nerve (neurectomy [N] group; n = 6), or tendon release plus nerve transection (tenotomy + neurectomy [T&N] group; n = 6). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) were used to assess retraction (CT), muscle density (CT), volume (MRI T2), and fat fraction (MRI Dixon). Stiffness of the infraspinatus was measured with a spring scale. Results: At 16 weeks postoperatively, the mean infraspinatus muscle volume had decreased significantly more after neurectomy (to 47% ± 7% of the original volume; P =.001) and tenotomy plus neurectomy (48% ± 13%; P =.005) than after tenotomy alone (78% ± 11%). Conversely, the mean amount of intramuscular fat (CT/MRI Dixon) was not significantly different in the 3 groups (T group: 50% ± 9%; N group: 40% ± 11%; T&N group: 46% ± 10%) after 16 weeks. The mean myotendinous retraction (CT) was not significantly different in the T and T&N groups (5.8 ± 1.0 cm and 6.4 ± 0.4 cm, respectively; P =.26). Stiffness was, however, most increased after additional neurectomy. In contrast to muscle changes after tendon release, denervation of the muscle led to a decrease in the pennation angle of lengthened muscle fibers, with a reduced mean cross-sectional area of pooled muscle fibers, a slow- to fast-type transformation, and an increase in the area percentage of hybrid fibers, leading to overall significantly greater atrophy of the corresponding muscle. Conclusion: Although it is unclear which experimental group (T or T&N) most accurately reflects the clinical scenario in a given case, these findings provide baseline information for clinical differentiation between muscle changes caused by denervation or rotator cuff tendon lesions. Clinical Relevance: The findings of this study help to understand how and to which extent a neurological lesion of the supplying suprascapular nerve could influence the pattern of anatomic-physiological muscular changes after rotator cuff tendon tears. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: To determine the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics as biomarkers for the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in acute peripheral nerve injury. Materials and Methods: Forty-four adult rats received subepineurial microinjection of MSCs (n = 22) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n = 22) 1 week after the sciatic nerve trunk crush injury. Sequential fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging, T2 measurement, DTI and sciatic nerve functional assessment were performed at a 3.0 Tesla MR unit over an 8-week follow-up, with histological assessments performed at regular intervals. The sciatic nerve function index, T2 value, and DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity values of the distal stumps of crushed nerves were measured and compared between the two groups. Results: Nerves treated with MSCs showed better functional recovery and exhibited more pronounced nerve regeneration compared with nerves treated with PBS. T2 values in nerves treated with MSCs or PBS showed a similar change pattern (P = 0.174), while FA and RD values in nerves treated with MSCs showed more rapid return (one week earlier) to baseline level than nerves treated with PBS (P = 0.045; 0.035). Nerves treated with MSCs had higher FA and lower RD values than nerves treated with PBS during the period from 2 to 3 weeks after surgery (P ≤ 0.0001, 0.004; P = 0.004, 0.006). Conclusion: FA and RD values derived from DTI might be used as sensitive biomarkers for detecting the therapeutic effect of stem cells in acute peripheral nerve crush injuries. Level of Evidence: 2.

AB  - Isolated traumatic oculomotor nerve palsy without internal ophthalmoplegia is a rare condition after closed head trauma. The nerve strain leads to intraneural edema with nerve swelling on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and traumatic disruption of the blood peripheral nerve barrier with contrast enhancement on T1-weighted MR images. In this patient, susceptibility-weighted MR imaging allowed the direct visualization of the intraneural hemorrhage after suspected traumatic diffuse neuronal axonal injury. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Purpose of Review: This study aimed to evaluate current barriers to HIV cure strategies and interventions for neurocognitive dysfunction with a particular focus on recent advancements over the last 3 years. Recent Findings: Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) poses challenges to minimise neurotoxicity, whilst ensuring blood-brain barrier penetration and minimising the risk of cerebrovascular disease. CSF biomarkers, BCL11B and neurofilament light chain may be implicated with a neuroinflammatory cascade leading to cognitive impairment. Diagnostic imaging with diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state fMRI show promise in future diagnosis and monitoring of HAND. Summary: The introduction of ART has resulted in a dramatic decline in HIV-associated dementia. Despite this reduction, milder forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) are still prevalent and are clinically significant. The central nervous system (CNS) has been recognised as a probable reservoir and sanctuary for HIV, representing a significant barrier to management interventions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Aim To investigate the applicability of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance neurography (DW-MRN) in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Materials and methods In total, 47 patients with CTS (69 wrists) and 19 normal participants (38 wrists) was included in this study. Cross-sectional area (CSA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median nerves in the carpal tunnel were determined using DW-MRN. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Results No significant differences in age or body mass index (BMI) were observed between the control and CTS groups. DW-MRN imaging showed obvious hyperintensity in the lesions in CTS wrists, while other nerve regions were related to slight hyperintensity. Interobserver variability analysis indicated excellent agreement regarding both the CSA and ADC measurements for the control and CTS groups. Both the mean CSA and ADC values of the median nerves in carpal tunnel in the CTS group were significantly higher than the control group. According to the ROC analysis, the CSA cut-off value was 11.7 mm2, and sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 89.5%, respectively. Conversely, the median nerve ADC cut-off value was 1.047×10−3 mm2/s. The sensitivity and specificity were 91.3% and 76.3.9%, respectively. Conclusion DW-MRN represents a highly reproducible diagnostic technique for CTS. The ADC value of median nerves in the carpal tunnel is significantly higher in CTS patients, which provides a potential powerful tool for the disease diagnosis. © 2016

AB  - Life-threatening arrhythmias are often found in heart diseases, but they are rare as clinical symptoms of Churg-Strauss syndrome. We report a case of a 66-year-old woman with symptomatic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia as the first sign of Churg-Strauss syndrome. Cardiac manifestations were the main clinical symptoms of the disease, and changes in other organs were weakly expressed. Furthermore, increased serum IgG4 level was revealed. It was the reason for the differential diagnosis with IgG4-related diseases. Echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and histopathological analysis of biopsies had an important role in diagnosis. <Learning objective: Ventricular arrhythmias are rare clinical symptoms of Churg-Strauss syndrome. This case is interesting because cardiac manifestations were the main clinical symptom of the disease, and changes in other organs were weakly expressed. Echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and histopathological analysis of biopsies had an important role in diagnosis. Increased serum IgG4 level was the reason for the differential diagnosis with IgG4-related diseases. Churg-Strauss syndrome should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in patients with noncoronary ventricular arrhythmias.> © 2016 Japanese College of Cardiology

AB  - Background: Peripheral nerve injury is a common and important cause of morbidity and disability in patients who have suffered a traumatic injury, particularly younger people. Various different injuries can result in damage to specific nerves. In patients with multiple trauma, the prevalence of peripheral nerve injury is estimated at 2.8%, but can reach 5% with the inclusion of brachial plexus involvement. Physical examination, as well as the origin and location of the trauma, can indicate the nerve involved and the type of nerve damage. However, the depth and severity of damage, and the structures involved often cannot be determined initially, but depend on longer periods of observation to reach a definitive and accurate diagnosis for which treatment can be proposed. Current approaches to locate and assess the severity of traumatic nerve injury involve clinical and electrodiagnostic studies. From a clinical and neurophysiological point of view, nerve injuries are classified in an attempt to correlate the degree of injury with symptoms, type of pathology, and prognosis, as well as to determine the therapy to be adopted. Objectives: MRI in the diagnosis of traumatic peripheral nerve injury has increasingly been used by surgeons in clinical practice. In this article, we analyze the use of magnetic resonance (MR) for the evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve diseases that are surgically treatable. We also consider basic concepts in the evaluation of technical and MR signs of peripheral nerve injuries. Materials and methods: Studies were identified following a computerized search of MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present), and the Cochrane database. The MEDLINE search was conducted on PUBMED, the EMBASE search was conducted on OVID, and the Cochrane database was conducted using their online library. A set was created using the terms: ‘traumatic’, ‘nerve’, and ‘resonance’. Results: The included articles were identified using a computerized search and the resulting databases were then sorted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This yielded 10,340 articles (MEDLINE, n = 758; EMBASE, n = 9564; and Cochrane, n = 18). A search strategy was then built by excluding articles that only concern plexus injury and adding the terms ‘neuropathies’, ‘DTI’ and ‘neurotmesis’. In total, seven studies were included in the review effectively addressing the role of MRI in the evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injury. We extracted all relevant information on the imaging findings and the use of magnetic resonance in trauma. We did not include technical or specific radiological aspects of the imaging techniques. Conclusions: These seven articles were subsequently evaluated by analyzing their results, methodological approach, and conclusions presented. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Foot and ankle disorders are common in everyday clinical practice. MR imaging is frequently required for diagnosis given the variety and complexity of foot and ankle anatomy. Although conventional MR imaging plays a significant role in diagnosis, contemporary management increasingly relies on advanced imaging for monitoring therapeutic response. There is an expanding need for identification of biomarkers for musculoskeletal tissues. Advanced imaging techniques capable of imaging these tissue substrates will be increasingly used in routine clinical practice. Radiologists should therefore become familiar with these innovative MR techniques. Many such techniques are already widely used in other organ systems. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic brain condition involving the trigeminal nerve and characterized by severe and recurrent facial pain. Although the cause of TN has been researched extensively, there is a lack of convergence on the physiologic processes leading to pain symptoms. This review seeks to better elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of TN by analyzing the outcomes of studies that use magnetic resonance structural imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging to examine nerve damage in patients with TN. Methods Performing a structured review of the literature, the authors included human magnetic resonance anatomic and diffusion-weighted imaging studies aimed at visualizing the trigeminal nerve or measuring neural damage pertaining to TN. Studies that measured and compared nerve damage in the affected and unaffected sides in patients or patients and controls were analyzed for neural changes associated with TN. Results Twenty-five studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, the data from the anatomic and diffusion studies showed decreased volume and cross-sectional area, decreased fractional anisotropy, and increased apparent diffusion coefficient and diffusivity associated with the affected side of patients compared with the unaffected side as well as in patients compared with controls. Conclusions A review of the studies included indicates that neural differences exist between the affected and unaffected sides in patients as well as between patients and controls in both structural and diffusion metrics. The amalgamated data suggest that damage of the trigeminal nerve tissue is commonly found in patients with TN and could be a primary factor in TN pathophysiology. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Regenerative medicine holds the promise of engineering functional tissues or organs to heal or replace abnormal and necrotic tissues/organs, offering hope for filling the gap between organ shortage and transplantation needs. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is evolving into an unparalleled biomanufacturing technology due to its high-integration potential for patient-specific designs, precise and rapid manufacturing capabilities with high resolution, and unprecedented versatility. It enables precise control over multiple compositions, spatial distributions, and architectural accuracy/complexity, therefore achieving effective recapitulation of microstructure, architecture, mechanical properties, and biological functions of target tissues and organs. Here we provide an overview of recent advances in 3D bioprinting technology, as well as design concepts of bioinks suitable for the bioprinting process. We focus on the applications of this technology for engineering living organs, focusing more specifically on vasculature, neural networks, the heart and liver. We conclude with current challenges and the technical perspective for further development of 3D organ bioprinting. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Nerve sheath tumors are a distinct type of soft tissue tumors. The updated WHO classification of nerve sheath tumors includes several new benign and malignant nerve sheath tumor types. Imaging features suggestive for nerve sheath tumors include location near a nerve, fusiform shape, tail sign, split-fat sign, target sign, fascicular sign, and degenerative muscle changes. On imaging studies, the differential diagnosis between a schwannoma and a neurofibroma cannot be reliably made. MRI features suggestive of a schwannoma include a fascicular appearance on T2-weighted images and diffuse enhancement. Imaging findings suggestive of a neurofibroma include a target sign on T2-weighted images and central enhancement. Criteria that can be of help in establishing the diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) include a large mass (>5 cm) with mass effect, perilesional edema, invasion of fat planes or neighboring structures, intratumoral cystic changes, peripheral contrast enhancement on static contrast-enhanced MRI, early arterial enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values >1.1 × 10-3mm/s2 on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)/diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), trimethylamine (TMA) fraction >50 % on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and SUVmax >3-4 on 18F-FDG PET. Nerve sheath tumors represent essential clinical manifestations of a group of inherited genetic disorders known as the neurofibromatoses. The three most widely recognized types of neurofibromatosis are neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and schwannomatosis. Plexiform neurofibromas are the hallmark lesion of NF1 and carry a lifetime risk of 10 % for malignant degeneration, necessitating vigilant surveillance. Due to the absence of any radiation exposure, whole-body MRI may be used for serial follow-up of individuals with NF1. 18F-FDG PET/CT allows a highly sensitive but less specific detection of MPNSTs and should be used in case of potential malignant transformation of nerve sheath tumors. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Background: Most of peripheral nerve tumors are benign. Surgical removal is still the standard treatment and should be considered in patients with symptoms. Objective: The operation endeavors to excise tumors concomitant with preservation of neural function. Material and Method: The authors reviewed medical literatures in terms of peripheral nerve tumor classification, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring and surgical treatment. Results: The most common peripheral nerve tumor is schwannoma. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare entity and often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Patients with peripheral nerve tumors can present with palpable mass, pain, neurological deficits and pressure symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard method for diagnosis. Ultrasonography, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tractography and electrophysiological studies are optional presurgical investigations. Operation complications can be avoided by using intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. Surgery aims to remove the tumors totally. Functional nerve fascicles must be preserved. Radical resection is necessary in MPNST to improve survival outcomes. Conclusion: Most of peripheral nerve tumors can be resected totally and have good prognosis. Diagnosis of the tumors is based on clinical examination and imaging studies. Malignant tumors must be treated aggressively to prolong survival rate. © 2017, Medical Association of Thailand.

AB  - Objective. Despite modern antiretroviral therapy, HIV-associated neuropathy is one of the most prevalent, disabling and treatment-resistant complications of HIV disease. The presence and intensity of distal neuropathic pain is not fully explained by the degree of peripheral nerve damage. A better understanding of brain structure in HIV distal neuropathic pain may help explain why some patients with HIV neuropathy report pain while the majority does not. Previously, we reported that more intense distal neuropathic pain was associated with smaller total cerebral cortical gray matter volumes. The objective of this study was to determine which parts of the cortex are smaller. Methods. HIV positive individuals with and without distal neuropathic pain enrolled in the multisite (N5233) CNS HIV Antiretroviral Treatment Effects (CHARTER) study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate regional brain volumes in these structural brain images. Results. Left ventral posterior cingulate cortex was smaller for HIV positive individuals with versus without distal neuropathic pain (peak P50.017; peak t55.15; MNI coordinates x526, y5254, z520). Regional brain volumes within cortical gray matter structures typically associated with pain processing were also smaller for HIV positive individuals having higher intensity ratings of distal neuropathic pain. Conclusions. The posterior cingulate is thought to be involved in inhibiting the perception of painful stimuli. Mechanistically a smaller posterior cingulate cortex structure may be related to reduced anti-nociception contributing to increased distal neuropathic pain. © 2017, Oxford University Press.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to compare engineered nerve conduits constructed from porcine-derived urinary bladder matrix (UBM) with the criterion-standard nerve autografts, for segmental loss peripheral nerve repairs. Methods: Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups. All underwent a 10-mm sciatic nerve gap injury. This was repaired using either (1) reverse autograft - the 10-mm cut segment was oriented 180 degrees and used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps or (2) UBM conduit - the 10-mm nerve gap was bridged with UBM conduit. Behavior assessments such as sciatic function index and foot fault asymmetry scores were performed weekly. At 3-or 6-week time endpoints, the repaired nerves and bilateral gastrocnemius/soleus muscles were harvested from each animal. Nerves were evaluated using immunohistochemistry for motor and sensory axon staining and with diffusion tensor imaging. The net wet muscle weights were calculated to assess the degree of muscle atrophy. Results: The UBM group demonstrated significantly improved foot fault asymmetry scores at 2 and 4 weeks, whereas there was no difference in sciatic function index. The net muscle weights were similar between both groups. Motor axon counts proximal/inside/distal to the conduit/graft were similar between UBM conduits and reverse autografts, whereas sensory axon counts within and distal to the conduit were significantly higher than those of the autograft at 6 weeks. Sensory axonal regeneration seemed to be adherent to the inner surface of the UBM conduit, whereas it had a scattered appearance in autografts. Diffusion tensor imaging parameters between groups were similar. Conclusions: Urinary bladder matrix conduits prove to be at least similar to nerve autografts for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries with a short gap. The matrix perhaps serves as a scaffold to augment sensory nerve growth. Clinical Relevance: In a clinical setting, UBM may eliminate the donor site morbidity and increased operative time associated with nerve autografting. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Technical advances are rapidly changing the clinical and instrumental approach to peripheral nerve diseases. Magnetic resonance neurography, diffusion tensor imaging and nerve ultrasonography are increasingly entering the diagnostic workup of peripheral neuropathies as tools that complement neurophysiology and enable investigation of proximal structures, such as plexuses and roots. Progress in the design of magnetic resonance scanners and sequences, and the development of high-frequency ultrasound probes mean that high-resolution peripheral nerve imaging is possible, enabling detailed examination of nerve size, morphology and internal fascicular structure that can integrate nerve conduction studies into clinical practice. In the growing field of small-fibre neuropathy in which traditional nerve conduction studies are of little or no use, skin biopsy has become a reliable tool for diagnosis. Corneal confocal microscopy nociceptive evoked potentials and microneurography are emerging techniques that are mainly used in clinical research settings, but have increasing relevance to clinical practice. We review these new and emerging techniques and their effects on diagnosis, treatment strategies and prognosis in a variety of peripheral neuropathies, including entrapments, brachial plexopathies, immune and inherited neuropathies, and small-fibre neuropathies. We discuss the most promising research findings and their potential for future application in clinical practice. © 2017 Macmilan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. Al rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In addition to fiber tracking, stereoscopic display of the peripheral nerves can be obtained based on magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using post-processing methods, including volume rendering (VR) and maximum intensity projection (MIP). However, sufficient suppression of the image noise remains a challenge. Objectives: To achieve three-dimensional (3D) display of the peripheral nerves in the wrist region using two post-processing methods for DTI, i.e. VR reconstruction for single-direction images and the subtraction of unidirectionally encoded images for suppression of heavily isotropic objects (SUSHI); to compare the quality of images obtained via the two approaches; and to explore their clinical applications. Materials and Methods: We performed DTI scans using 6 (DTI6) and 25 (DTI25) encoding diffusion directions for 20 wrists of 10 healthy adult volunteers. We used VR to reconstruct 2 types of images: 1, single-direction (anterior-posterior [AP] direction) and 2, SUSHI (AP direction with the subtraction of the superior-inferior [SI] direction). The 3D nerve image quality, noise level, and degree of noise-removal difficulty were evaluated according to custom evaluation scales. The preliminary clinical applications of these methods were explored through follow-ups with patients with nerve laceration in the wrist region. Results: Single-direction VR reconstruction clearly showed the nerves for both DTI6 and DTI25 but with obvious noise. In DTI25, VR reconstruction for SUSHI showed the nerves clearly with excellent nerve signal intensity. In DTI6, SUSHI post-processing lost some ulnar nerve signal intensity, resulting in a significant difference in image quality scores between single-direction images and SUSHI. Most of the noise was removed after SUSHI post-processing. Conclusion: VR reconstruction for both single-direction images and SUSHI using DTI25 raw data provides excellent 3D displays of the peripheral nerves in the wrist region. SUSHI post-processing is a useful denoising tool because it automatically reduces the majority of isotropic object noise. © 2016, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Iranian Society of Radiology.

AB  - Here, we report the structural evidence of cerebral white matter abnormalities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) patients and the relationship between these abnormalities and clinical disability. Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in CMT patients with demyelinating (CMT1A/CMT1E), axonal (CMT2A/CMT2E), or intermediate (CMTX1/DI-CMT) peripheral neuropathy. Although all patients had normal brain magnetic resonance imaging, all genetic subgroups except CMT1A had abnormal DTI findings indicative of significant cerebral white matter abnormalities: decreased fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity, and increased radial diffusivity. DTI abnormalities were correlated with clinical disability, suggesting that there is comorbidity of central nervous system damage with peripheral neuropathy in CMT patients.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the central and peripheral nervous system, and also in the visceral organs. NIID has been considered to be a heterogeneous disease because of the highly variable clinical manifestations, and ante-mortem diagnosis has been difficult. However, since we reported the usefulness of skin biopsy for the diagnosis of NIID, the number of NIID diagnoses has increased, in particular adult-onset NIID. In this study, we studied 57 cases of adult-onset NIID and described their clinical and pathological features. We analysed both NIID cases diagnosed by post-mortem dissection and by ante-mortem skin biopsy based on the presence of characteristic eosinophilic, hyaline and ubiquitin-positive intanuclear inclusion: 38 sporadic cases and 19 familial cases, from six families. In the sporadic NIID cases with onset age from 51 to 76, dementia was the most prominent initial symptom (94.7%) as designated 'dementia dominant group', followed by miosis, ataxia and unconsciousness. Muscle weakness and sensory disturbance were also observed. It was observed that, in familial NIID cases with onset age less than 40 years, muscle weakness was seen most frequently (100%), as designated 'limb weakness group', followed by sensory disturbance, miosis, bladder dysfunction, and dementia. In familial cases with more than 40 years of onset age, dementia was most prominent (100%). Elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and abnormal nerve conduction were frequently observed in both sporadic and familial NIID cases. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed high intensity signal in corticomedullary junction in diffusion-weighted image in both sporadic and familial NIID cases, a strong clue to the diagnosis. All of the dementia dominant cases presented with this type of leukoencephalopathy on head magnetic resonance imaging. Both sporadic and familial NIID cases presented with a decline in Mini-Mental State Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery scores. Based on these clinicopathological features, we proposed a diagnosis flow chart of adult-onset NIID. Our study suggested that the prevalence rate of adult-onset NIID may be higher than previously thought, and that NIID may be underdiagnosed. We should take NIID into account for differential diagnosis of leukoencephalopathy and neuropathy. © The Author (2016). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain.

AB  - Background Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common mononeuropathy of the upper extremity. One rare cause of UNE is nerve mass lesions, including intraneural ganglion cysts (IGCs). IGC imaging studies provide important information that may determine the nature of a peripheral nerve mass lesion. Case Description We present the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with rapid deterioration of left hand function over 2 months with weakness of fine motor control, grip strength, and dysesthesia in the ulnar nerve distribution. Preoperative imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the elbow, postcontrast studies, diffusion-weighted imaging, and apparent diffusion coefficient measurements, suggested a highly cellular tumor. Diffusion tensor tractography also revealed imaging features suggestive of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. During the operation, a sample of the lesion was sent for frozen section. There were no features of malignancy, and the pathologist could not determine a diagnosis based on the tissue sample sent. An intraoperative decision was made not to divide the ulnar nerve above and below the lesion. The IGC was successfully managed by identifying a suitable plane of dissection and cyst resection. Conclusions This case demonstrates that MRI studies indicating malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor must be considered with some caution and corroborated with supportive features on operative inspection and biopsy before radical resection is undertaken. Furthermore, for any nerve mass lesion immediately adjacent to a joint, the differential diagnosis of an IGC should be considered. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Differentiating multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is important, as MMN is a difficult, but treatable disorder. Methods: We studied peripheral nerve imaging techniques in differentiating MMN from ALS by measuring the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median and ulnar nerves in the forearms using high resolution ultrasound (HRUS) and MRI. Results: HRUS CSA values of the median nerve in the forearm (P = 0.002) and the ulnar nerve distal to the sulcus (P = 0.009) were significantly enlarged in patients with MMN. There was a positive correlation between CSA as measured with HRUS and MRI (Spearman rho 0.60; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Peripheral nerve imaging is a potentially powerful technique to distinguish MMN from ALS. Muscle Nerve, 2016 Muscle Nerve 54: 1133–1135, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Wernicke's encephalopathy is often undiagnosed, particularly in non-alcoholics. There are very few reports of non-alcoholic patients diagnosed with Korsakoff syndrome in the absence of a prior diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy and no studies of diffusion tensor imaging in non-alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome. We report on three non-alcoholic psychiatric patients (all women) with long-term non-progressive memory impairment that developed after malnutrition accompanied by at least one of the three Wernicke's encephalopathy manifestations: ocular abnormalities, ataxia or unsteadiness, and an altered mental state or mild memory impairment. In neuropsychological examination, all patients had memory impairment, including intrusions. One patient had mild cerebellar vermis atrophy in MRI taken after the second episode of Wernicke's encephalopathy. The same patient had mild hypometabolism in the lateral cortex of the temporal lobes. Another patient had mild symmetrical atrophy and hypometabolism of the superior frontal lobes. Two patients were examined with diffusion tensor imaging. Reduced fractional anisotropy values were found in the corona radiata in two patients, and the uncinate fasciculus and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in one patient. Our results suggest that non-alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome is underdiagnosed. Psychiatric patients with long-term memory impairment may have Korsakoff syndrome and, therefore, they should be evaluated for a history of previously undiagnosed Wernicke's encephalopathy. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric (NP) involvement in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), can be a severe and troubling manifestation of the disease that heavily impacts patient's health, quality of life and disease outcome. It is one of the most complex expressions of SLE which can affect central, peripheral and autonomous nervous system. Complex interrelated pathogenetic mechanisms, including genetic factors, vasculopathy, vascular occlusion, neuroendocrine-immune imbalance, tissue and neuronal damage mediated by autoantibodies, inflammatory mediators, blood brain barrier dysfunction and direct neuronal cell death can be all involved. About NPSLE a number of issues are still matter of debate: from classification and burden of NPSLE to attribution and diagnosis. The role of neuroimaging and new methods of investigation still remain pivotal and rapidly evolving as well as is the increasing knowledge in the pathogenesis. Overall, two main pathogenetic pathways have been recognized yielding different clinical phenotypes: a predominant ischemic-vascular one involving large and small blood vessels, mediated by aPL, immune complexes and leuko-agglutination which it is manifested with more frequent focal NP clinical pictures and a predominantly inflammatory-neurotoxic one mediated by complement activation, increased permeability of the BBB, intrathecal migration of autoantibodies, local production of immune complexes and pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators usually appearing as diffuse NP manifestations. In the attempt to depict a journey throughout NPSLE from diagnosis to a reasoned therapeutic approach, classification, epidemiology, attribution, risk factors, diagnostic challenges, neuroimaging techniques and pathogenesis will be considered in this narrative review based on the most relevant and recent published data. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Krabbe's disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder resulting from deficiency of β-galactocerebrosidase that affects primarily cerebral white matter and peripheral nerves. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to changes in white matter myelination, but its assessment is based purely on qualitative, visual inspection, and it is subject to interobserver variability and open to reader bias. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced MRI technique that provides quantitative information about the microscopic structural organization of the white matter and changes in cell density and myelination, and it is a suitable MRI tool for studying Krabbe's disease. This Review discusses the available studies on the application of quantitative DTI analysis to assess white matter changes in patients with Krabbe's disease. Quantitative analysis of DTI scalars, especially radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, has been shown to be a sensitive in vivo biomarker of white matter microstructural damage in Krabbe's disease, to detect early white matter injury in asymptomatic neonates with Krabbe's disease, to predict motor and cognitive functions after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and to serve as a measurement for monitoring effects of HSCT on white matter development in Krabbe's disease. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: We investigated whether MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of the cervical spinal cord could aid the (differential) diagnosis of sensory neuronopathies, an underdiagnosed group of diseases of the peripheral nervous system. Methods: We obtained spinal cord DTI and T2WI at 3 T from 28 patients, 14 diabetic subjects with sensory-motor distal polyneuropathy, and 20 healthy controls. We quantified DTI-based parameters and looked at the hyperintense T2W signal at the spinal cord posterior columns. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values at C2–C3 and C3–C4 levels were compared between groups. We also compared average fractional anisotropy (mean of values at C2–C3 and C3–C4 levels). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine diagnostic accuracy of average fractional anisotropy, and we compared its sensitivity against the hyperintense signal in segregating patients from the other subjects. Results: Mean age and disease duration were 52 ± 10 and 11.4 ± 9.3 years in the patient group. Eighteen subjects had idiopathic disease and 6 dysimmune etiology. Fractional anisotropy at C3–C4 level and average fractional anisotropy were significantly different between patients and healthy controls (p < 0.001 and <0.001) and between patients and diabetic subjects (p = 0.019 and 0.027). Average fractional anisotropy presented an area under the curve of 0.838. Moreover, it had higher sensitivity than visual detection of the hyperintense signal (0.86 vs. 0.54), particularly for patients with short disease duration. Conclusion: DTI-based analysis enables in vivo detection of posterior column damage in sensory neuronopathy patients and is a useful diagnostic test for this condition. It also helps the differential diagnosis between sensory neuronopathy and distal polyneuropathies. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Objective The use of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was evaluated in assessing cochlear nerve deficiency (CND) and its effect on normal maturation of auditory tract. Methods 25 CND patients and 25 controls (age matched: 2 months to 17 years, gender matched) were evaluated by mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis, and radial kurtosis and compared against fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivities in internal auditory canal (IAC), lateral lemniscus (LL) and inferior colliculus (IC). The age related changes of auditory tract were studied through Pearson correlation between estimated indices and age of both CND and control populations. Results Significant loss of MK (IAC: 10.71%, IC: 10.87%, LL: 15.63%) was observed in CND cases as against moderate reduction in FA (IAC: 8.57%, IC: 10%, LL: 7.69%) in all three anatomical locations. Similarly, substantial decline is observed in radial kurtosis (IAC: 27.03%, IC: 33.33%, LL: 31.43%) in comparison to moderate increase in radial diffusivity (IAC: 13.46%, IC: 24.39%, LL: 24%) in CND cases. No statistically significant change was seen in both axial kurtosis and diffusivities. In control populations, MK (r = 0.473, p = 0.011) and radial kurtosis (r = 0.418, p = 0.016) correlate positively with age and had no correlation in case of CND cases. FA (r = 0.356, p = 0.019) minimally correlated with age in control population but showed no statistically significant correlation in CND cases (r = 0.198, p = 0.036). Conclusion DKI metrics performed better than DTI in assessing microstructural changes of CND. In particular, MK and radial kurtosis are found to be more sensitive enough to differentiate the normal maturation of cochlear nerve from CND cases. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose To develop an in-vivo imaging method for the measurement of dorsal-root-ganglia-(DRG) perfusion, to establish its normal values in patients without known peripheral nerve disorders or radicular pain syndromes and to determine the physiological spatial perfusion pattern within the DRG. Methods This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. 46 (24 female, 22 male, mean age 46.0 ± 15.2 years) subjects without known peripheral neuropathies or pain syndromes were examined by a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom VERIO or TRIO, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) with a VIBE (Volume-Interpolated-Breathhold-Examination) dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) T1-w-sequence (TR/TE 3.3/1.11 ms; 24 slices; voxel resolution 1.3 × 1.3 × 3.0 mm3) covered the pelvis from the upper plate of the 5th lumbar vertebra to the 2nd sacral vertebra. Transfer-constant (Ktrans) and interstitial-volume-fraction (interstitial-leakage-fraction, Ve) were modeled for the DRG and spinal nerve by applying the Tofts-model. Statistical analyses included pairwise comparisons of L5/S1 DRG vs. spinal nerve. Furthermore, distinct physiological zones within the S1 DRG were compared (cell body rich area (CBRA) vs. nerve fiber rich area (NFRA)). Results DRG showed a significantly increased permeability compared to spinal nerve (Ktrans 3.8 ± 1.5 10− 3/min vs. 1.6 ± 0.9 10− 3/min, p-value: &lt; 0.001) combined with an increased interstitial leakage of contrast agent into the extravascular-extracellular-space (Ve 38.1 ± 19.2% vs. 17.3 ± 9.9%, p-value: &lt; 0.001). Parameters showed no statistically significant difference on DRG-level (L5 vs. S1; p-value: 0.62 (Ktrans); 0.17 (Ve)) and -side (left vs. right; p-value: 0.25 (Ktrans); 0.79 (Ve)). Female gender was associated with a significantly increased permeability (Ktrans female 4.3 ± 1.4 10− 3/min vs. male 3.4 ± 0.9 10− 3/min, p-value: &lt; 0.05) but no statistically significant differences in interstitial leakage (Ve female 40.1 ± 14,1% vs. male 34.5 ± 17.4%, p-value: 0.24). DRG showed distinct spatial distribution patterns of perfusion: Ktrans and Ve were significantly higher in the CBRA than in the NFRA (Ktrans 4.4 ± 1.8 10− 3/min vs. 1.7 ± 1.2 10− 3/min, p-value: &lt; 0.001 and Ve 40.9 ± 21.3% vs. 15.1 ± 11.7%, p-value: &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Non-invasive and in-vivo measurement of human DRG perfusion by MRI is a feasible technique. DRG show substantially higher permeability and interstitial leakage than spinal nerves. Even distinct physiological perfusion patterns for different microstructural compartments could be observed within the DRG. The technique may become particularly useful for future research on the poorly understood human sensory neuropathies and pain syndromes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Peripheral nerve damage does not fully explain the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Central nervous system changes can follow trigeminal nerve dysfunction. We hypothesized that brain white matter and functional connectivity changes in TN patients were involved in pain perception, modulation, the cognitive-affective system, and motor function; moreover, changes in functional reorganization were correlated with white matter alterations. Twenty left TN patients and twenty-two healthy controls were studied. Diffusion kurtosis imaging was analyzed to extract diffusion and kurtosis parameters, and functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping was used to explore the functional reorganization in the brain. In the patient group, we found lower axial kurtosis and higher axial diffusivity in tracts participated in sensory, cognitive-affective, and modulatory aspects of pain, such as the corticospinal tract, superior longitudinal fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, cingulated gyrus, forceps major and uncinate fasciculus. Patients exhibited complex FCD reorganization of hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, precentral gyrus, precuneus, prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule in multiple modulatory networks that played crucial roles in pain perception, modulation, cognitive-affective system, and motor function. Further, the correlated structural-functional changes may be responsible for the persistence of long-term recurrent pain and sensory-related dysfunction in TN. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Background The PMP22 gene encodes a protein integral to peripheral myelin. Its deletion leads to hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). PMP22 is not expressed in the adult central nervous system, but previous studies suggest a role in CNS myelin development. The objective of this study was to identify potential structural and functional alterations in the afferent visual system in HNPP patients. Methods Twenty HNPP patients and 18 matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited in a crosssectional study. Participants underwent neurological examination including visual acuity, visual evoked potential (VEP) examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and magnetic resonance imaging with calculation of brain atrophy, regarding grey and white matter, and voxel based morphometry (VBM), in addition answered the National Eye Institute's 39-item Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ). Thirteen patients and 6 HC were additionally examined with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Results All patients had normal visual acuity, but reported reduced peripheral vision in comparison to HC in the NEI-VFQ (p = 0.036). VEP latency was prolonged in patients (P100 = 103.7±5.7 ms) in comparison to healthy subjects (P100 = 99.7±4.2 ms, p = 0.007). In OCT, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness RNFL was decreased in the nasal sector (90.0±15.5 vs. 101.8±16.5, p = 0.013), and lower nasal sector RNFL correlated with prolonged VEP latency (Rho = -0.405, p = 0.012). MRS revealed reduced tNAA (731.4±45.4 vs. 814.9 ±62.1, p = 0.017) and tCr (373.8±22.2 vs. 418.7±31.1, p = 0.002) in the visual cortex in patients vs. HC. Whole brain volume, grey and white matter volume, VBM and metabolites in a MRS sensory cortex control voxel did not differ significantly between patients and HC. Conclusion PMP22 deletion leads to functional, metabolic and macro-structural alterations in the afferent visual system of HNPP patients. Our data suggest a functional relevance of these changes for peripheral vision, which warrants further investigation and confirmation. © 2016 Brandt et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

AB  - The etiology of most childhood cancer remains largely unknown, but is likely attributable to random or induced genetic aberrations in somatic tissue. However, a subset of children develops cancer in the setting of an underlying inheritable condition involving a germline genetic mutation or chromosomal aberration. The term "neurocutaneous syndrome" encompasses a group of multisystem, hereditary disorders that are associated with skin manifestations as well as central and/or peripheral nervous system lesions of variable severity. This review outlines the central nervous system tumors associated with underlying neurocutaneous disorders, including neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, Von Hippel Lindau, and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Recognizing the presence of an underlying syndrome is critically important to both optimizing clinical care and treatment as well as genetic counseling and monitoring of these affected patients and their families. © SAGE Publications.

AB  - The aim of the study was to critically review the clinical approach to distinguish the sensory and motor nerve fascicles of the peripheral nerve system and to explore potential novel techniques to meet the clinical needs. The principles and shortcomings of the currently used methods for identification of sensory and motor nerve fascicles, including nerve morphology, electrical stimulation, spectroscopy, enzymohistochemistry staining (acetylcholinesterase [AchE], carbonic anhydrase [CA] and choline acetyltransferase [ChAC] histochemistry staining methods), and immunochemical staining were systematically reviewed. The progress in diffusion tensor imaging, proteomic approaches, and quantum dots (QDs) assessment in clinical applications to identify sensory or motor fascicles has been discussed. Traditional methods such as physical and enzymohistochemical methods are not suitable for the precise differentiation of sensory and motor nerve fascicles. Immunohistochemical staining using AchE, CA, and ChAC is promising in differentiation of sensory and motor nerve fascicles. Diffusion tensor imaging can reflect morphological details of nerve fibers. Proteomics can reveal the dynamics of specific proteins discriminating sensory and motor fascicles. QDs, with their size-dependent optical properties, make them the ideal protein markers for identification of the sensory or motor nerves. Diffusion tensor imaging, proteomics and QDs-imaging will facilitate the clinical identification of motor and sensory nerve fascicles, help in improving surgical success rates and assist in postoperative functional recovery. © 2016 Neurology India | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - SPG11 belongs to the autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) and presents during childhood or puberty with a complex clinical phenotype encompassing learning difficulties, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, and mental retardation. We hereby present the case of a 30-year-old female patient with complex autosomal recessive HSP with thinning of the corpus callosum (TCC) and dementia that was compound heterozygous with two novel mutations in the SPG11 gene. Sequence analysis of the SPG11 gene revealed two novel mutations in a compound heterozygous state in the index patient (c.2431C>T/p.Gln811Ter and c.6755-6756insT/p.Glu2252Aspfs∗88). MRI showed abnormal TCC, white matter (WM) hyperintensities periventricularly, and the 'ears of the lynx' sign. Diffusion tensor imaging showed a mild-to-moderate decrease in fractional anisotropy and an increase in mean diffusivity in WM compared to age-matched controls, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed abnormal findings in affected WM with a decrease in N-acetyl-aspartate in WM regions of interest. This is the first SPG11 kindred from the Greek population to be reported in the medical literature. © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Neurocutaneous syndromes encompasses a broad group of genetic disorders with different clinical, genetic, and pathologic features that share developmental lesions of the skin as well as central and peripheral nervous system. Cerebellar involvement has been shown in numerous types of neurocutaneous syndrome. It may help or be needed for the diagnosis and to explain the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of affected children. This article describes various types of neurocutaneous syndrome with cerebellar involvement. For each neurocutaneous disease or syndrome, clinical features, genetic, neuroimaging findings, and the potential role of the cerebellar involvement is discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Panoramical radiographs or cone-beam computed tomography (CT) are the standard-of-care in dental imaging to assess teeth, mandible, and mandibular canal pathologies, but do not allow assessment of the inferior alveolar nerve itself nor of its branches. We propose a new technique for “MR neurographic orthopantomograms” exploiting ultrashort echo-time (UTE) imaging of bone and teeth complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography. Materials and Methods: The Institutional Review Board approved the study in 10 healthy volunteers. Imaging of the subjects mandibles at 3.0T (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens-Healthcare) using a 64-channel head coil with isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar reformatting, was performed. Bone images were acquired using a 3D PETRA sequence (TE, 0.07 msec). Morphological nerve imaging was performed using a dedicated 3D PSIF and 3D SPACE STIR sequence. Functional MR neurography was accomplished using a new accelerated diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) prototype sequence (2D SMS-accelerated RESOLVE). Qualitative and quantitative image analysis was performed and descriptive statistics are provided. Results: Image acquisition and subsequent postprocessing into the MR neurographic orthopantomogram by overlay of morphological and functional images were feasible in all 10 volunteers without artifacts. All mandibular bones and mandibular nerves were assessable and considered normal. Fiber tractography with quantitative evaluation of physiological diffusion properties of mandibular nerves yielded the following mean ± SD values: fractional anisotropy, 0.43 ± 0.07; mean diffusivity (mm2/s), 0.0014 ± 0.0002; axial diffusivity, 0.0020 ± 0.0002, and radial diffusivity, 0.0011 ± 0.0001. Conclusion: The proposed technique of MR neurographic orthopantomogram exploiting UTE imaging complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography was feasible and allowed comprehensive assessment of osseous texture and neural microarchitecture in a single examination.

AB  - Objectives The aims of this preliminary study were to determine the number of axonal bundles (fascicles) in the median nerve,1 using a high-resolution, proton density (PD)-turbo spin echo (TSE) fat suppression sequence, and to determine normative T2 values, measured by triple-echo steady state, of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), at 7 T.2 Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted between March 2014 and January 2015. All study participants gave written informed consent. Six healthy volunteers (30 ± 12 years) and 5 patients with CTS (44 ± 16 years) were included. Measurements were performed on both wrists in all volunteers and on the affected wrist in patients (3 right, 2 left). Based on 5-point scales, 2 readers assessed image quality (1, very poor; 5, very good) and the presence of artifacts that might have a possible influence on fascicle determination (1, severe artifacts; 5, no artifacts) and counted the number of fascicles independently on the PD-TSE sequences. Furthermore, T2 values by region of interest analysis were assessed. Student t tests, a hierarchic linear model, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used for statistical analysis. Results: Proton density-TSE image quality and artifacts revealed a median of 5 in healthy volunteers and 4 in patients with CTS for both readers. Fascicle count of the median nerve ranged from 13 to 23 in all subjects, with an ICC of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.95). T2 values were significantly higher (P = 0.023) in patients (24.27 ± 0.97 milliseconds [95% CI, 22.19-26.38]) compared with healthy volunteers (21.01 ± 0.65 milliseconds [95% CI, 19.61-22.41]). The ICC for all T2 values was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98). Conclusions: This study shows the possibility of fascicle determination of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and patients with CTS (although probably less accurately) with high-resolution 7 T magnetic resonance imaging, as well as significantly higher T2 values in patients with CTS, which seems to be associated with pathophysiological nerve changes.

AB  - We report two cases of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in an uncommon location (heart and retropharynx) both with divergent osseous heterologous differentiation. We present the pathological and immunohistochemical studies that confirmed the neurogenic origin. The histopathology of the tumor arising in the retropharynx showed a transition from a neurofibroma to MPNST, making this a new report of an MPNST arising from a plexiform neurofibroma without neurofibromatosis. Primary cardiac MPNST with osseous differentiation has never been reported before. In conclusion, the histology of MPNSTs is very heterogeneous, showing no specific diagnostic immunoprofile or genetic alteration. Thus, it is important to rule out other histologically similar tumors, particularly in cases arising in uncommon locations or tumors with divergent heterologous differentiation. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Rationale and Objectives The aims of this study were to propose a semiautomated technique to segment and measure the volume of different nerve components of the tibial nerve, such as the nerve fascicles and the epineurium, based on magnetic resonance microneurography and a segmentation tool derived from brain imaging; and to assess the reliability of this method by measuring interobserver and intraobserver agreement. Materials and Methods The tibial nerve of 20 healthy volunteers (age range = 23–69; mean = 47; standard deviation = 15) was investigated at the ankle level. High-resolution images were obtained through tailored microneurographic sequences, covering 28 mm of nerve length. Two operators manually segmented the nerve using the in-phase image. This region of interest was used to mask the nerve in the water image, and two-class segmentation was performed to measure the fascicular volume, epineurial volume, nerve volume, and fascicular to nerve volume ratio (FNR). Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were calculated. Results The nerve structure was clearly visualized with distinction of the fascicles and the epineurium. Segmentation provided absolute volumes for nerve volume, fascicular volume, and epineurial volume. The mean FNR resulted in 0.69 with a standard deviation of 0.04 and appeared to be not correlated with age and sex. Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were excellent with alpha values >0.9 for each parameter investigated, with measurements free of systematic errors at the Bland-Altman analysis. Conclusions We concluded that the method is reproducible and the parameter FNR is a novel feature that may help in the diagnosis of neuropathies detecting changes in volume of the fascicles or the epineurium. © 2016 The Association of University Radiologists

AB  - Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown that fractional anisotropy (FA) is lower in peripheral nerves in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We examined whether DTI correlates to muscle strength or impairment. Methods: MRI of sciatic and tibial nerves was performed on 3-T MR scanner by obtaining T2- and DTI-weighted sequences with fat saturation. On each slice of T2-weighted (T2w) and DTI, the tibial and sciatic nerves were segmented and served for calculation of signal intensity. On DTI images, pixel-by-pixel calculation of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was done. Muscle strength at knee and ankle was determined by isokinetic dynamometry and severity of CIDP by neuropathy impairment score (NIS). Results: Fourteen CIDP patients treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin were compared to gender- and age-matched controls. T2w values expressed as a nerve/muscle ratio (nT2w) were unchanged in CIDP versus controls 0.93 ± 0.21 versus 1.02 ± 0.21 (P = 0.10). FA values were lower in CIDP compared to controls 0.38 ± 0.07 versus 0.45 ± 0.05 (P &lt; 0.0001), and ADC values were higher in CIDP versus controls 1735 ± 232 versus 1593 ± 116 × 10−6 mm2/s (P = 0.005). In CIDP, FA values correlated to clinical impairment (NIS) (r = −0.57, P = 0.03), but not to muscle strength. FA value in the sciatic nerve distinguishes CIDP from controls with a sensitivity and a specificity of 92.9 %. Conclusion: CIDP patients have unchanged nT2w values, lower FA values, and higher ADC values of sciatic and tibial nerves compared to controls. FA values correlated to NIS but were unrelated to muscle strength. DTI of sciatic nerves seems promising to differentiate CIDP from controls. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the quality of recently emerged advanced diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques with conventional single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) in a functional assessment of lumbar nerve roots. Materials and Methods: The institutional review board approved the study including 12 healthy volunteers. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed at 3 T (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare) with b-values of 0 and 700 s/mm2 and an isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar reformatting. The nerve roots L2 to S1 were imaged in coronal orientation with readout-segmented EPI (rs-DTI) and selective-excitation EPI (sTX-DTI) with an acquisition time of 5 minutes each, and in axial orientation with single-shot EPI (ss-DTI) with an acquisition time of 12 minutes (scan parameters as in recent literature). Two independent readers qualitatively and quantitatively assessed image quality. Results: The interobserver reliability ranged from "substantial" to "almost perfect" for all examined parameter and all 3 sequences (κ = 0.70-0.94). Overall image quality was rated higher, and artifact levels were scored lower for rs-DTI and sTX-DTI than for ss-DTI (P = 0.007-0.027), while fractional anisotropy and signal-to-noise ratio values were similar for all sequences (P ≥ 0.306 and P ≥ 0.100, respectively). Contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly higher for rs-DTI and ss-DTI than for sTX-DTI (P = 0.004-0.013). Conclusions: Despite shorter acquisition times, rs-DTI and sTX-DTI produced images of higher quality with smaller geometrical distortions than the current standard of reference, ss-DTI. Thus, DTI acquisitions in the coronal plane, requiring fewer slices for full coverage of exiting nerve roots, may allow for functional neurography in scan times suitable for routine clinical practice.

AB  - We report the development of a double diffusion encoding (DDE) MRI method to estimate and map the axon diameter distribution (ADD) within an imaging volume. A variety of biological processes, ranging from development to disease and trauma, may lead to changes in the ADD in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Unlike previously proposed methods, this ADD experimental design and estimation framework employs a more general, nonparametric approach, without a priori assumptions about the underlying form of the ADD, making it suitable to analyze abnormal tissue. In the current study, this framework was used on an ex vivo ferret spinal cord, while emphasizing the way in which the ADD can be weighted by either the number or the volume of the axons. The different weightings, which result in different spatial contrasts, were considered throughout this work. DDE data were analyzed to derive spatially resolved maps of average axon diameter, ADD variance, and extra-axonal volume fraction, along with a novel sub-micron restricted structures map. The morphological information contained in these maps was then used to segment white matter into distinct domains by using a proposed k-means clustering algorithm with spatial contiguity and left-right symmetry constraints, resulting in identifiable white matter tracks. The method was validated by comparing histological measures to the estimated ADDs using a quantitative similarity metric, resulting in good agreement. With further acquisition acceleration and experimental parameters adjustments, this ADD estimation framework could be first used preclinically, and eventually clinically, enabling a wide range of neuroimaging applications for improved understanding of neurodegenerative pathologies and assessing microstructural changes resulting from trauma. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: This study reports on a patient who developed degeneration of an injured spinothalamic tract (STT) detected on diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Case description: A 56-year-old female had suffered from head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident. The patient did not experience loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia and the patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. She had begun to feel pain in her left hand and foot at ~ 7 days after onset. The characteristics and severity of pain were as follows: constant tingling and pricking sensation without allodynia or hyperalgesia (Visual Analogue Scale score: 3~4). No specific focal lesion was observed on brain and spine MRI and an electromyography study showed no evidence of peripheral nerve injury or radiculopathy. At 6 months after onset, the central pain in the left hand and foot became aggravated, with a Visual Analogue Scale score of 6. Results: On 1-month DTT, partial tearing was observed in both STTs. In contrast, both partially torn STTs had become atrophy on 9-month DTT. Conclusions: This study recommends further studies conducted on the prognosis (regeneration or degeneration) of injured STTs and on the effect of change of an injured STT on central pain. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: While standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are increasingly employed in post-mortem (PM) examinations, more advanced techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) remain unexplored in forensic sciences. Therefore, we studied the temporal stability and reproducibility of DTI and fiber tractography (FT) in non-fixed PM subjects. In addition, we investigated the lumbosacral nerves with PMDTI and compared their tissue characteristics to in vivo findings. Methods: MRI data were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner in seven PM subjects, consisting of six non-trauma deaths and one chronic trauma death, and in six living subjects. Inter-scan (within one session) and inter-session (between days) reproducibility of diffusion parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD), were evaluated for the lumbosacral nerves using Bland-Altman and Jones plots. Diffusion parameters in nerves L3-S2 were compared to living subjects using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Reproducibility of diffusion values of inter-scan 95% limits of agreement ranged from -0.058 to 0.062 for FA, and (-0.037 to 0.052) × 10-3 mm2/s for MD. For the inter-session this was -0.0423 to 0.0423, and (-0.0442 to 0.0442) × 10-3 mm2/s for FA, and MD, respectively. Although PM subjects showed approximately four-fold lower diffusivity values compared to living subjects, FT results were comparable. The chronic trauma case showed disorganization and asymmetry of the nerves. Conclusion: We demonstrated that DTI was reproducible in characterizing nervous tissue properties and FT in reconstructing the architecture of lumbosacral nerves in PM subjects. We showed differences in diffusion values between PM and in vivo and showed the ability of PMDTI and FT to reconstruct nerve lesions in a chronic trauma case. We expect that PMDTI and FT may become valuable in identification and documentation of PM nerve trauma or pathologies in forensic sciences. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 measurements in the evaluation of radiation-induced peripheral nerve injury (RIPNI). Materials and Methods RIPNI was produced in a randomly selected side of sciatic nerve in each of 21 rabbits while the contralateral side served as the control. The limb function and MR parameters were evaluated over a 4-month period. Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (λâ), radial diffusivity (λâ) and T2 values were obtained using 3T MR for quantitative analysis. Two animals were randomly killed for histological evaluation at each timepoint. Results The T2 value of irradiated nerve increased at 1 day (63.95 ± 15.60, P = 0.012) and was restored at 1 month (52.34 ± 5.38, P = 0.105). It increased progressively at 2 to 4 months (60.39 ± 10.60, 66.96 ± 6.08, 75.51 ± 7.39, all P &lt; 0.01). λâ significantly increased at 1 day (0.82 ± 0.44, P = 0.046) and slightly decreased at 1 month (0.61 ± 0.17, P &lt; 0.001). It increased gradually from 2 to 3 months (0.84 ± 0.29, 1.13 ± 0.33, both P &lt; 0.001) followed by a decline at 4 months (0.83 ± 0.17, P &lt; 0.001). FA was statistically lower than the contralateral sides at 1 to 4 months (0.72 ± 0.08, 0.60 ± 0.12, 0.51 ± 0.11, 0.62 ± 0.06, all P &lt; 0.01). Changes in FA and λâ correlated well with the functional and pathological changes in irradiated nerve. Conclusion DTI may be a more sensitive and accurate method to evaluate RIPNI compared with T2 measurements. FA and λâ are promising quantitative indices in monitoring RIPNI. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Paresthesia-dominant and pain-dominant subgroups have been noted in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a peripheral neuropathic disorder characterized by altered primary somatosensory/motor (S1/M1) physiology. We aimed to investigate whether brain morphometry dissociates these subgroups. Subjects with CTS were evaluated with nerve conduction studies, whereas symptom severity ratings were used to allocate subjects into paresthesia-dominant (CTS-paresthesia), pain-dominant (CTS-pain), and pain/paresthesia nondominant (not included in further analysis) subgroups. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at 3T using a multiecho MPRAGE T1-weighted pulse sequence, and gray matter cortical thickness was calculated across the entire brain using validated, automated methods. CTS-paresthesia subjects demonstrated reduced median sensory nerve conduction velocity (P 0.05) compared with CTS-pain subjects. In addition, cortical thickness in precentral and postcentral gyri (S1/M1 hand area) contralateral to the more affected hand was significantly reduced in CTS-paresthesia subgroup compared with CTS-pain subgroup. Moreover, in CTS-paresthesia subjects, precentral cortical thickness was negatively correlated with paresthesia severity (r(34) -0.40, P 0.016) and positively correlated with median nerve sensory velocity (r(36) 0.51, P 0.001), but not with pain severity. Conversely, in CTS-pain subjects, contralesional S1 (r(9) 0.62, P 0.042) and M1 (r(9) 0.61, P 0.046) cortical thickness were correlated with pain severity, but not median nerve velocity or paresthesia severity. This double dissociation in somatotopically specific S1/M1 areas suggests a neuroanatomical substrate for symptom-based CTS subgroups. Such fine-grained subgrouping of CTS may lead to improved personalized therapeutic approaches, based on superior characterization of the linkage between peripheral and central neuroplasticity. © 2016 International Association for the Study of Pain.

AB  - Often complementary to clinical assessment, imaging of the brachial and lumbosacral plexus can be used to characterize plexus involvement by primary neoplasm, metastases, or conditions related to treatment. The imaging modality of choice, magnetic resonance (MR) without and with contrast, typically includes T1-weighted and fat-suppressed T2-weighted images. MR can delineate primary plexus neoplasms, including benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and accurately characterizes the extent of plexus involvement due to infiltrative malignancy. In cases in which there is clinical uncertainty between recurrent tumor and radiation injury, MR has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography has also been shown to be useful in excluding recurrent tumor. MR imaging techniques that have been more recently investigated in plexus imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging, isotropic three-dimensional imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and fiber tractography, show potential to further complement clinical evaluation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - The management of traumatic peripheral nerve injury remains a considerable concern for clinicians. With minimal innovations in surgical technique and a limited number of specialists trained to treat peripheral nerve injury, outcomes of surgical intervention have been unpredictable. The inability to manipulate the pathophysiology of nerve injury (i.e., Wallerian degeneration) has left scientists and clinicians depending on the slow and lengthy process of axonal regeneration (~1 mm/day). When axons are severed, the endings undergo calcium-mediated plasmalemmal sealing, which limits the ability of the axon to be primarily repaired. Polythethylene glycol (PEG) in combination with a bioengineered process overcomes the inability to fuse axons. The mechanism for PEG axonal fusion is not clearly understood, but multiple studies have shown that a providing a calcium-free environment is essential to the process known as PEG fusion. The proposed mechanism is PEG-induced lipid bilayer fusion by removing the hydration barrier surrounding the axolemma and reducing the activation energy required for membrane fusion to occur. This review highlights PEG fusion, its past and current studies, and future directions in PEG fusion. © 2016, Editorial Board of Neural Regeneration Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Brachial plexus injury (BPI) is a serious peripheral nerve injury, and clinical outcomes are generally unsatisfactory. It has been reported that cortical plasticity could influence the restoration of motor function. However, the neurologic mechanism of BPI is unclear, which provides a basis for further investigation. The supplementary motor area (SMA) plays an important role in the regulation of motor function. This study aims to explore SMA-whole brain functional connectivity after deafferentation of the brachial plexus. Methods Study subjects included 16 patients with BPI and 8 healthy volunteers. The seed region was defined by a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging program that used unilateral imaginary hand grasp motion as a task stimulus. Next, the voxel-wise functional connectivity between the predefined region and the other regions of the brain was calculated. Results We discovered decreased voxel-wise functional connectivity between the SMA and multiple brain regions, including precuneus, posterior cingulum cortex, and anterior cingulum cortex, that are closely associated with information integration or motor processing in patients with BPI. Conclusions Patients with BPI showed weakened functional connectivity between hand grasp-related areas and the SMA and multiple regions associated with motor processing or information integration. A clear image of the functional status of the brain after deafferentation was provided. On the basis of this discovery, a relationship between changes in neuroimaging measurements and clinical outcomes can be determined in future studies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose To determine the reliability and reproducibility of peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in healthy subjects. Materials and Methods We assessed the test-retest and interrater reliability studies of peripheral nerve DTI in a cohort of 12 healthy subjects (mean age 44.0 years, range 26-71 years). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed on a 3T scanner (MR750, GE Healthcare). DTI and T1-weighted sequences were performed on the tibial and peroneal nerves in the knee. Each subject was scanned on three separate occasions. Image analyses were performed at two anatomic positions: the level of the lateral femoral condyle (position 1), and the superior pole of the patella (position 2). Analysis was performed using three software packages ("raters"): FuncTools, FSL, and Diffusion Toolkit. Metrics obtained included fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Results DTI metrics were not significantly different between each measurement position, except peroneal nerve AD and tibial nerve RD were higher at position 1 (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). There was no significant difference in DTI metrics between male and female subjects (P = 0.10-0.99). The test-retest reliability of DTI metrics was high, maximal for FA (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96). ICC values for individual DTI metrics were similar between each measurement position, except that tibial nerve AD was significantly higher at position 2 (P = 0.03). Interrater reliability was also high (ICC = 0.95-0.96). Conclusion We found peripheral nerve DTI to be reliable and reproducible, with few effects related to the postprocessing package used. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: After successful utilization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting brain pathologies, it is now being examined for use in the detection of peripheral neuropathies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic potentials of DTI in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Material/Methods: The literature search was performed in multiple electronic databases using a keyword search and final selection of the studies was based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We performed a meta-analyses of mean differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between CTS patient and healthy subjects. Publication bias detection was done with Begg’s test and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the source/s of higher heterogeneity and the authenticity of results. Results: FA was significantly lower in CTS patients in comparison with healthy subjects (mean and the difference [95% confidence interval] was –0.06 [–0.10, –0.02] (p=0.003). The ADC was significantly higher in CTS patients (mean difference [95% CI] was 0.10 [0.02, 0.18], p=0.02). Overall sensitivity of FA-based diagnosis was 82.82%, with 77.83% specificity. Conclusions: DTI can be a valuable tool in diagnosing CTS. © Med Sci Monit, 2016.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the longitudinal relationship between chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms (sx) and brain perfusion changes in patients with breast cancer. Interaction of CIPN-sx perfusion effects with known chemotherapy-associated gray matter density decrease was also assessed to elucidate the relationship between CIPN and previously reported cancer treatment-related brain structural changes. Methods: Patients with breast cancer treated with (n=24) or without (n=23) chemotherapy underwent clinical examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging at the following three time points: before treatment (baseline), 1 month after treatment completion, and 1 year after the 1-month assessment. CIPN-sx were evaluated with the self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity four-item sensory-specific scale. Perfusion and gray matter density were assessed using voxel-based pulsed arterial spin labeling and morphometric analyses and tested for association with CIPN-sx in the patients who received chemotherapy. Results: Patients who received chemotherapy reported significantly increased CIPN-sx from baseline to 1 month, with partial recovery by 1 year (P <.001). CIPN-sx increase from baseline to 1 month was significantly greater for patients who received chemotherapy compared with those who did not (P=-.001). At 1 month, neuroimaging showed that for the group that received chemotherapy, CIPN-sx were positively associated with cerebral perfusion in the right superior frontal gyrus and cingulate gyrus, regions associated with pain processing (P<.001). Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging analysis in the group receiving chemotherapy indicated that CIPN-sx and associated perfusion changes from baseline to 1 month were also positively correlated with gray matter density change (P <.005). Conclusion: Peripheral neuropathy symptoms after systemic chemotherapy for breast cancer are associated with changes in cerebral perfusion and gray matter. The specific mechanisms warrant further investigation given the potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications. © 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ultrasonography (US) is commonly used to assess the peripheral nerves of the lower extremity because of its many advantages over magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The most obvious advantages over MR imaging are superior soft-tissue resolution, low cost, portability, lack of magnetic susceptibility artifact, and the ability to image patients who cannot undergo MR imaging. US has been shown to have equal specificity and greater sensitivity than MR imaging in the evaluation of peripheral nerves. Additional benefits are the capability of real-time and dynamic imaging, and the ability to scan an entire extremity quickly without the need for a patient to lie motionless for long periods of time, as with MR imaging. Any abnormal findings can be easily compared against the contralateral side. Published literature has shown that US has clinical utility in patients suspected of having peripheral nerve disease: US can be used to guide diagnostic and therapeutic decisions, as well as help confirm electrodiagnostic findings. Common indications for lower extremity peripheral nerve US are the evaluation for injury due to penetrating trauma, entrapment by scar tissue, or tumor. To confidently perform US of the peripheral nerves of the lower extremity, it is important to gain a thorough knowledge of anatomic landmarks and the course of each nerve. Readers who may not be familiar with US will be introduced to the basics of scanning the peripheral nerves of the lower extremity. Important anatomic landmarks and common sites of injury and entrapment will be reviewed. © RSNA, 2016.

AB  - Purpose To study diffusion-prepared neurography optimized for a large field-of-view (FOV) to include the neck and both shoulders. In a large FOV poor homogeneity of the magnetic field (B0) often leads to poor image quality and possibly to poor diagnostic accuracy. The aim was therefore to find an optimal (combination of) shimming method(s) for diffusion-prepared neurography in a large FOV. Materials and Methods A 3D diffusion-prepared sequence with a large FOV was tested with and without the use of a susceptibility-matched pillow combined with image-based (IB) or standard shimming in six healthy volunteers on a 3T system. B0, B1, signal to noise ratio (SNR), and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) were compared between all protocols. Additionally, nerve visibility, fat suppression, artifacts, and overall image quality were ordinally (5-point scale) assessed by two readers. Furthermore, correlations between B0 and B1 (offset and variation) and SNR, CNR, and image quality were explored. Results The use of the susceptibility-matched pillow led to a 43% reduction of B0 variation over the brachial plexus compared to the situation without a pillow (P &lt; 0.05). The combination of the pillow with IB-shimming and the optimized diffusion-prepared sequence resulted in good nerve visibility, good fat suppression, no artifacts that would hinder clinical diagnosis, and a good overall quality (median scores ≥4). Reducing B0 variation was associated with SNR, CNR, and the above-mentioned scored features (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion The use of a susceptibility-matched pillow in combination with IB-shimming enables robust and high-quality neurography of the complete brachial plexus. J. MAGN. RESON.

AB  - A 25-year-old man developed a growing neck mass, and percutaneous biopsy yielded diagnosis of schwannoma. The patient underwent magnetic resonance (MR) neurography, including diffusion tensor imaging performed with RESOLVE at 3 tesla (Skyra; Siemens, Malvern, PA). Postprocessing and 3-dimensional tractography were performed in DSI studio (dsi-studio.labsolver.org). 1 MR neurography confirmed a mass arising from the right C4 nerve (figure, A). Tractography localized a potential window for surgical approach in the surrounding nerve fibers (figure, B and C). Intraoperative electrophysiologic mapping and microscopy findings (figure, D-F) precisely confirmed the imaging findings. Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography may be valuable in the preoperative workup of peripheral nerve tumors. 2,3 © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Peripheral nerve trauma frequently affects younger people and may result in significant and long-lasting functional disability. Currently, diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral nerve injury relies on clinical and electrodiagnostic information, supplemented by intraoperative electrophysiological studies. However, in a significant proportion of nerve injuries, the likelihood of spontaneous regeneration resulting in good functional outcome remains uncertain and unnecessary delays to treatment may be faced while monitoring for recovery. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques to diagnose and monitor nerve injury and regeneration are being developed, and have the potential to streamline the decision-making process. In addition, advances in operative and non-operative treatment strategies may provide more effective ways to maximise functional outcomes following severe peripheral nerve trauma. This review discusses these advances in light of the current state of the art of management of peripheral nerve trauma.

AB  - Constitutional 11q interstitial deletion syndrome presents with congenital anomalies including microcephaly with craniostenosis, minor dysmorphic features, vitreoretinopathy, and renal anomalies. This syndrome is occasionally associated with neuroblastoma (NB) as a life-threatening complication, which is important for clinical care. Although the corresponding locus to NB has been predicted to exist in 11q22-23 by previous deletion studies related to NB, the causative haploinsufficient genes have not yet been identified. We herein reported for the first time the simultaneous coexistence of adrenal NB and abdominal prevertebral ganglioneuroma in a 6-year-old girl with a constitutional hemizygous 11q14.1-23.3 deletion. Of the 11 haploinsufficient genes predicted with an in silico database, we focused on NCAM1 and CADM1 as the genes accountable for NB and ganglioneuroma. The deletion range, especially the 11q22.3 involvement, needs to be determined in 11q deletion cases in order to predict susceptibility to peripheral nerve tumors involving NB and ganglioneuroma. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that occur commonly in individuals with neurocutaneous disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1. Vagal nerve neurofibromas, however, are a relatively rare occurrence.We present the case of a 22-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with a neurofibroma of the left cervical vagal nerve. The mass was resected through an anterior approach without major event. In the postoperative course, the patient developed left vocal cord paralysis treated with medialization with injectable gel. We then present a comprehensive review of the literature for surgical resection of vagal nerve neurofibromas. © 2016 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

AB  - Objectives: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can provide structural information and objective values for nerves. The aims of this study were to perform quantitative evaluation and fibre tracking of the normal inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) using DTI on 3.0-T MRI. Methods: DTI was applied to 92 IANs of 46 healthy volunteers. Circular regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on three different positions at the mandibular foramen, second molar and mental foramen of each nerve on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and the ADC and FA of each ROI were measured. Differences in the values arising from the nerve positions were evaluated. Furthermore, fibre tracking of the IANs was performed by tractography, and the quality of visualization was evaluated. Results: There were no significant differences in the ADC and FA between the right and left sides regardless of the anteroposterior positions. Regarding differences arising from the anteroposterior measurement positions, the ADC and FA showed no significant differences (p > 0.017), except for the ADCs between the positions at the mandibular foramen and mental foramen in the left side (p = 0.0068). Overall, 70 (76%) of the 92 IANs could be visualized fully or partially by tractography. Conclusions: The ADC and FA of the IAN were successfully obtained from healthy volunteers using DTI and were confirmed to be symmetrical regardless of the measurement positions. DTI is a feasible technique for the quantitative evaluation and visualization of the IAN. © 2016 The Authors. Published by the British Institute of Radiology.

AB  - To investigate the microstructural changes in compressed nerves using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of herniated disc treated with percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy. Diffusion tensor imaging has been widely used to visualize peripheral nerves, and the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed using DTI. However, the microstructural changes after surgery are not well-understood in patients with lumbar disc herniation. Thirty-four consecutive patients with foraminal disc herniation affecting unilateral sacral 1 (S1) nerve roots were enrolled in this study. DTI with tractography was performed on S1 nerve roots before and after surgery. The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient values were calculated from tractography images. In compressed nerve roots, the FA value before surgery was significantly lower than that after surgery (P=0.000). A significant difference in FA values was found between the compressed and normal sides before surgery (P=0.000). However, no significant difference was found between the compressed and normal sides after surgery (P=0.057). A significant difference in apparent diffusion coefficient values was found before and after surgery at the compressed side (P=0.023). However, no significant difference was found between the compressed and normal sides after surgery (P=0.203). We show that the diffusion parameters of compressed nerve roots were not significantly different before and after percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy, indicating that the microstructure of the nerve root recovered after surgery. © 2016 the Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the clinical setting as a complementary tool to conventional MRI in the study and assessment of the sciatic nerve and its pathologies. Methods: 17 patients diagnosed with different types of sciatic neuropathy and 10 healthy controls underwent a conventional MRI and a DTI study in a 3-T MR scanner (Achieva 3-T X-Series; Philips Healthcare, Netherlands). Results: In the control group, we were able to track and visualize the common sciatic nerve and its main branches from hip to foot. In the patient group, the affected sciatic nerves presented statistically significant lower fractional anisotropy values and higher apparent diffusion coefficient values when compared with controls, suggesting nerve damage. In all cases, DTI offered complementary information for diagnosis and/or confirmation of the suspected pathology. When compared with conventional MRI, DTI showed higher sensitivity for nerve damage detection. Conclusion: DTI offers a significant improvement and an important complement to visualize the sciatic nerve and its main branches. In patients with sciatic nerve pathology DTI allows to a better detection and characterization of the nerve damage. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Acute conditions involving the spine and spinal cord in the pediatric age group are rare but potentially devastating and result from several etiopathogenetic mechanisms. Patients may present with a combination of back pain and acute neurological deterioration. Neuroimaging studies, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), play a pivotal role in the management of affected patients, while computerized tomography (CT) plays a secondary role in some conditions. Trauma to the pediatric spine has different pathomechanisms than in adults due to the peculiar state of incomplete ossification of the spine; thus, ligamentous injuries and involvement of the cervical spine prevail. Normal variants such as C2-C3 pseudosubluxation render radiographic evaluation more challenging in children, and radiologists must be familiar with them. Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) is associated with more complete neurologic injuries than in cases where the injuries can be seen on X-rays. Musculoskeletal causes other than trauma may present with acute back pain that prompts clinical evaluation, including spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis, muscle strain, and disc herniation. Infectious/inflammatory conditions involving the pediatric spine are manifold; in general terms, inflammation is more frequent than infection. Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) presents with an acute onset of motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction and can be idiopathic or occur in the context of autoimmune conditions such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis, and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). MRI shows normal or slightly expanded spinal cord with diffuse or patchy hyperintensity on T2-weighted images involving more than three to four vertebral levels in length and more than 2/3 of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord. Spinal cord ischemia enters the differential diagnosis with ATM and may be indistinguishable on MRI; however, its clinical presentation is typically hyperacute and stroke-like. The Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute inflammatory disorder involving the spinal and peripheral nerves; patients experience acute onset of lower extremity weakness, progressing to flaccid paralysis and possibly ascending to involve the upper limbs, diaphragm, and cranial nerves. MRI shows contrast enhancement of the affected nerve roots, typically at the level of the cauda equina. Spinal infection is rare in the absence of predisposing conditions, such as immune suppression; spinal cord abscess can be seen in patients harboring dermal sinus tracts, which allow skin bacteria to colonize the central nervous system. Spinal cord tumors may present acutely, either because they compress the spinal cord (extradural/intradural extramedullary tumors) or because they primarily infiltrate the spinal cord, causing neurological deterioration and pain. Acute pain is a characteristic of several spinal tumors, prominently including osteoid osteomas which tend to give nocturnal pain that recedes with salicylates. In conclusion, the differences between children and adults with acute spinal conditions are significant; thus, children with acute spinal presentation require tailored neuroimaging studies and management. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Objective: Epineural scar formation is one of the most significant negative factors affecting surgical repair after peripheral nerve injury. The scar tissue mechanically hinders axonal regeneration and causes adhesions between nerves and surrounding tissues. A hemostatic agent Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS; I˙mmun Gida I˙laç Kozmetik San. ve Tic. Ltd. Sti., Istanbul, Turkey) has not been previously used. Decreasing the postoperative bleeding and adhesions between nerve and surrounding tissues will prevent the formation of scar tissue, as well as corresponding compressive neuropathy and/or deceleration of axonal regeneration. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the effects of bleeding on nerve healing and scar tissue after repair of peripheral nerve injuries. Methods: The right sciatic nerve of 30 Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 260-330 g) was cut 1.5 cm proximal to the trifurcation and repaired primarily with 8/0 sutures using epineural technique. The rats were then divided into 3 groups. Saline was applied in Group 1 (n=10), ABS in Group 2 (n=10), and heparin in Group 3 (n=10) for 5 minutes to the repair site and surrounding tissues. In each group, electrophysiological measurements were performed with electromyography (EMG) at postoperative week 12. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used at week 12. Macroscopical and histopathological evaluations were conducted after sacrificing the rats at week 24 with total excision of the repaired sciatic nerves and surrounding tissues. Results: The ABS and saline groups showed better healing than the heparin group. The ABS and saline groups were better in the histopathologic evaluations, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Statistically significant differences were not found between the 3 groups. Significant results may be obtained with larger studies. © 2016 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.

AB  - Introduction: Spinal cord and peripheral nerves are classically known to be damaged in Friedreich's ataxia, but the extent of cerebral involvement in the disease and its progression over time are not yet characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate longitudinally cerebral damage in Friedreich's ataxia Methods: We enrolled 31 patients and 40 controls, which were evaluated at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. To assess gray matter, we employed voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness measurements. White matter was evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging. Statistical analyses were both cross-sectional and longitudinal (corrected for multiple comparisons). Results: Group comparison between patients and controls revealed widespread macrostructural differences at baseline: gray matter atrophy in the dentate nuclei, brainstem, and precentral gyri; and white matter atrophy in the cerebellum and superior cerebellar peduncles, brainstem, and periventricular areas. We did not identify any longitudinal volumetric change over time. There were extensive microstructural alterations, including superior cerebellar peduncles, corpus callosum, and pyramidal tracts. Longitudinal analyses identified progressive microstructural abnormalities at the corpus callosum, pyramidal tracts, and superior cerebellar peduncles after 1 year of follow-up. Conclusion: Patients with Friedreich's ataxia present more widespread gray and white matter damage than previously reported, including not only infratentorial areas, but also supratentorial structures. Furthermore, patients with Friedreich's ataxia have progressive microstructural abnormalities amenable to detection in a short-term follow-up. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - Brachial plexus injury (BPI) causes functional changes in the brain, but the structural changes resulting from BPI remain unknown. In this study, we compared grey matter volume between nine BPI patients and ten healthy controls by means of voxel-based morphometry. This was the first study of cortical morphology in BPI. We found that brain regions including the cerebellum, anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral inferior, medial, superior frontal lobe, and bilateral insula had less grey matter in BPI patients. Most of the affected brain regions of BPI patients are closely related to motor function. We speculate that the loss of grey matter in multiple regions might be the neural basis of the difficulties in the motor rehabilitation of BPI patients. The mapping result might provide new target regions for interventions of motor rehabilitation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Italia.

AB  - The goals of this study were (1) to provide accessible and instructive browsing software for sectioned images and a portable document format (PDF) file that includes three-dimensional (3D) models of an entire dog body and (2) to develop techniques for segmentation and 3D modeling that would enable an investigator to perform these tasks without the aid of a computer engineer. To achieve these goals, relatively important or large structures in the sectioned images were outlined to generate segmented images. The sectioned and segmented images were then packaged into browsing software. In this software, structures in the sectioned images are shown in detail and in real color. After 3D models were made from the segmented images, the 3D models were exported into a PDF file. In this format, the 3D models could be manipulated freely. The browsing software and PDF file are available for study by students, for lecture for teachers, and for training for clinicians. These files will be helpful for anatomical study by and clinical training of veterinary students and clinicians. Furthermore, these techniques will be useful for researchers who study two-dimensional images and 3D models. Anat Rec, 299:81-87, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Peripheral nerves at the elbow region are prone to entrapment neuropathies and injuries. To make accurate assessment, clinicians need stereoscopic display of the nerves to observe them at all angles. Objectives: To obtain a stereoscopic display of the peripheral nerves at the elbow region based on magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using three post-processing methods of volume rendering (VR), maximum intensity projection (MIP), and fiber tractography, and to evaluate the difference and correlation between them. Subjects and Methods: Twenty-four elbows of 12 healthy young volunteers were assessed by 20 encoding diffusion direction MR DTI scans. Images belonging to a single direction (anterior-posterior direction, perpendicular to the nerve) were subjected to VR and MIP reconstruction. All raw DTI data were transferred to the Siemens MR workstation for fiber tractography post-processing. Imaging qualities of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were evaluated by two observers independently based on a custom evaluation scale. Results: Stereoscopic displays of the nerves were obtained in all 24 elbows by VR, MIP, and fiber tractography post-processing methods. The VR/MIP post-processing methods were easier to perform compared to fiber tractography. There was no significant difference among the scores of fiber tracking and VR/MIP reconstruction for single direction. The imaging quality scores of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were significantly correlated based on intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis (ICC ranged 0.709 - 0.901), which suggested that the scores based on fiber tractography and VR/MIP for the same sample were consistent. Inter- and intraobserver agreements were good to excellent. Conclusion: Stereoscopic displays of the peripheral nerves at the elbow region can be achieved by using VR, MIP, and fiber tracking post-processing methods based on raw DTI images. VR and MIP reconstruction could be used as preview tools before fiber tracking to determine whether the raw images are satisfactory. © 2016, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Iranian Society of Radiology.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurogenetic disorder. Individuals with NF1 may develop a variety of benign and malignant tumors of which peripheral nerve sheath tumors represent the most frequent entity. Plexiform neurofibromas may demonstrate a locally destructive growth pattern, may cause severe symptoms and may undergo malignant transformation into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the reference standard for detection of soft tissue tumors in NF1. It allows for identification of individuals with plexiform neurofibromas, for assessment of local tumor extent, and for evaluation of whole-body tumor burden on T2-weighted imaging. Multiparametric MRI may provide a comprehensive characterization of different tissue properties of peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and may identify parameters associated with malignant transformation. Due to the absence of any radiation exposure, whole-body MRI may be used for serial follow-up of individuals with plexiform neurofibromas. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission-tomography (FDG PET/CT) allows a highly sensitive and specific detection of MPNST, and should be used in case of potential malignant transformation of a peripheral nerve sheath tumor. PET/CT provides a sensitive whole-body tumor staging. The use of contrast-enhanced CT for diagnosis of peripheral nerve sheath tumors is limited to special indications. To obtain the most precise readings, optimized examination protocols and dedicated radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians familiar with the complex and variable morphologies of peripheral nerve sheath tumors are required. © 2015 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

AB  - Introduction We investigated the applicability of nerve ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Methods We systematically examined several nerves with ultrasound and the lumbar roots and tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa of nine CIDP patients with MRI additionally to the nerve conduction studies. Results Patients with overall disability sum score (ODSS) 2-3 were characterised by normal fascicular structure in MRI and ultrasound. Patients with higher ODSS showed isolated enlarged fascicles and increased cross sectional area (CSA) of the peripheral nerves and of the diameter of the cauda equina and L5 root, whereas two of them showed atrophic fascicles in both imaging techniques. Conclusions Nerve ultrasound and MRI findings show the same morphological fascicle alterations in peripheral nerves in correlation to ODSS. Nerve ultrasound as an affordable tool, easy and quick to perform, could replace MRI in daily routine for monitoring peripheral nerve morphology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Prevention of Phrenic Injury Using Imaging Introduction Phrenic nerve (PN) injury is one of the major complications of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Pace mapping for PN capture is routinely used to identify areas with high risk for injury along the anterior border of the right pulmonary veins (PVs). Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility of using preprocedural imaging to identify areas where no PN capture is possible along the anterior border of the right PVs, thus avoiding the need for pace mapping during PVI. Methods and Results It was hypothesized that PN capture along the anterior border of the right PVs does not occur in the area where the right and left atria overlap. Three-dimensional segmentation of both atria was performed on preprocedural magnetic resonance and computed tomography angiograms in 40 patients before undergoing PVI. The area of overlap between the right and left atria was delineated. Image registration was performed during the procedure. Using pacing, regions with and without PN capture were marked along the anterior border of the right PVs. A total of 361 points were tested for PN stimulation (9 ± 4 points/patient). PN capture occurred in 97 out of the 189 points (51%) in the area with no overlap between the right and left atria. No PN capture occurred in the area of overlap (172 points, P< 0.001). Conclusion Delineation of the area of overlap between the right and left atria derived from preprocedural imaging reliably identifies regions where PN pace capture does not occur. Testing for PN stimulation before ablation may not be necessary in these regions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The phakomatoses are disorders characterized by multiple hamartomas and other congenital malformations affecting mainly the skin and the central and peripheral nervous systems. Many affected individuals have an increased genetic susceptibility to develop malignancies. Imaging is central in the diagnosis of many of the phakomatoses, and MRI is used as a screening tool in many children with known neurocutaneous disorders. This manuscript addresses the three most common (neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberous sclerosis complex, Sturge–Weber syndrome) and focuses on pathophysiological and radiologic insights that have emerged in the last few years. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Tractography (or fiber tracking) consists of three-dimensional modeling of the preferential movement of water molecules in the form of fiber tracks from the tensor field information. This technique allows a new approach for the microarchitectural analysis of anisotropic structures such as nerves, white matter, and muscles. Many disorders have been studied including cervical myelopathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, nerve root compression, and nerve tumors. Muscles have been less evaluated. Tractography is still a research technique, and its validation and widespread routine clinical use will require a good deal of work toward a harmonization of the MRI protocols and data postprocessing methods.

AB  - We evaluated safety and feasibility of high-pressure transvenous limb perfusion in an upper extremity of adult patients with muscular dystrophy, after completing a similar study in a lower extremity. A dose escalation study of single-limb perfusion with 0.9% saline was carried out in nine adults with muscular dystrophies under intravenous analgesia. Our study demonstrates that it is feasible and definitely safe to perform high-pressure transvenous perfusion with 0.9% saline up to 35% of limb volume in the upper extremities of young adults with muscular dystrophy. Perfusion at 40% limb volume is associated with short-lived physiological changes in peripheral nerves without clinical correlates in one subject. This study provides the basis for a phase 1/2 clinical trial using pressurized transvenous delivery into upper limbs of nonambulatory patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, our results are applicable to other conditions such as limb girdle muscular dystrophy as a method for delivering regional macromolecular therapeutics in high dose to skeletal muscles of the upper extremity. © 2015 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Background: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are widely used in the evaluation of the central nervous system and recently have been reported as a potential tool for diagnosis of the peripheral nerve or the lumbar nerve entrapment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate consecutive changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of normal lumbar nerve roots from the junction of the dura mater. Methods: The lumbar spinal nerves were examined in 6 male healthy volunteers (mean age, 35 years) with no experiences of sciatica, with a 3.0-T MR unit using a five-element phased-array surface coil. DTI was performed with the following imaging parameters: 11084.6/73.7 ms for TR/TE; b-value, 800 s/mm2; MPG, 33 directions; slice thickness, 1.5 mm; and total scan time, 7 min 35 s. ADC and FA values at all consecutive points along the L4, L5 and S1 nerves were quantified on every 1.5 mm slice from the junction of the dura mater using short fiber tracking. Results: ADC values of all L4, 5, and S1 nerve roots decreased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction and was constant distally afterward. ADC values in the proximal portion demonstrated S1 > L5 > L4 (p < 0.05). On the other hand, FA values increased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction, and was constant distally afterward. FA values in the proximal portion showed L4 > L5 > S1 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that ADC and FA values of each L4, 5, and S1 at the proximal portion from the junction of the dura matter changed linearly. It would be useful to know the normal profile of DTI values by location of each nerve root so that we can detect subtle abnormalities in each nerve root. © 2015 Miyagi et al.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters as in-vivo biomarkers of axon and myelin sheath integrity of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. Methods: MRI examinations at 3T including DTI were conducted on wrists in 30 healthy subjects. After manual segmentation of the median nerve quantitative analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as axial, radial and mean diffusivity (AD, RD, and MD) was carried out. Pairwise Pearson correlations with electrophysiological parameters comprising sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) as markers of axon integrity, and distal motor latency (dml) and sensory nerve conduction velocity (sNCV) as markers of myelin sheath integrity were computed. The significance criterion was set at P=0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. Results: DTI parameters showed a distinct proximal-to-distal profile with FA, MD, and RD extrema coinciding in the center of the carpal tunnel. AD correlated with CMAP (r=0.50, p=0.04, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of myelin sheath integrity. RD correlated with sNCV (r=-0.53, p=0.02, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of axon integrity. FA correlated with dml (r=-0.63, p=0.002, Bonf. corr.) and sNCV (r=0.68, p=0.001, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of axon integrity. Conclusion: AD reflects axon integrity, while RD (and FA) reflect myelin sheath integrity as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. DTI parameters consistently indicate a slight decrease of structural integrity in the carpal tunnel as a physiological site of median nerve entrapment. DTI is particularly sensitive, since these findings are observed in healthy participants. Our results encourage future studies to evaluate the potential of DTI in differentiating axon from myelin sheath injury in patients with manifest peripheral neuropathies. © 2015 Heckel et al.

AB  - Objectives: This study evaluated the potential of three-tesla diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography to detect changes of the radial (RN) and median (MN) nerves during transient upper arm compression by a silicon ring tourniquet. Methods: Axial T2-weighted and DTI sequences (b = 700 s/mm2, 16 gradient encoding directions) of 13 healthy volunteers were obtained. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the MN and RN were measured at the spiral groove and further visualized in 3D by deterministic tractography (thresholds: FA =.15, angle change = 27°). Results: Local/lesional RN FA values increased (p = 0.001) and ADC values decreased (p = 0.02) during a 20-min upper arm compression, whereas no significant FA (p = 0.49) or ADC (p = 0.73) changes of the MN were detected. There were no T2-w nerve signal changes or alterations of nerve trajectories in 3D. Conclusions: Acute nerve compression of the RN leads to changes of its three-tesla DTI metrics. Peripheral nerve DTI provides non-invasive insights into the “selective” vulnerability of the RN at the spiral groove. Key Points: • DTI-based neurography detects nerve changes during acute nerve compression. • Compression leads to a transient increase in local radial nerve FA values. • DTI provides insights into radial nerve vulnerability at the spiral groove. © 2015, European Society of Radiology.

AB  - Objectives To achieve 3-dimensional (3D) display of peripheral nerves in the wrist region by using maximum intensity projection (MIP) post-processing methods to reconstruct raw images acquired by a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan, and to explore its clinical applications. Methods We performed DTI scans in 6 (DTI6) and 25 (DTI25) diffusion directions on 20 wrists of 10 healthy young volunteers, 6 wrists of 5 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, 6 wrists of 6 patients with nerve lacerations, and one patient with neurofibroma. The MIP post-processing methods employed 2 types of DTI raw images: (1) single-direction and (2) T2-weighted trace. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median and ulnar nerves were measured at multiple testing sites. Two radiologists used custom evaluation scales to assess the 3D nerve imaging quality independently. Results In both DTI6 and DTI25, nerves in the wrist region could be displayed clearly by the 2 MIP post-processing methods. The FA and ADC values were not significantly different between DTI6 and DTI25, except for the FA values of the ulnar nerves at the level of pisiform bone (p = 0.03). As to the imaging quality of each MIP post-processing method, there were no significant differences between DTI6 and DTI25 (p &gt; 0.05). The imaging quality of single-direction MIP post-processing was better than that from T2-weighted traces (p &lt; 0.05) because of the higher nerve signal intensity. Conclusions Three-dimensional displays of peripheral nerves in the wrist region can be achieved by MIP post-processing for single-direction images and T2-weighted trace images for both DTI6 and DTI25. The FA and ADC values of the median nerves can be accurately measured by using DTI6 data. Adopting 6-direction DTI scan and MIP post-processing is an efficient method for evaluating peripheral nerves. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is hallmarked by degeneration of small unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers in the skin. Traditionally, it has been considered as a pure disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, previous work found that dysfunction of skin nerves led to abnormal recruitment of pain-related regions, suggesting that the brain may be affected in SFN. This report combined structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify structural and functional changes in the brain of 19 patients with SFN compared with 17 healthy controls. We applied tensor-based morphometry to detect brain structural alterations in SFN. Greater volume reduction in pain-processing regions, particularly the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices (ACCs), was associated with greater depletion of intraepidermal nerve fibers, a pathological biomarker of skin nerve degeneration. Based on the hypothesis that structural alterations in the pain-processing regions might impair their functional connectivity, we further applied psychophysiological interaction analysis to assess functional connectivity of the ACCs during noxious heat stimulation. There was significant reduction in functional connectivity from the ACCs to the limbic areas (the parahippocampal gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex), pain-processing area (the insula), and visuospatial areas (the cuneus). Moreover, the degree of reduction in functional connectivity for the ACC to the amygdala and the precuneus was linearly correlated with the severity of intraepidermal nerve fiber depletion. Our findings suggest that SFN is not a pure peripheral nervous system disorder. The pain-related brain networks tend to break into functionally independent components, with severity linked to the degree of skin nerve degeneration. © 2015 International Association for the Study of Pain.

AB  - Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a peripheral nerve disorder which impacts the living quality of patients both psychologically and physically. Whether HFS has structural changes under these specific stressors including psychological and physiological conditions in the CNS remains largely unknown. In the current study, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to evaluate changes in gray matter (GM) by using T1-weighted imaging in 25 HFS patients and 25 demographically similar healthy volunteers. The severity of the spasm was assessed using a Cohen evaluation scale. Hamilton anxiety (HAMA) and Hamilton depression (HAMD) rating scales were used to evaluate the affective conditions of subjects. 3D-FIESTA and 3D-TOF sequences were applied to evaluate the neurovascular compression (NVC) rating in each subject. In our results, we found that HFS patients had higher NVC rating scores than those of healthy volunteers, and the spasm severity rating was positively correlated with the NVC rating (. r=. 0.736, p<. 0.001). HFS patients had higher scores on the HAMA and HAMD compared with healthy volunteers. For the GM comparison, reductions were found in the thalamus, putamen, pallidum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus in patients with HFS compared with healthy volunteers. Additionally, the GM volume changes in the amygdala did not exhibit any significant between-group differences with HAMA and HAMD scores as covariates. Our results suggested that HFS probably led to GM volume abnormalities of the CNS. We indicated that the GM volume changes of the amygdala may be highly related to emotional factors. © 2015 IBRO.

AB  - Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy is a rare, autosomal-dominant inherited multisystem disorder usually manifesting with a rapidly progressive, axonal, distally-symmetric polyneuropathy. The detection of nerve injury by nerve conduction studies is limited, due to preferential involvement of small-fibres in early stages. We investigated whether lower limb nerve-injury can be detected, localized and quantified in vivo by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography. We prospectively included 20 patients (12 male and eight female patients, mean age 47.9 years, range 26-66) with confirmed mutation in the transthyretin gene: 13 with symptomatic polyneuropathy and seven asymptomatic gene carriers. A large age-and sex-matched cohort of healthy volunteers served as controls (20 male and 20 female, mean age 48.1 years, range 30-73). All patients received detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations and were scored using the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limbs, Neuropathy Deficit and Neuropathy Symptom Score. Magnetic resonance neurography (3 T) was performed with large longitudinal coverage from proximal thigh to ankle-level and separately for each leg (140 axial slices/leg) by using axial T2-weighted (repetition time/echo time = 5970/55 ms) and dual echo (repetition time 5210 ms, echo times 12 and 73 ms) turbo spin echo 2D sequences with spectral fat saturation. A 3D T2-weighted inversion-recovery sequence (repetition time/echo time 3000/202 ms) was acquired for imaging of the spinal nerves and lumbar plexus (50 axial slice reformations). Precise manual segmentation of the spinal/sciatic/tibial/common peroneal nerves was performed on each slice. Histogram-based normalization of nerve-voxel signal intensities was performed using the age-and sex-matched control group as normative reference. Nerve-voxels were subsequently classified as lesion-voxels if a threshold of 41.2 (normalized signal-intensity) was exceeded. At distal thigh level, where a predominant nerve- lesion-voxel burden was observed, signal quantification was performed by calculating proton spin density and T2-relaxation time as microstructural markers of nerve tissue integrity. The total number of nerve-lesion voxels (cumulated from proximal-to-distal) was significantly higher in symptomatic patients (20 405±1586) versus asymptomatic gene carriers (12 294±3199; P = 0.036) and versus controls (6536±467; P50.0001). It was also higher in asymptomatic carriers compared to controls (P = 0.043). The number of nerve-lesion voxels was significantly higher at thigh level compared to more distal levels (lower leg/ankle) of the lower extremities (f-value = 279.22, P50.0001). Further signal-quantification at this proximal site (thigh level) revealed a significant increase of proton-density (P50.0001) and T2-relaxation-time (P = 0.0011) in symptomatic patients, whereas asymptomatic genecarriers presented with a significant increase of proton-density only. Lower limb nerve injury could be detected and quantified in vivo on microstructural level by magnetic resonance neurography in symptomatic familial amyloid polyneuropathy, and also in yet asymptomatic gene carriers, in whom imaging detection precedes clinical and electrophysiological manifestation. Although symptoms start and prevail distally, the focus of predominant nerve injury and injury progression was found proximally at thigh level with strong and unambiguous lesion-contrast. Imaging of proximal nerve lesions, which are difficult to detect by nerve conduction studies, may have future implications also for other distally-symmetric polyneuropathies. © 2015 The Author.

AB  - The majority of previous studies on hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) were focused on peripheral nerves, whereas cerebral alterations in HNPP have been less attended to. In this work, DTI was used to detect the changes in WM, especially in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in HNPP patients for its sensitivity in probing the microstructure of WM, the sensitive metric was searched for probing cerebral alterations and the regional distribution of cerebral abnormalities was identified. Twelve HNPP patients and 12 age-and gender-matched healthy controls underwent the conventional MRI, DTI scan, and electrophysiological examination. The conventional MRI images were first analyzed to identify abnormal intense regions and the NAWM regions. NAWM refers to the white matter regions that do not include the lesions on conventional MRI. The ADC and FA values of the NAWM were then measured and compared between patient and control groups. The sensitivity and specificity of 3 methods and the cerebral regional distribution of MR signal abnormalities were further analyzed. Hyperintense foci were observed on T2WI and FLAIR images in 6 patients. Compared to the controls, FA values of the patients were significantly lower in bilateral frontal, orbitofrontal, and temporal NAWMs; whereas the electrophysiological examination results of patients and controls exhibited no statistically significant difference. The sensitivity of FA value was higher than that of electrophysiological examination and conventional MRI. The majority of abnormal signals on conventional MRI images and abnormal FA values were located in the frontal and temporal lobes. The results of our study show cerebral WM changes in HNPP patients. FA value in DTI has been shown to be sensitive to the cerebral microstructural changes in HNPP. The frontal lobe is the predilection site that is most involved in HNPP.

AB  - The diagnostic workup and surgical therapy for peripheral nerve tumors and tumorlike lesions are challenging. Magnetic resonance imaging is the standard diagnostic tool in the preoperative workup. However, even with advanced pulse sequences such as diffusion tensor imaging for MR neurography, the ability to differentiate tumor entities based on histological features remains limited. In particular, rare tumor entities different from schwannomas and neurofibromas are difficult to anticipate before surgical exploration and histological confirmation. High-resolution ultrasound (HRU) has become another important tool in the preoperative evaluation of peripheral nerves. Ongoing software and technical developments with transducers of up to 17-18 MHz enable high spatial resolution with tissue-differentiating properties. Unfortunately, high-frequency ultrasound provides low tissue penetration. The authors developed a setting in which intraoperative HRU was used and in which the direct sterile contact between the ultrasound transducer and the surgically exposed nerve pathology was enabled to increase structural resolution and contrast. In a case-guided fashion, the authors report the sonographic characteristics of rare tumor entities shown by intraoperative HRU and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. © AANS, 2015.

AB  - Successful management of peripheral nerve trauma relies on accurate localization of the injury and grading of the severity of nerve injury to determine whether surgical intervention is required. Existing techniques, such as electrodiagnostic studies and conventional imaging modalities, provide important information, but are limited by being unable to distinguish severe nerve lesions in continuity that will recover from those that will not. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of peripheral nerves provide a novel technique to localize and grade nerve injury, by assessing the integrity of the nerve fibers across the site of nerve injury. Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography also hold promise as markers of early nerve regeneration, prior to clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of recovery. In the present review, the techniques of peripheral nerve DTI and tractography are discussed with respect to peripheral nerve trauma, with illustrative cases demonstrating potential roles of these novel approaches. © AANS, 2015.

AB  - Diagnosis and management of peripheral nerve injury is complicated by the inability to assess microstructural features of injured nerve fibers via clinical examination and electrophysiology. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to accurately detect nerve injury and regeneration in crush models of peripheral nerve injury, but no prior studies have been conducted on nerve transection, a surgical emergency that can lead to permanent weakness or paralysis. Acute sciatic nerve injuries were performed microsurgically to produce multiple grades of nerve transection in rats that were harvested 1 hour after surgery. High-resolution diffusion tensor images from ex vivo sciatic nerves were obtained using diffusion-weighted spin-echo acquisitions at 4.7 T. Fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced at the injury sites of transected rats compared with sham rats. Additionally, minor eigenvalues and radial diffusivity were profoundly elevated at all injury sites and were negatively correlated to the degree of injury. Diffusion tensor tractography showed discontinuities at all injury sites and significantly reduced continuous tract counts. These findings demonstrate that high-resolution DTI is a promising tool for acute diagnosis and grading of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries. © AANS, 2015.

AB  - Object The majority of growing and/or symptomatic peripheral nerve tumors are schwannomas and neurofibromas. They are almost always benign and can usually be resected while minimizing motor and sensory deficits if approached with the proper expertise and techniques. Intraoperative electrophysiological stimulation and recording techniques allow the surgeon to map the surface of the tumor in an effort to identify and thus avoid damaging functioning nerve fibers. Recently, MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques have permitted the visualization of axons, because of their anisotropic properties, in peripheral nerves. The object of this study was to compare the distribution of nerve fibers as revealed by direct electrical stimulation with that seen on preoperative MR DTI. Methods The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with a peripheral nerve or nerve root tumor between March 2012 and January 2014. Diffusion tensor imaging and intraoperative data had been prospectively collected for patients with peripheral nerve tumors that were resected. Preoperative identification of the nerve fiber location in relation to the nerve tumor surface as seen on DTI studies was compared with the nerve fiber's intraoperative localization using electrophysiological stimulation and recordings. Results In 23 patients eligible for study there was good correlation between nerve fiber location on DTI and its anatomical location seen intraoperatively. Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated the relationship of nerve fibers relative to the tumor with 95.7% sensitivity, 66.7% specificity, 75% positive predictive value, and 93.8% negative predictive value. Conclusions Preoperative DTI techniques are useful in helping the peripheral nerve surgeon to both determine the risks involved in resecting a nerve tumor and plan the safest surgical approach. © AANS, 2015.

AB  - Object Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) are uncommon but bear a significant risk of malignancy. High-resolution MRI is the standard technique for characterizing PNSTs. However, planning the appropriate extent of resection and subsequent reconstructive strategies is highly dependent on the intraoperative findings because preoperative MRI evaluation can be insufficient. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) represents a recently developed advanced MRI technique that reveals the microstructure of tissues based on monitoring the random movement of water molecules. DTT has the potential to provide diagnostic insights beyond conventional MRI techniques due to its mapping of specific fibrillar nerve structures. Here, DTT was applied to evaluate PNSTs and to examine the usefulness of this method for the correct delineation of tumor and healthy nerve tissue and the value of this information in the preoperative planning of surgical interventions. Met hods In this prospective study, patients with the clinical symptoms of a PNST were investigated using DTT 3-Tesla MRI scans. Image data processing and tractography were performed using the FACT (fiber assessment by continuous tracking) algorithm and multiple-regions-of-interest approach. The surgical findings were then compared with the results of the DTT MRI scans. Preoperative fascicle visualization and the correlation with the intraoperative findings were graded. Res ults In a 21-month period, 12 patients with PNSTs were investigated (7 female and 5 male patients with a mean age of 46.2 ± 19.2 years). All patients underwent surgical removal of the tumor. Schwannoma was the most common benign histopathological finding (n = 7), whereas 2 malignant lesions were detected. In 10 of 12 patients, good preoperative nerve fascicle visualization was achieved using DTT scans. In 9 of 10 patients with good preoperative fascicle visualization, good intraoperative correlation between the DTT scans and surgical anatomy was found. Con clusions DTT properly visualizes the peripheral nerve fascicles and their correct anatomical relation to PNST. DTT represents a promising new method for the preinterventional planning of nerve tumor resection. © AANS, 2015.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) adds diagnostic accuracy in magnetic resonance neurography. Materials and Methods This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. We enrolled 16 patients with peripheral polyneuropathy of various etiologies involving the upper arm and 30 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3 T using transverse T2-weighted (T2-w) turbo spin echo and spin echo planar imaging diffusion-weighted sequences. T2-weighted normalized signal (nT2), fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) of the median, ulnar, and radial nerves were quantified after manual segmentation. Diagnostic performance of each separate parameter and combinations of parameters was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Bootstrap validation was used to adjust for potential overfitting. Results Average nT2, ADC, RD, and AD values of the median, ulnar, and radial nerve were significantly increased in neuropathy patients compared with that in healthy controls (nT2, 1.49 ± 0.05 vs 1.05 ± 0.05; ADC, 1.4 × 10-3 ± 2.8 × 10-5 mm2/s vs 1.1 × 10-3 ± 1.3 × 10-5 mm2/s; RD, 9.5 × 10-4 ± 2.9 × 10-5 mm2/s vs 7.2 × 10-4 ± 1.3 × 10-5 mm2/s; AD, 2.3 × 10-3 ± 3.7 × 10-5 mm2/s vs 2.0 × 10-3 ± 2.2 × 10-5 mm2/s; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Fractional anisotropy values were significantly decreased in patients (0.51 ± 0.01 vs 0.59 ± 0.01; P < 0.001). T2-weighted normalized signal and DTI parameters had comparable diagnostic accuracy (adjusted AUC: T2-w, 0.92; FA, 0.88; ADC, 0.89; AD, 0.84; RD, 0.86). Combining DTI parameters significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy over single-parameter analysis. In addition, the combination of nT2 with DTI parameters yielded excellent adjusted AUCs up to 0.97 (nT2 + FA). Conclusions Diffusion tensor imaging has high diagnostic accuracy in peripheral neuropathy. Combining DTI with T2 can outperform T2-w imaging alone and provides added value in magnetic resonance neurography. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - MRI plays a central role in the assessment of pediatric musculoskeletal soft tissue tumors. Although these neoplasms may initially be evaluated on other modalities, such as sonography, MRI is essential for accurately determining the extent of disease. Traditionally, MRI has been performed with sequences that provide excellent anatomic detail, with T1-weighted, fluid-sensitive, and static postcontrast T1-weighted sequences. However, with the introduction of noncontrast sequences such as diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to the arsenal of available MRI techniques, functional and metabolic features of a neoplasm can now be examined noninvasively. These more recent MRI methods offer information for lesion characterization, the assessment of treatment response, and the distinction of postoperative scar from recurrence. Dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging is another useful functional technique that can be acquired before conventional static postcontrast imaging, without requiring additional contrast material. This review presents recent advances in MRI methodology that enable a comprehensive clinical assessment of musculoskeletal tumors in the pediatric population. The roles and challenges of combining anatomic, functional, and metabolic MRI sequences will be discussed as they relate to newly discovered soft tissue tumors in children. © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a method to generate multi-organ acellular matrices. Using a foetal sheep model have developed a method of systemic pulsatile perfusion via the umbilical artery which allows for simultaneous multi-organ decellularization. Twenty sheep foetuses were systemically perfused with Triton X-100 and sodium dodecyl sulphate. Following completion of the whole-body decellularization, multiple biopsy samples were taken from different parts of 21 organs to ascertain complete cell component removal in the preserved extracellular matrices. Both the natural and decellularized organs were subjected to several examinations. The samples were obtained from the skin, eye, ear, nose, throat, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, musculoskeletal, central nervous and peripheral nervous systems. The histological results depicted well-preserved extracellular matrix (ECM) integrity and intact vascular structures, without any evidence of residual cellular materials, in all decellularized bioscaffolds. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and biochemical properties remained intact, similar to their age-matched native counterparts. Preservation of the collagen structure was evaluated by a hydroxyproline assay. Dense organs such as bone and muscle were also completely decellularized, with a preserved ECM structure. Thus, as shown in this study, several organs and different tissues were decellularized using a perfusion-based method, which has not been previously accomplished. Given the technical challenges that exist for the efficient generation of biological scaffolds, the current results may pave the way for obtaining a variety of decellularized scaffolds from a single donor. In this study, there have been unique responses to the single acellularization protocol in foetuses, which may reflect the homogeneity of tissues and organs in the developing foetal body. © 2015 International Journal of Experimental Pathology.

AB  - Introduction: In this study we sought to determine the cross-sectional area (CSA) of peripheral nerves in patients with distinct subtypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Methods: Ulnar and median nerve ultrasound was performed in 78 ALS patients [classic, n=21; upper motor neuron dominant (UMND), n=14; lower motor neuron dominant (LMND), n=20; bulbar, n=15; primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), n=8] and 18 matched healthy controls. Results: Compared with controls, ALS patients had significant, distally pronounced reductions of ulnar CSA (forearm/wrist level) across all disease groups, except for PLS. Median nerve CSA (forearm/wrist level) did not differ between controls and ALS. Conclusion: Ulnar nerve ultrasound in ALS subgroups revealed significant differences in distal CSA values, which suggests it has value as a marker of LMN involvement. Its potential was particularly evident in the UMND and PLS groups, which can be hard to separate clinically, yet their accurate separation has major prognostic implications. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background Krabbe disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by rapid demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The only available treatment, unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation, is effective only if performed before clinical symptoms appear. Phenotypic expressions of disease-causing mutations vary widely, but genotype-phenotype relationships are unclear. Therefore, we evaluated diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography with volumetric analysis as a biomarker of early white matter changes and functional disability in presymptomatic infants. Methods We obtained DTI and structural scans of newborns with early-infantile Krabbe disease (n = 9) diagnosed by family history or newborn screening. We compared white matter fiber tract properties to those of normal controls (n = 336) and assessed the ability of tract-based properties to predict longitudinal development in four functional domains (cognitive, fine motor, gross motor, adaptive behavior) after treatment with unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation. We also assessed the relationship between the standard evaluation (modified Loes score) and DTI results, and the volumetric differences between the Krabbe subjects and normal controls. Findings Reductions in fractional anisotropy were significant in the corticospinal tract in the Krabbe patients compared to controls, which strongly correlated with motor and cognitive outcomes after transplantation. Significant regional differences were observed in the splenium and uncinate fasciculus in Krabbe patients and these differences correlated only with cognitive outcomes. Regional brain volumes of Krabbe patients were slightly larger than controls. Loes scores did not correlate with DTI results. Interpretation Neonatal microstructural abnormalities correlate with neurodevelopmental treatment outcomes in patients treated for infantile Krabbe disease. DTI with quantitative tractography is an excellent biomarker for evaluating infants with Krabbe disease identified through newborn screening. ©2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The stress system provides integration of both neurochemical and somatic physiologic functions within organisms as an adaptive mechanism to changing environmental conditions throughout evolution. In mammals and primates the complexity and sophistication of these systems have surpassed other species in triaging neurochemical and physiologic signaling to maximize chances of survival. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and its related peptides and receptors have been identified over the last three decades and are fundamental molecular initiators of the stress response. They are crucial in the top down regulatory cascade over a myriad of neurochemical, neuroendocrine and sympathetic nervous system events. From neuroscience, we've seen that stress activation impacts behavior, endocrine and somatic physiology and influences neurochemical events that one can capture in real time with current imaging technologies. To delineate these effects one can demonstrate how the CRH neuronal networks infiltrate critical cognitive, emotive and autonomic regions of the central nervous system (CNS) with somatic effects. Abundant preclinical and clinical studies show inter-regulatory actions of CRH with multiple neurotransmitters/peptides. Stress, both acute and chronic has epigenetic effects which magnify genetic susceptibilities to alter neurochemistry; stress system activation can add critical variables in design and interpretation of basic and clinical neuroscience and related research. This review will attempt to provide an overview of the spectrum of known functions and speculative actions of CRH and stress responses in light of imaging technology and its interpretation. Metabolic and neuroreceptor positron emission/single photon tomography (PET/SPECT), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), anatomic MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (pMRS) are technologies that can delineate basic mechanisms of neurophysiology and pharmacology. Stress modulates the myriad of neurochemical and networks within and controlled through the central and peripheral nervous system and the effects of stress activation on imaging will be highlighted. © 2014.

AB  - Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) are neoplasms derived from neoplastic Schwann cells or their precursors. Whereas benign PNSTs are relatively common and considered curable lesions, their malignant counterparts are rare but highly aggressive and require early diagnosis and treatment. MR imaging has been the modality of choice for noninvasive evaluation of PNSTs. This article discusses the features of PNSTs in conventional and advanced MR imaging, and it emphasizes the features that help differentiate benign and malignant variants. © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Pathologic conditions of the brachial plexus often result in serious and disabling complications. With the increasing availability and use of new and powerful MRI sequences and coils, understanding and assessment of the complex anatomy and pathology of the brachial plexus have been greatly facilitated. These new technical developments have led to an improved assessment of brachial plexus lesions, thereby improving patient care. In this article we describe various MRI techniques for the evaluation of the brachial plexus obtained at 1.5 T and 3 T, and we explain differences and similarities between sequences and protocols performed on MRI equipment from different vendors. The main characteristics of pathologic conditions affecting the brachial plexus are discussed and illustrated, as well as their differential diagnoses, with an emphasis on key imaging findings and relevance for patient management. Pitfalls related to suboptimal technique and image interpretation are also addressed. © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a powerful MR imaging technique that can be used to probe the microstructural environment of highly anisotropic tissues such as peripheral nerves. DTI has been used predominantly in the central nervous system, and its application in the peripheral nervous system does pose some challenges related to imaging artifacts, the small caliber of peripheral nerves, and low water proton density. However advances in MRI hardware and software have made it possible to use the technique in the peripheral nervous system and to obtain functional data relating to the effect of pathologic processes on peripheral nerves. This article reviews the imaging principles behind DTI and examines the literature regarding its application in assessing peripheral nerves. © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used in the study of the central nervous system. DTI represents a potential diagnostic tool for the peripheral nerve. However, more detailed information is needed for application of DTI in the clinical setting. In this study, peripheral degeneration and regeneration were evaluated using DTI-based analyses in a rabbit model. The changes in DTI parameters were compared to histological and functional changes after nerve injury. We used a high magnetic field (7.04T) MRI system. Japanese white male rabbits were used as the model of sciatic nerve crush injury. MR images were obtained before injury and at 2, 4, 6 and 8weeks post-injury. The DTI parameters of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (λ||), and radial diffusivity (λ⊥) were calculated. Our results showed decreased FA and increased λ⊥ during the degenerative phase after sciatic nerve injury. In contrast, increased FA and decreased λ⊥ were observed during the regenerative phase. FA changes were correlated with axon number and with motor function recovery, assessed with the toe-spreading index. This study clearly demonstrates the validity of applying DTI parameters to the in vivo evaluation of peripheral nerve regeneration. Furthermore, results suggest that DTI can be a potent tool for predicting the extent of functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the ultrasound (US) characteristics of peripheral nerves in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and their correlations with electrodiagnostic (EDX) characteristics. Methods: Nineteen patients with CIDP and 19 healthy controls matched by age and body mass index were included in a blind case-control, observational study. All patients underwent a neurologic examination (including inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment [INCAT] and Medical Research Council [MRC] sum score) and an EDX study. Each patient and each control underwent a US study of 14 nerve segments, yielding a total number of 266 segments scanned in each group. Results: US changes, characterized by an increased nerve cross-sectional area (NCSA), were detected in 53% of the 266 patient nerve segments. Mean NCSA was higher in nerve segments of patients than in those of controls (p < 0.001). Nerve segments with abnormal US belonged to patients with longer disease duration, lower MRC sum score, higher INCAT score, and progressive disease form (all p < 0.0001). All the aforementioned variables were independently associated with the occurrence of US changes. Motor nerve conduction was significantly lower in nerve segments with increased NCSA than in those with normal NCSA (p < 0.0001). NCSA in segments with prevalent myelin damage was higher than that in segments with prevalent axonal damage (p 0.001) or in segments with normal EDX characteristics (p < 0.0001). NCSA and motor nerve conduction velocity were inversely correlated in nerve segments with EDX evidence of myelin damage (R 0.599; p < 0.0001). Conduction blocks were associated with increased NCSA (p 0.001). Conclusions: US may, similar to MRI, have a supporting role in the diagnosis of CIDP. US and EDX changes are correlated. © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Introduction: This diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) study aimed to clarify the relationship of peripheral nerves and soft tissue tumors (STTs) in 3D to optimize subsequent treatment. Methods: Twenty-six consecutive STT patients (histologically malignant, n=10; intermediate, n=3; and benign, n=13) underwent 3-Tesla MRI using an echoplanar DTI sequence. Deterministic tractography was performed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured within peritumoral and distant regions of interest. Results: Tractography depicted the 3D course of the sciatic (n=12), femoral (n=2), tibial (n=7), fibular (n=2), median (n=1), musculocutaneous (n=1), and ulnar (n=1) nerves in a regular (n=8 of 18, 44.4%) or thinned (n=7 of 18, 38.9%) fashion. The lowest peritumoral FA values, abrupt thinning, and/or complete discontinuity of trajectories were found in 2 cases with histologically proven tumoral nerve infiltration. Conclusions: DTI clarifies the 3D topography between major peripheral nerves and STTs and may be helpful in the assessment of peripheral nerve infiltration by malignant tumors. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Accumulated evidence from experimental animal models suggests that neuronal loss within the dorsal horn is involved in the development and/or maintenance of peripheral neuropathic pain. However, to date, no study has specifically investigated whether such neuroanatomical changes also occur at this level in humans. Using brain imaging techniques, we sought to determine whether anatomical changes were present in the spinal trigeminal nucleus in subjects with chronic orofacial neuropathic pain. In 22 subjects with painful trigeminal neuropathy and 44 pain-free controls, voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted anatomical images and diffusion tensor images were used to assess regional gray matter volume and microstructural changes within the brainstem. In addition, deterministic tractography was used to assess the integrity of ascending pain pathways. Orofacial neuropathic pain was associated with significant regional gray matter volume decreases, fractional anisotropy increases, and mean diffusivity decreases within the spinal trigeminal nucleus, specifically the subnucleus oralis. In addition, tractography revealed no significant differences in diffusivity properties in the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve, the spinal trigeminal tract, or the ventral trigeminothalamic tracts in painful trigeminal neuropathy subjects compared with controls. These data reveal that chronic neuropathic pain in humans is associated with discrete alterations in the anatomy of the primary synapse. These neuroanatomical changes may be critical for the generation and/or maintenance of pathological pain. © 2015 the authors.

AB  - Growing evidence indicates that alterations within the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are involved at an early stage in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenetic cascade. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neurophysiologic analyses, and histologic analyses were used to monitor the extent of PNS damage in the hSOD-1 ALS rat model. The imaging signature of the disease was defined using in vivo MRI of the sciatic nerve. Initial abnormalities were detected in the nerves by an increase in T2 relaxation time before the onset of clinical disease; diffusion MRI showed a progressive increase in mean and radial diffusivity and reduction of fractional anisotropy at advanced stages of disease. Histologic analysis demonstrated early impairment of the blood-nerve barrier followed by acute axonal degeneration associated with endoneurial edema and macrophage response in motor nerve compartments. Progressive axonal degeneration and motor nerve fiber loss correlated with MRI and neurophysiologic changes. These functional and morphologic investigations of the PNS might be applied in following disease progression in preclinical therapeutic studies. This study establishes the PNS signature in this rat ALS model (shedding new light into pathogenesis) and provides a rationale for translating into future systematic MRI studies of PNS involvement in patients with ALS.

AB  - Recent developments in the field of peripheral nerve imaging extend the capabilities of imaging modalities to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with peripheral nerve maladies. Methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its derivative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), ultrasound (US) and positron emission tomography (PET) are capable of assessing nerve structure and function following injury and relating the state of the nerve to electrophysiological and histological analysis. Of the imaging methods surveyed here, each offered unique and interesting advantages related to the field. MRI offered the opportunity to visualize immune activity on the injured nerve throughout the course of the regeneration process, and DTI offered numerical characterization of the injury and the ability to develop statistical bases for diagnosing injury. US extends imaging to the treatment phase by enabling more precise analgesic applications following surgery, and PET represents a novel method of assessing nerve injury through analysis of relative metabolism rates in injured and healthy tissue. Exciting new possibilities to enhance and extend the abilities of imaging methods are also discussed, including innovative contrast agents, some of which enable multimodal imaging approaches and present opportunities for treatment application. © 2015 S.

AB  - Purpose: To compare a novel combined acquisition technique (CAT) of turbo-spin-echo (TSE) and echo-planar-imaging (EPI) with conventional TSE. CAT reduces the electromagnetic energy load transmitted for spin excitation. This radiofrequency (RF) burden is limited by the specific absorption rate (SAR) for patient safety. SAR limits restrict high-field MRI applications, in particular. Material and Methods: The study was approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. T2- and PD-weighted brain images of n = 40 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients were acquired by CAT and TSE at 3 Tesla. Lesions were recorded by two blinded, board-certificated neuroradiologists. Diagnostic equivalence of CAT and TSE to detect MS lesions was evaluated along with their SAR, sound pressure level (SPL) and sensations of acoustic noise, heating, vibration and peripheral nerve stimulation. Results: Every MS lesion revealed on TSE was detected by CAT according to both raters (Cohen's kappa of within-rater/ across-CAT/TSE lesion detection κCAT = 1.00, at an inter-rater lesion detection agreement of κLES = 0.82). CAT reduced the SAR burden significantly compared to TSE (p&lt;0.001). Mean SAR differences between TSE and CAT were 29.0 (±5.7) % for the T2-contrast and 32.7 (±21.9) % for the PD-contrast (expressed as percentages of the effective SAR limit of 3.2 W/kg for head examinations). Average SPL of CAT was no louder than during TSE. Sensations of CAT- vs. TSE-induced heating, noise and scanning vibrations did not differ. Conclusion: T2-/PD-CAT is diagnostically equivalent to TSE for MS lesion detection yet substantially reduces the RF exposure. Such SAR reduction facilitates high-field MRI applications at 3 Tesla or above and corresponding protocol standardizations but CAT can also be used to scan faster, at higher resolution or with more slices. According to our data, CAT is no more uncomfortable than TSE scanning. © 2014 Biller et al.

AB  - Objective: We sought to determine lesion sites and spatial lesion patterns in spontaneous anterior interosseous nerve syndrome (AINS) with high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Methods: In 20 patients with AINS and 20 age- and sex-matched controls, MRN of median nerve fascicles was performed at 3T with large longitudinal anatomical coverage (upper arm/elbow/ forearm): 135 contiguous axial slices (T2-weighted: echo time/repetition time 52/7,020 ms, time of acquisition: 15 minutes 48 seconds, in-plane resolution: 0.25 × 0.25 mm). Lesion classification was performed by visual inspection and by quantitative analysis of normalized T2 signal after segmentation of median nerve voxels. Results: In all patients and no controls, T2 lesions of individual fascicles were observed within upper arm median nerve trunk and strictly followed a somatotopic/internal topography: affected were those motor fascicles that will form the anterior interosseous nerve further distally while other fascicles were spared. Predominant lesion focus was at a mean distance of 14.6 ± 5.4 cm proximal to the humeroradial joint. Discriminative power of quantitative T2 signal analysis and of qualitative lesion rating was high, with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity (p < 0.0001). Fascicular T2 lesion patterns were rated as multifocal (n = 17), monofocal (n = 2), or indeterminate (n = 1) by 2 independent observers with strong agreement (kappa = 0.83). Conclusion: It has been difficult to prove the existence of fascicular/partial nerve lesions in spontaneous neuropathies using clinical and electrophysiologic findings. With MRN, fascicular lesions with strict somatotopic organization were observed in upper arm median nerve trunks of patients with AINS. Our data strongly support that AINS in the majority of cases is not a surgically treatable entrapment neuropathy but a multifocal mononeuropathy selectively involving, within the main trunk of the median nerve, the motor fascicles that continue distally to form the anterior interosseous nerve.

AB  - An in-depth knowledge of the imaging characteristics of the common neurocutaneous diseases (NCD) described in this article will help neurologists understand the screening imaging modalities in these patients. The future of neuroimaging is geared towards developing and refining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. The detection of tumors in NCD has greatly improved with availability of high-field strength 3T MRI machines. Neuroimaging will remain at the heart and soul of the multidisciplinary care of such complex diagnoses to guide early detection and monitor treatment. © 2014.

AB  - Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is a specialized technique that is rapidly becoming part of the diagnostic algorithm of peripheral nerve pathology. However, in order for this modality to be considered appropriate, its value compared with current methods of diagnosis should be established. Therefore, radiologists involved in MRN research should use appropriate methodology to evaluate MRN's effectiveness with a multidisciplinary approach. This article reviews the various tiers of research available to assess the clinical value of a diagnostic modality with an emphasis on how to evaluate the impact of MRN on diagnostic thinking and therapeutic decisions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) examination is rapidly becoming a part of the diagnostic algorithm of patients with peripheral neuropathy; however, because of the technical demands and the lack of required reading skills, the examination is relatively underutilized and is currently limited to a few tertiary care centers. The radiologists with interest in peripheral nerve imaging should be able to perform and interpret this examination to exploit its potential for widespread use. This article outlines the systematic, stepwise approach to its interpretation and a brief discussion of the imaging pitfalls. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The most common sites of nerve entrapment are in the upper extremity, commonly diagnosed based on clinical findings and electrophysiologic studies. Cross-sectional imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, have been used to enhance diagnostic accuracy and provide anatomic mapping of abnormalities. MR neurography offers multiplanar high-resolution imaging of upper extremity nerves as well as adjacent soft tissues, and provides an objective assessment of the neuromuscular anatomy and related abnormalities. This article reviews the normal 3-T MR neurographic appearance of the upper extremity nerves, and abnormal findings related to injury, entrapment, and other pathologic conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Various methods of cross-sectional imaging are used for visualization of the cranial nerves, relying heavily on MR imaging. The success of the MR imaging sequences for visualization of cranial nerves depends on their anatomic context at the point of evaluation. The heterogeneity of opinion regarding optimal evaluation of the cranial nerves is partly a function of the complexity of cranial nerve anatomy. A variety of approaches are advocated and variations in equipment and terminology cloud the field. This article proposes a segmental classification and corresponding nomenclature for imaging evaluation of the cranial nerves and reviews technical considerations and applicable literature. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the nerves, commonly known as MR neurography is increasingly being used as noninvasive means of diagnosing peripheral nerve disease. High-resolution imaging protocols aimed at imaging the nerves of the hip, thigh, knee, leg, ankle, and foot can demonstrate traumatic or iatrogenic injury, tumorlike lesions, or entrapment of the nerves, causing a potential loss of motor and sensory function in the affected area. A thorough understanding of normal MR imaging and gross anatomy, as well as MR findings in the presence of peripheral neuropathies will aid in accurate diagnosis and ultimately help guide clinical management. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Previous nonlinear gradient research has focused on trajectories that reconstruct images with a minimum number of echoes. Here we describe sequences where the nonlinear gradients vary in time to acquire the image in a single readout. The readout is designed to be very smooth so that it can be compressed to minimal time without violating peripheral nerve stimulation limits, yielding an image from a single 4 ms echo. Theory and Methods: This sequence was inspired by considering the code of each voxel, i.e. the phase accumulation that a voxel follows through the readout, an approach connected to traditional encoding theory. We present simulations for the initial sequence, a low slew rate analog, and higher resolution reconstructions. Results: Extremely fast acquisitions are achievable, though as one would expect, SNR is reduced relative to the slower Cartesian sampling schemes because of the high gradient strengths. Conclusions: The prospect that nonlinear gradients can acquire images in a single <10 ms echo makes this a novel and interesting approach to image encoding. © 2014 Galiana, Constable.

AB  - Purpose: Falls and mobility problems are common causes of morbidity and death in elderly people, yet their causes are poorly understood. Slowing of gait is a prominent feature of human aging, even in the absence of specific diseases, and it is strongly associated with falls, dementia, and mortality. At the same time, gait and balance are dependent upon the brain's ability to maintain cerebral perfusion during standing and walking. The concept of cerebrovascular reserve has emerged as a potential biomarker for a syndrome of slow gait speed, and as an indicator of both functional decline and fall risk. Cerebrovascular reserve is brain's ability to maintain perfusion during physical activities, and to redistribute blood supply to areas with high energy demands. However, the relationship between cerebral hemodynamics, cardiovascular control, and locomotion control for standing and walking is not well understood, and has not been adequately studied. Method: Cardiovascular risk factors alter brain perfusion regulation and accelerate the effects of aging on gait and balance. Hypertension and diabetes are the most prevalent risk factors. Hypertension affects more than a third of world's population. Among those who are 65 years and older, almost 75% have hypertension1,2 and 26% have diabetes3. Cerebromicrovascular disease associated with hypertension, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors, including age, is linked with regional hypoperfusion, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and brain volume loss on MRI, as well as with neuronal degeneration, slower gait speed, and cognitive decline in elderly people4-9. Metabolic syn drome, hypertension, and stroke were each independently associated with cognitive and functional decline later in life10.The Honolulu Aging study shows that high systolic BP (120-140 and >140 mmHg) in midlife increases the risk of late-life dementia11. Both diseases have been associated with syncope (fainting) or orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure decline during standing) that account for up to 6% of hospital admissions. Up to 58% of those with dementia experienced a systolic BP decrease of ≥10 mmHg in later life11. By the age of 70, half of the population has experienced syncope or a fall at least once. With increasing age, the frequency and severity of syncope events increases, further elevating the risk for injurious falls12. Results & Discussion: Diabetes is associated with regional hypoperfusion13,14, gray matter atrophy and peripheral neuropathy, slower gait speed, and worse functional outcomes. In diabetic subjects, slower walking correlates with worse perfusion in the brain and more brain volume loss. Furthermore, diabetic subjects with peripheral neuropathy that have slower and less steady gaits and increased risk of falling are dependent upon gray matter volume in the cerebellum and other brain regions to maintain balance15. Furthermore, the presence of WMHs in diabetic and hypertensive subjects worsens dynamic balance parameters16. In summary, cardiovascular risk factors accelerate brain aging and further aggravate the impact of aging on locomotion and balance, therefore increasing the risks for falls and fall related injuries.

AB  - Objective: The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a novel magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) MRI assay of the proximal sciatic nerve (SN), which is inaccessible via current tools for assessing peripheral nerves, and (2) to evaluate the resulting MTR values as a potential biomarker of myelin content changes in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases. Methods: MTR was measured in the SN of patients with CMT type 1A (CMT1A, n = 10), CMT type 2A (CMT2A, n = 3), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (n = 3), and healthy controls (n = 21). Additional patients without a genetically confirmed subtype (n = 4), but whose family histories and electrophysiologic tests were consistent with CMT, were also included. The relationship between MTR and clinical neuropathy scores was assessed, and the interscan and inter-rater reliability of MTR was estimated. Results: Mean volumetric MTR values were significantly decreased in the SN of patients with CMT1A (33.8 ± 3.3 percent units) and CMT2A (31.5 ± 1.9 percent units) relative to controls (37.2 6 2.3 percent units). A significant relationship between MTR and disability scores was also detected (p = 0.01 for genetically confirmed patients only, p = 0.04 for all patients). From interscan and inter-rater reliability analyses, proximal nerve MTR values were repeatable at the slicewise and mean volumetric levels. Conclusions: MTR measurements may be a viable biomarker of proximal nerve pathology in patients with CMT. © 2014 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. MRI is increasingly being used to evaluate extracranial peripheral nerve disease in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to systematically review the accuracy of MRI in distinguishing normal from abnormal extracranial peripheral nerves. CONCLUSION. There is significant heterogeneity between studies investigating the accuracy of MRI. Studies have shown that nerve T2-weighted or STIR hyperintensity, nerve enlargement, and nerve flattening are associated with peripheral nerve disease. © American Roentgen Ray Society.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this studywas to prospectively estimatemagnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging parameters in distal portions of crushed sciatic nerves in rabbits and correlation with neurological function and histology.
Methods: Thirty-two rabbits were randomly divided into 8 groups and followed up at 10 weeks. The right sciatic nerves were crushed, and the left sciatic nerves served as the control group with sham operation. Another 4 rabbits were chosen in the normal control group. Diffusion tensor imaging scan was obtained on bilateral sciatic nerves using spin-echo singleshot echo planar imaging. The values of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient, and eigenvalue (λ and λτ) were measured on diffusion tensor imaging. Quantitative assessment of functional recovery in crushed nerves included toe-spreading reflex and modified Tarlov score, as well as pathology of the injured nerves.
Results: Fractional anisotropy of distal portions in injured nerves reduced slightly on the first day and dropped to the minimum at the fourth day after surgery. Then, FA increased gradually from the eighth day to the eighth week. After that, FA recovered nearly normal in the 10th week after injury. There was statistical significance in FA during 4 days to the eighth week and λτ values between distal portions of injured nerves and normal control nerves (P &lt; 0.05). Fractional anisotropy of distal portions to injured nerves correlated significantly with the nerve function score(r = 0.898, P &lt; 0.01), whereas λτ of distal portions of injured nerves demonstrated negative correlation with the nerve function score(r = -0.820, &lt;0.01). Fractional anisotropy values of distal portions of injured nerves formed a similar time course as functional recovery, whereas λτ indicated a opposite trend.
Conclusions: The changes in FA and λτ of distal portions of injured sciatic nerves correlatewellwith functional recovery and histology. Therefore, FA and λτ of distal portions of injured sciatic nerves can be used as a marker to monitorWallerian degeneration and regeneration of crushed sciatic nerves.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the ability of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 to help detect the mildest nerve lesion conceivable, that is, subclinical ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.
Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3.0 T by using proton density- and T2- weighted relaxometry and DTI on elbows in 30 healthy subjects without clinical evidence of neuropathy. Quantitative analysis of ulnar nerve T2 and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed, and T2 and FA values were correlated to electrical nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) with Pearson correlation analysis. Additional qualitative assessment of T2-weighted and FA images was performed by two readers, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated.
Results: Ten of the 30 subjects (33%) had NCV slowing across the elbow segment. Compared with subjects without NCV slowing, subjects with slowing had decreased FA values (0.51 ± 0.09 vs 0.41 ± 0.07, respectively; P = .006) and increased T2 values (64.2 msec ± 10.9 vs 76.2 msec ± 13.7, respectively; P = .01) in the proximal ulnar sulcus. FA values showed a significant correlation (P = .01) with NCV slowing over the sulcus as an electrophysiologic indicator of myelin sheath damage. Qualitative assessment of FA maps and T2-weighted images helped identify subjects with conduction slowing with a sensitivity of 80% and 55%, respectively, and a specificity of 83% and 63%.
Conclusion: FA maps can accurately depict even mild peripheral neuropathy and perform better than the current standard of reference, T2-weighted images. DTI may therefore add diagnostic value as a highly sensitive technique for the detection of peripheral neuropathy. © RSNA, 2014.

AB  - Treatment of patients sustaining a complete spinal cord injury remains an unsolved clinical problem because of the lack of spontaneous regeneration of injured central axons. A 38-year-old man sustained traumatic transection of the thoracic spinal cord at upper vertebral level Th9. At 21 months after injury, the patient presented symptoms of a clinically complete spinal cord injury (American Spinal Injury Association class A-ASIA A). One of the patient’s olfactory bulbs was removed and used to derive a culture containing olfactory ensheathing cells and olfactory nerve fibroblasts. Following resection of the glial scar, the cultured cells were transplanted into the spinal cord stumps above and below the injury and the 8-mm gap bridged by four strips of autologous sural nerve. The patient underwent an intense pre- and postoperative neurorehabilitation program. No adverse effects were seen at 19 months postoperatively, and unexpectedly, the removal of the olfactory bulb did not lead to persistent unilateral anosmia. The patient improved from ASIA A to ASIA C. There was improved trunk stability, partial recovery of the voluntary movements of the lower extremities, and an increase of the muscle mass in the left thigh, as well as partial recovery of superficial and deep sensation. There was also some indication of improved visceral sensation and improved vascular autoregulation in the left lower limb. The pattern of recovery suggests functional regeneration of both efferent and afferent long-distance fibers. Imaging confirmed that the grafts had bridged the left side of the spinal cord, where the majority of the nerve grafts were implanted, and neurophysiological examinations confirmed the restitution of the integrity of the corticospinal tracts and the voluntary character of recorded muscle contractions. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical indication of the beneficial effects of transplanted autologous bulbar cells. © 2014 Cognizant Comm. Corp.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alternative use of molecular approaches is promising for improving nerve regeneration in surgical repair of neurotmesis. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of MR imaging in assessment of the enhanced nerve regeneration with toll-like receptor 4 signaling activation in surgical repair of neurotmesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight healthy rats in which the sciatic nerve was surgically transected followed by immediate surgical coaptation received intraperitoneal injection of toll-like receptor 4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (n = 24, study group) or phosphate buffered saline (n = 24, control group) until postoperative day 7. Sequential T2 measurements and gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and sciatic functional index were obtained over an 8-week follow-up period, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and gadofluorine enhancement of the distal nerve stumps were measured and compared between nerves treated with lipopolysaccharide and those treated with phosphate buffered saline. RESULTS: Nerves treated with lipopolysaccharide injection achieved better functional recovery and showed more prominent gadofluorine enhancement and prolonged T2 values during the degenerative phase compared with nerves treated with phosphate buffered saline. T2 values in nerves treated with lipopolysaccharide showed a more rapid return to baseline level than did gadofluorine enhancement. Histology exhibited more macrophage recruitment, faster myelin debris clearance, and more pronounced nerve regeneration in nerves treated with toll-like receptor 4 activation. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced nerve repair with toll-like receptor 4 activation in surgical repair of neurotmesis can be monitored by using gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and T2 relaxation time measurements. T2 relaxation time seems more sensitive than gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging for detecting such improved nerve regeneration.

AB  - Objective: To analyse pelvic autonomous innervation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in comparison with anatomical macroscopic dissection on cadavers. Material and methods: Pelvic MRI was performed in eight adult human cadavers (five men and three women) using a total of four sequences each: T1, T1 fat saturation, T2, diffusion weighed. Images were analysed with segmentation software in order to extract nervous tissue. Key height points of the pelvis autonomous innervation were located in every specimen. Standardised pelvis dissections were then performed. Distances between the same key points and the three anatomical references forming a coordinate system were measured on MRIs and dissections. Concordance (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient) between MRI and dissection was calculated. Results: MRI acquisition allowed an adequate visualization of the autonomous innervation. Comparison between 3D MRI images and dissection showed concordant pictures. The statistical analysis showed a mean difference of less than 1 cm between MRI and dissection measures and a correct concordance correlation coefficient on at least two coordinates for each point. Conclusion: Our acquisition and post-processing method demonstrated that MRI is suitable for detection of autonomous pelvic innervations and can offer a preoperative nerve cartography. • Nerve preservation is a hot topic in pelvic surgery • High resolution MRI can show distal peripheral nerves • Anatomo-radiological comparison shows good correlation between MRI and dissection • 3D reconstructions of pelvic innervation were obtained with an original method • This is a first step towards image-guided pelvic surgery. © 2014 European Society of Radiology.

AB  - Object. Extraspinal sciatica can present unique challenges in clinical diagnosis and management. In this study, the authors evaluated qualitative and quantitative patterns of sciatica-related pathology at the ischial tuberosity on MR neurography (MRN) studies performed for chronic extraspinal sciatica. Methods. Lumbosacral MRN studies obtained in 14 patients at the University of California, San Francisco between 2007 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients had been referred by neurosurgeons or neurologists for chronic unilateral sciatica (≥ 3 months), and the MRN reports described asymmetrical increased T2 signal within the sciatic nerve at the level of the ischial tuberosity. MRN studies were also performed prospectively in 6 healthy volunteers. Sciatic nerve T2 signal intensity (SI) and cross-sectional area at the ischial tuberosity were calculated and compared between the 2 sides in all 20 subjects. The same measurements were also performed at the sciatic notch as an internal reference. Adjacent musculoskeletal pathology was compared between the 2 sides in all subjects. Results. Seven of the 9 patients for whom detailed histories were available had a specific history of injury or trauma near the proximal hamstring preceding the onset of sciatica. Eight of the 14 patients also demonstrated softtissue abnormalities adjacent to the proximal hamstring origin. The remaining 6 had normal muscles, tendons, and marrow in the region of the ischial tuberosity. There was a significant difference in sciatic nerve SI and size between the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides at the level of the ischial tuberosity, with a mean adjusted SI of 1.38 compared with 1.00 (p &lt; 0.001) and a mean cross-sectional nerve area of 0.66 versus 0.54 cm2 (p = 0.002). The control group demonstrated symmetrical adjusted SI and sciatic nerve size. Conclusions. This study suggests that chronic sciatic neuropathy can be seen at the ischial tuberosity in the setting of prior proximal hamstring tendon injury or adjacent soft-tissue abnormalities. Because hamstring tendon injury as a cause of chronic sciatica remains a diagnosis of exclusion, this distinct category of patients has not been described in the radiographic literature and merits special attention from clinicians and radiologists in the management of extraspinal sciatica. Magnetic resonance neurography is useful for evaluating chronic sciatic neuropathy both qualitatively and quantitatively, particularly in patients for whom electromyography and traditional MRI studies are unrevealing. ©AANS, 2014.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to establish dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion in peripheral nerves for determination of blood-nerve permeability (K) and nerve blood volume (NBV) in peripheral neuropathies as compared with healthy controls. METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Forty-three controls (24 women, 19 men; age, 48.7 ± 17.5 years) and 59 patients with peripheral neuropathy (28 women, 31 men; age, 52.7 ± 12.4 years) were examined by a standard protocol including a T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence (time of repetition/time of echo, 4.91/1.64; 10 slices; resolution 0.8 × 0.6 × 3.0 mm). Time - signal intensity analysis was performed by normalizing to pre-bolus arrival and calculating the mean contrast uptake (MCU) for each patient. Further analyses were performed by customized software to calculate K and NBV. Statistical analysis included 2-sided Student's t tests of controls versus patients, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and subgroup analysis of patients according to etiologies of neuropathy. RESULTS: Time-signal intensity analysis showed significantly increased contrast uptake in patients as compared with controls (MCU, 1.29 ± 0.15 vs 1.18 ± 0.08; P < 0.001). This was caused mainly by an increase in K (0.046 ± 0.025 vs 0.026 ± 0.016 min; P < 0.001) and less by an increase in NBV (3.9 ± 2.6 vs 3.0 ± 1.9 mL/100 mL; P = 0.12). This trend was true for all etiologies except entrapment neuropathies. Excluding these, receiver operating characteristic analysis found an area under the curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.89) for MCU and 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.90) for K to discriminate neuropathy from control. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion is a feasible technique to assess K and NBV in peripheral nerves and may be used in future investigations on peripheral neuropathies. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study is to review advances in magnetic resonance (MR)-neurography and nerve-ultrasound for the precise visualization and localization of nerve lesions not only in nerve trauma or mass lesions, but also in entrapment-related and spontaneously occurring intrinsic neuropathies. These advances may improve the understanding and classification of peripheral neuropathies. RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnostic studies of MR-neurography and high-resolution ultrasound in entrapment-neuropathies consistently report accurate determination and localization of symptomatic nerve entrapment. Additionally, the longitudinal sampling of nerve-T2-signal over larger areas of coverage has become technically feasible. With this approach, more complex patterns of spatial lesion dispersion in nonfocal neuropathies could be observed with reliable lesion image contrast at the level of individual nerve fascicles. Imaging detection of fascicular lesions allows for more accurate localization, because fascicular lesion types represent a specific pitfall for clinical-electrophysiological examinations. Fascicular hypoechogenicity of high-resolution ultrasound is the correlate of nerve-T2-signal lesions, but contrast is inferior and difficult to quantify. Therefore, nerve enlargement remains the main diagnostic criterion in high-resolution ultrasound. Diffusion-tensor-MR-neurography provides quantitative estimates of fiber structure, which were shown to correlate with aging and focal entrapment. SUMMARY: High-resolution nerve imaging with extended anatomical coverage is feasible and improves the topographic description of spatial lesion dispersion which is particularly relevant for the discrimination between focal and nonfocal neuropathies.© 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) has hitherto been considered a disease of the peripheral nervous system only, with central nervous system (CNS) involvement largely overlooked. The aim of this study was to investigate any differences in brain structure in subjects with DPN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Thirty-six subjects with type 1 diabetes (No DPN [n = 18], Painful DPN [n = 9], Painless DPN [n = 9]) underwent neurophysiological assessment to quantify the severity of DPN. All subjects, including 18 healthy volunteers (HVs), underwent volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. RESULTS Adjusted peripheral gray matter volume was statistically significantly lower in subjects with painless and painful DPN (mean 599.6 mL [SEM 9.8 mL] and 585.4 mL [10.0 mL], respectively) compared with those with No DPN (626.5 mL [5.7 mL]) and HVs (639.9 mL [7.2 mL]; ANCOVA, P = 0.001). The difference in adjusted peripheral gray matter volume between subjects with No DPN and HVs and those with Painful DPN and Painless DPN was not statistically significant (P = 0.16 and 0.30, respectively). Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed greater localized volume loss in the primary somatosensory cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and cingulate cortex (corrected P > 0.05) in DPN subjects. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to focus on structural changes in the brain associated with DPN. Our findings suggest increased peripheral graymatter volume loss, localized to regions involvedwith somatosensory perception in subjectswith DPN. Thismay have important implications for the long-term prognosis of DPN. © 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Peripheral nervous system (PNS) imaging is usually carried out by ultrasound and MRI.Thanks to its wide availability and excellent spatial resolution, ultrasound is a mature investiga-tion with clearly established indications, particularly in entrapment syndromes and tumors. MRIis generally a second-line examination, which provides decisive additional information thanks toits excellent contrast resolution and its multiplanar abilities. This review describes the currentmethods for imaging the PNS, concentrating on acquisition techniques, normal results and basicpathological semiology. Ongoing and future developments are described in order to underlinethe forthcoming changes in this very dynamic field of musculoskeletal radiology. © 2013 Éditions françaises de radiologie. © 2013 Éditions françaises de radiologie.

AB  - Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging is an emerging magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique for evaluating the microstructure of wellorganized biologic tissues such as muscles and nerves. DT imaging provides information about tissue microstructure by producing three-dimensional maps of water molecule movements. The two main parameters of measurement at DT imaging, fractional anisotropy and the apparent diffusion coefficient, allow quantitation of architectural changes occurring in tissue. These parameters are modified in the presence of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, cervical spine trauma, carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar nerve compression, peripheral nerve tumors, and muscle ischemia. Their alteration may be observed at DT imaging even when no abnormality is seen at conventional MR imaging, a fact that suggests that DT imaging allows the detection of abnormalities at an earlier stage of injury. Experimental studies in animals have shown that DT imaging consistently allows identification of pathophysiologic alterations in tissue that correlate with histologic findings. Tractographic images accurately depict both normal and abnormal diffusion in anatomic structures such as the thigh and pelvic muscles, cervical spine, and lumbar nerves. Patients with chronic diseases also may benefit from follow-up evaluation with DT imaging, although DT imaging sequences must be further adapted to improve the evaluation of specific anatomic regions by reducing artifacts, optimizing spatial resolution, and minimizing acquisition time. Given its proven potential for use in identifying abnormalities that are otherwise identifiable only with electrophysiologic and histopathologic studies, and with future technical improvements, DT imaging could soon become a standard method for early diagnosis, management, and follow-up of disease in the spine, muscles, and peripheral nerves. © RSNA, 2014.

AB  - Purpose To implement high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for visualization and quantification of peripheral nerves in human forearm. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all the study participants. Images were acquired with T1-and T 2-weighted turbo spin echo with/without fat saturation, short tau inversion recovery (STIR). In addition, high spatial resolution (1.0×1.0×3.0 mm3) DTI sequence was optimized for clearly visualizing ulnar, superficial radial and median nerves in the forearm. Maps of the DTI derived indices, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity (λ//) and radial diffusivity (λ⊥) were generated. Results For the first time, the three peripheral nerves, ulnar, superficial radial, and median, were visualized unequivocally on high resolution DTI-derived maps. DTI delineated the forearm nerves more clearly than other sequences. Significant differences in the DTI-derived measures, FA, MD, λ// and λ ⊥, were observed among the three nerves. A strong correlation between the nerve size derived from FA map and T2-weighted images was observed. Conclusion High spatial resolution DTI is superior in identifying and quantifying the median, ulnar, and superficial radial nerves in human forearm. Consistent visualization of small nerves and nerve branches is possible with high spatial resolution DTI these normative data could potentially help in identifying pathology in diseased nerves.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for pathologies of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) through clinical, electrophysiological and morphological evaluation of the median nerve. Methods: The present work was a multilevel prospective study involving 30 subjects, 15 of whom had carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and 15 healthy controls. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation through administration of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), electroneurography (ENG), 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging with DTI, and calculation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at the flexor retinaculum. Tractography was also performed for three-dimensional reconstruction of the route of the median nerve through the carpal tunnel. The degree of functional impairment was compared with the anatomical damage to the median nerve according to ENG and DTI. Results: FA and ADC were significantly correlated with ENG parameters of CTS and BCTQ data. Mean FA and ADC values in the CTS patients were 0.359±0.06 and 1.866±0.050×10-3mm2/s, respectively, vs 0.59±0.014 and 1.395±0.035×10-3mm2/s, respectively, in the controls. FA was decreased and ADC increased in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: DTI parameters were clearly confirmed by both clinical and ENG data and, therefore, may be used for the diagnosis of CTS. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - The goals of the present study were to demonstrate the ability of high-resolution ultrasonography to delineate normal nerve fascicles within or around peripheral nerve sheath tumors (NSTs). A blinded examiner evaluated 2 patients with symptomatic upper limb NSTs with high-resolution ultrasonography performed in the perioperative suite using a portable ultrasonography system. Ultrasonographic examinations located the tumor mass and identified the normal nerve fascicles associated with the mass. The locations of normal nerve tissue were mapped and correlated with results of MR tractography, operative inspection, and intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring. The study demonstrated a close correlation between normal nerve fascicles identified by ultrasonography, MR tractography, and intraoperative electrophysiological mapping. In particular, ultrasonographic examinations accurately identified the surface regions of the tumor without overlying normal nerve tissue. These preliminary data suggest that preoperative ultrasonographic examinations may provide valuable information, supplementary to the information obtained from intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring. Identification of normal nerve tissue prior to surgery may provide additional information regarding the risk of iatrogenic nerve injury during percutaneous tumor biopsy or open resection of the tumor and may also aid in selecting the optimum surgical approach. ©AANS, 2014.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the role of MR imaging in neurotmesis combined with surgical repair and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Methods: Forty-eight rats received subepineurial microinjection of the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS, n=24) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n=24) immediately after surgical repair of the transected sciatic nerve. Sequential fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging and quantitative T2 measurements were obtained at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after surgery, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and histological quantification of the distal stumps were measured and compared. Results: The distal stumps of transected nerves treated with LPS or PBS both showed persistent enlargement and hyperintense signal. T2 values of the distal stumps showed a rapid rise to peak level followed by a rapid decline pattern in nerves treated with LPS, while exhibiting a slow rise to peak value followed by a slow decline in nerves treated with PBS. Nerves treated with LPS exhibited more prominent macrophage recruitment, faster myelin debris clearance and more pronounced nerve regeneration. Conclusion: Nerves treated with TLR4 activation had a characteristic pattern of T2 value change over time. Longitudinal T2 measurements can be used to detect the enhanced repair effect associated with TLR4 activation in the surgical repair of neurotmesis. Key points: • TLR4 activation had additional beneficial effects on neurotmesis beyond surgical repair. • TLR4 activation had a characteristic time course of T2 values. • T2 measurements can help detect beneficial effects with TLR4 activation. © 2014 European Society of Radiology.

AB  - PURPOSE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the leading cause of death for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Identification of hypermetabolic lesions on PET may help identify patients at risk for MPNST. The objective of this study was to identify clinical and MRI-derived variables that predicted increased metabolic activity of neurofibromas in NF1 patients as determined by PET. METHODS: This prospective study included NF1 patients with neurofibromas of 5 cm in diameter or greater. All patients underwent whole-body MRI and F-FDG PET imaging. Tumor volume was calculated from the MR scans using a semiautomated 3-dimensional segmentation method. SUVmax's were calculated to quantify metabolic activity. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship among SUVmax, tumor volume, location (extremity vs trunk), type (plexiform vs circumscribed), depth (superficial vs deep), patient age, and whole-body tumor burden. RESULTS: A total of 311 neurofibromas were identified in 19 NF1 patients (mean age, 38 years; range, 19-58 years). One extreme outlier was excluded from analysis. Whole-body tumor volumes ranged from 0.4 to 1182.4 mL. Fifty of 310 tumors were FDG-avid on PET (16%) with median SUVmax of 2.2 (range, 0.4-9.6). Metabolic activity (SUVmax >2.5) correlated with tumor location (deep > superficial, trunk > extremity) in tumors with PET avidity. CONCLUSIONS: In NF1 patients with neurofibromas of 5 cm or greater, the majority of internal tumors are not metabolically active on PET. Tumors with increased metabolic activity as defined by SUVmax greater than 2.5 (ie, suggestive of MPNST) are more likely to be deep and located within the trunk. © 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) and ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) are autosomal recessive ataxias caused by mutations in genes involved in maintaining DNA integrity. Lifespan in AT is greatly shortened (20s-30s) due to increased susceptibility to malignancies (leukemia/lymphoma). Lifespan in AOA2 is uncertain. We describe a woman with variant AT with two novel mutations in ATM (IVS14 + 2 T > G and 5825C > T, p.A1942V) who died at age 48 with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Her mutations are associated with an unusually long life for AT and with a cancer rarely associated with that disease. We also describe two siblings with AOA2, heterozygous for two novel mutations in senataxin (3 bp deletion c.343-345 and 1398 T > G, p.I466M) who have survived into their 70s, allowing us to characterize the longitudinal course of AOA2. In contrast to AT, we show that persons with AOA2 can experience a prolonged lifespan with considerable motor disability. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chronic immune-mediated neuropathies show high clinical variability. Diagnosis is based on clinical and neurophysiological studies, but recently ultrasound (US) of peripheral nerves has been shown to provide useful morphological information. US has already been shown to crucially influence diagnosis and clinical care in entrapment neuropathies, in traumatic nerve lesions and in tumors. The role of US in the evaluation of polyneuropathies is still not clearly defined, but increasing attention has recently been focused on the immune-mediated neuropathies and specific US measures (namely the intra- and inter-nerve cross-sectional area variability) have been developed. The aim of the current paper is to make a review of the available nerve US studies and provide data from personal observations in the most common chronic immune-mediated neuropathies. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Intraneural perineuriomas are rare tumors of the peripheral nerves with unique immunohistochemical findings. In this report, we highlight the clinical and imaging findings of an adolescent male with histologically proven intraneural perineurioma involving multiple nerves. The salient features included a clinically progressive course, imaging evidence of involvement of long segments of multiple nerves, enlargement of individual fascicles within the affected nerves, and intense contrast enhancement of the enlarged fascicles. The identification of enlarged fascicles with intense contrast enhancement within the affected and distended nerve segments may aid in distinguishing intraneural perineurioma from other tumors affecting the peripheral nerves. © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis (NF) comprises two distinct genetic disorders - neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 (NF1 and NF2) - in which affected individuals develop both benign and malignant tumours. NF1 results from germline mutations in the NF1 gene that encodes neurofibromin, while NF2 results from germline mutations in the NF2 gene that encodes merlin (or schwannomin). The major tumour types arising in individuals with NF1 include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, and gliomas, whereas NF2 is characterized by the formation of schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. With the identification of the NF1 and NF2 genes and the generation of robust preclinical mouse models of NF-associated neoplasms, novel treatments that specifically target the growth control pathways deregulated in these tumours have been discovered, some of which are now being tested in clinical trials in individuals with NF1 and NF2. In this Review, we will highlight the key clinical features of NF1 and NF2 and the advances in future clinical management based on an improved understanding of the function of the NF1 and NF2 genes and the development of small-animal models. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate median nerve structure in patients with recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to relate DTI changes to anatomical MRI and to measures of median nerve function. Methods: Median nerve structure was quantified according to DTI in patients with recurrent CTS and in healthy controls of similar age. Anatomical MRI was used to identify the presence of nerve compression and fibrosis. Median nerve function was measured using electromyography, a force-tracking task (accuracy of precision grip control) and clinical measures. Results: Patients showed reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), reduced axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) along the median nerve compared with controls (P < 0.001). Patients with endoneural fibrosis had the greatest reductions in ADC and in RD. ADC and AD correlated positively with nerve conduction velocity (R = 0.54 and R = 0.68, respectively) and fractional anisotropy correlated negatively with error during force-tracking (R = -0.58). Conclusions: A specific pattern of DTI changes in the median nerve was identified in patients with recurrent CTS. Fibrosis may be underlying these structural changes. The correlations with nerve conduction velocity and accuracy of force control suggest that DTI is a promising technique in the study of median nerve structure in recurrent CTS. © 2013 European Society of Radiology.

AB  - Objective To explore the feasibility of longitudinally measuring acute traction injury to the sciatic nerve using 1.5 T clinical MRI scanner of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to analyze the associations of the measurements [regarding fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), eigenvalue (λ|| and λ âŠ¥)] with limb function and pathology. Materials and methods Acute traction injuries to the sciatic nerve were created in the right hind limbs of 32 New Zealand white rabbits, the left hind limbs were chosen as sham operation nerves. MRI scans were performed at intervals from pre-operation through 8 weeks post-operation follow up. Scanning sequences included T2WI, STIR, and single shot spin echo DTI with single shot EPI acquisition (SE-DTI-SSEPI). Parameters of FA, ADC, axial diffusivity (λ||) and radial diffusivity (λ âŠ¥) were then calculated from the DTI. The limb functions and pathologic changes were evaluated and compared. Results Diffusion Tensor Tractography (DTT) only revealed the proximal portion of the injured nerves 1-3 days after traction injury but did not reveal the nerve of the distal and traction portions at all. Nerve fibers of the distal and traction portions were not revealed by DTT until after the 1st week. They were elongated gradually and recovered almost to the normal at 8th week. The value of FA and λâŠ¥of the injured nerves, which varied in different portions, were significantly different between the traction injury nerves and the sham operation nerves, whereas the value of ADC and λ|| were not significantly different. The curve lines of FA value-time for the proximal, traction and distal portions of the injured nerve correlated well to the functional and pathological changes of the limb affected, while the DTI parameters did not change that much in the sham-operated nerves. Conclusions DTI obtained on a 1.5 T clinical MRI scanner can demonstrate early abnormal changes following traction injury to the sciatic nerve in rabbits. The curve lines of FA-time and λâŠ¥-time for nerve traction injury are consistent with the pathological and functional changes of the limb affected. DTI may thus be a sensitive and reliable method to evaluate degeneration and regeneration of the nerve after traction injury. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Tuberculosis is among the oldest and most devastating infectious diseases worldwide. Nearly one third of the world's population has active or latent disease, resulting in 1.5 million deaths annually. Central nervous system involvement, while rare, is the most severe form of tuberculosis. Manifestations include tuberculoma and tuberculous meningitis, with the majority of cases occurring in children and immunocompromised patients. Despite advancements in imaging and laboratory diagnostics, tuberculomas of the central nervous system remain a diagnostic challenge due to their insidious nature and nonspecific findings. On imaging studies tuberculous meningitis is characterized by diffuse basal enhancement, but tuberculomas may be indistinguishable from neoplasms. Early diagnosis is imperative, since clinical outcomes are largely dependent on timely treatment. Stereotactic biopsy with histopathological analysis can provide a definitive diagnosis, but is only recommended when non-invasive methods are inconclusive. Standard medical treatment includes rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin or ethambutol. In cases of drug resistance, revision of the treatment regimen with second-line agents is recommended over the addition of a single drug to the first-line regimen. Advances in genomics have identified virulent strains of tuberculosis and are improving our understanding of host susceptibility. Neurosurgical referral is advised for patients with elevated intracranial pressure, seizures, or brain or spinal cord compression. This review synthesizes pertinent findings in the literature surrounding central nervous system tuberculoma in an effort to highlight recent advances in pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder, caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, located on chromosome band 17q11.2. In 1988, the National Institutes of Health created specific criteria for the diagnosis of NF1. Four cardinal criteria are assessed through ophthalmological screening: Lisch nodules, optic pathway glioma, a distinctive osseous lesion (sphenoid dysplasia), and the (orbital) plexiform neurofibroma. NF1 patients are prone to the development of central and peripheral nervous system tumors. Especially young children are at risk for growing optic pathway gliomas that can threaten their sight. From an early age, children with NF1 undergo regular ophthalmological examinations. Little is known about the natural progress of these clinical features and the guidelines for screening and follow-up are controversial. Several questions remain unanswered. Conclusion: Most of these questions could be solved by better understanding of the natural history of optic pathway gliomas. There is a tendency towards using vision as a primary objective in clinical treatment trials; this way we can evaluate new treatment strategies and focus specifically on visual evolution so we will be able to select even more carefully which patient would benefit treatment. For future clinical trials, a standardized visual acuity assessment protocol is therefore mandatory. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Characteristic clinical manifestations of AFD such as acroparesthesias, angiokeratoma, corneal opacity, hypo/ and anhidrosis, gastrointestinal symptoms, renal and cardiac dysfunctions can occur in male and female patients, although heterozygous females with AFD usually seem to be less severely affected. The most prominent CNS manifestations consist of cerebrovascular events such as transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and (recurrent) strokes. For the most part, CNS complications in AFD have been attributed to cerebral vasculopathy, including anatomical abnormalities. The natural history of Fabry patients includes transitory cerebral ischaemia and strokes, even in very young persons of both genders. The mechanism is partly due to vascular endothelial accumulation of Gb-3. White matter lesions (WML) on occur MRI. Both males and females can be safely treated with enzyme replacement; and thus screening for Fabry disease of young stroke populations should be considered. There are, however, no hard data of treatment effect on mortality and morbidity. Stroke in Anderson-Fabry disease study of 721 patients with cryptogenic stroke, aged 18-55 years, showed a high prevalence of Fabry disease in this group: 5% (21/432) of men and 3% (7/289) of women. Combining results of both sexes showed that 4% of young patients with stroke of previously unknown cause had Fabry disease, corresponding to about 1-2% of the general population of young stroke patients. Cerebral micro- and macro-vasculopathy have been described in Fabry disease. Neuronal globotriaosylceramide accumulation in selective cortical and brain stem areas including the hippocampus has been reported by autopsy studies in FD, but clinical surrogates as well as the clinical relevance of these findings have not been investigated so far. Another Neurologic hallmark of Fabry disease (FD) includes small fiber neuropathy as well as cerebral micro- and macroangiopathy with premature stroke. Cranial MRI shows progressive white matter lesions (WML) at an early age, increased signal intensity in the pulvinar, and tortuosity and dilatation of the larger vessels. Conventional MRI shows a progressive load of white matter lesions (WMLs) due to cerebral vasculopathy in the course of FD. Another study has been conducted to quantify brain structural changes in clinically affected male and female patients with FD. The peripheral neuropathy in Fabry disease manifests as neuropathic pain, reduced cold and warm sensation and possibly gastrointestinal disturbances. Patients with Fabry disease begin having pain towards the end of the first decade of life or during puberty. Children as young as 6 years of age have complained of pain often associated with febrile illnesses with reduced heat and exercise tolerance. The patients describe the pain as burning that is often associated with deep ache or paresthesiae. Some patients also have joint pain. A high proportion of patients with Fabry disease is at increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression and neuropsychological deficits. Due to both somatic and psychological impairment, health-related quality of life (QoL) is considerably reduced in patients with Fabry disease. Targeted screening for Fabry disease among young individuals with stroke seems to disclose unrecognized cases and may therefore very well be recommended as routine in the future. Furthermore, ischemic stroke is related to inflammation and arterial stiffness and no study had addressed this relationship in patients with AF disease and cerebrovascular disease, so this topic could represent a possible future research line. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Objective: To assess the outcomes and safety after CTguided percutaneous sacroplasty in patients with painful sacral insufficiency fractures or pathologic sacral lesions. Methods: A retrospective multicenter analysis of consecutive patients undergoing CT-guided sacroplasty for painful sacral insufficiency fractures or sacral lesions was undertaken. The inclusion criteria consisted of severe sacral pain not responding to conservative medical management with imaging evidence of unilateral or bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures or lesions. Outcome measures included hospitalization status (inpatient or outpatient), pre-treatment and posttreatment visual analog scale (VAS) scores, analgesic use and complications. Patients were followed at approximately 1 month and for at least 1 year after their sacroplasty procedure. Results: Two hundred and forty-three patients were included in the study, 204 with painful sacral insufficiency fractures and 39 with symptomatic sacral lesions. The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.2±1.1 was significantly improved after sacroplasty to 1.9±1.7 in patients with sacral insufficiency fractures (p < 0.001). The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.0±0.9 in patients with sacral lesions was significantly improved after sacroplasty to 2.6±2.4 (p < 0.001). There were no major complications or procedure-related deaths. One patient who was treated for a sacral insufficiency fracture experienced radicular pain due to local extravasation of cement that subsequently required surgical decompression for symptomatic relief. Conclusions: CT-guided percutaneous sacroplasty is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of painful sacral insufficiency fractures or lesions. It is associated with prompt and durable pain relief and should be considered as an effective treatment option in this patient population.

AB  - Objective To prospectively evaluate the usefulness of a newly developed high-resolution three-dimensional diffusion-weighted imaging method, turbo field-echo with diffusion-sensitized driven-equilibrium (TFE-DSDE) in diagnosing middle-ear cholesteatoma by comparing it to conventional single-shot echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (SS-EP DWI). Materials and methods Institutional review board approval and informed consent from all participants were obtained. We studied 30 patients with preoperatively suspected acquired cholesteatoma. Each patient underwent an MR examination including both SS-EP DWI and DSDE-TFE using a 3.0 T MR scanner. Images of the 30 patients (60 temporal bones including 30 with and 30 without cholesteatoma) were reviewed by two independent neuroradiologists. The confidence level for the presence of cholesteatoma was graded on a scale of 0-2 (0 = definite absence, 1 = equivocal, 2 = definite presence). Interobserver agreement as well as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detection were assessed for the two reviewers. Results Excellent interobserver agreement was shown for TFE-DSDE (κ = 0.821) whereas fair agreement was obtained for SS-EP DWI (κ = 0.416). TFE-DSDE was associated with significantly higher sensitivity (83.3%) and accuracy (90.0%) compared to SS-EP DWI (sensitivity = 35.0%, accuracy = 66.7%; p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in specificity (96.7% for TFE-DSDE, 98.3% for SS-EP DWI) Conclusion With increased spatial resolution and reduced susceptibility artifacts, TFE-DSDE improves the accuracy in diagnosing acquired middle ear cholesteatomas compared to SS-EP DWI. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The corticoreticular pathway (CRP) innervates the proximal muscles of extremities and axial muscles; therefore, it is involved in postural control and gait. We report on a patient who exhibited proximal weakness due to a CRP injury, which was evaluated using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). METHODS: A 62-year-old male patient who had been injured in a traffic accident underwent conservative management for a contusional hemorrhage in the right frontotemporal lobes, and a subdural and epidural hematoma in the right temporoparietal lobes. The patient exhibited right proximal weakness (shoulder: 3+, hip: 3+) at two weeks after onset. Findings on brain MRI revealed encephalomalactic lesions in both frontal lobes. RESULTS: Findings on DTT of the left CRP showed discontinuation at the midbrain level; in contrast, the integrities of the corticospinal tract in both hemispheres were maintained from the cerebral cortex to the medulla along the known pathway of the corticospinal tract. CONCLUSION: The proximal weakness of the right shoulder and hip observed in this patient appeared to be attributed to injury of the left CRP. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - The identification of strategies by which the central nervous system (CNS) can transform itself in response to injury has incited the systematic exploration of methods to enhance neurological recovery after CNS injury. Several pharmaceuticals have been shown to promote such recovery; however, more rigorous clinical trials are necessary to establish their clinical relevance. The major impediment for these strategies in the clinical arena is the astounding heterogeneity surrounding neuroplasticity and regeneration. Tolerance to injury and varied rates of recovery are likely governed by genetic and environmental factors that remain largely elusive. The extraordinary complexity of the neural networks in the CNS impedes the assessment of 'plain' pharmacological interventions in therapeutic trials. 'Proof-of-principle' studies of pharmacological interventions enhancing neuroplasticity or regeneration may therefore at first focus on surrogate markers, such as functional MRI, magnetoencephalography and diffusion tensor imaging, or investigate seemingly more uniform systems, such as spinal cord injuries. The discovery that experimental adult CNS lesions can essentially regenerate has rejected the conviction that adult axon injury is always permanent and spurred research into determining whether the circumstances under which such regeneration occurs can be created in human CNS injury. The hostility of the microenvironment preventing axonal regrowth has been linked to key molecular targets involving myelin-associated factors and glial scar components. While the mechanisms involved are better understood now and potential therapeutic targets are identified, the crucial question whether manipulating the molecular regulation of axonal repair is feasible and will benefit patients remains uncertain. While factual repair of brain tissue may still be years away, research into the mechanisms of adaptation after brain injury offers more tangible return on the short run. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Evidence suggests that inflammation, an innate immune response facilitating recovery from injury and pathogenic invasion, is positively associated with age-related cognitive decline and may play a role in risk for dementia. Physiological pathways linking the peripheral immune and central nervous systems are outlined, and studies linking inflammation with neurocognitive function are overviewed. We also present recent studies from our laboratory showing that midlife inflammation is related to cognitive function and brain morphology. Finally, potential implications for treatment, future directions, and limitations are discussed. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia, painful trigeminal neuropathy, and painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are chronic orofacial pain conditions that are thought to have fundamentally different etiologies. Trigeminal neuralgia and neuropathy are thought to arise from damage to or pressure on the trigeminal nerve, whereas TMD results primarily from peripheral nociceptor activation. This study sought to assess the volume and microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in these 3 conditions. In 9 neuralgia, 18 neuropathy, 20 TMD, and 26 healthy controls, the trigeminal root entry zone was selected on high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and the volume (mm3) calculated. Additionally, using diffusion-tensor images (DTIs), the mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values of the trigeminal nerve root were calculated. Trigeminal neuralgia patients displayed a significant (47%) decrease in nerve volume but no change in DTI values. Conversely, trigeminal neuropathy subjects displayed a significant (40%) increase in nerve volume but again no change in DTI values. In contrast, TMD subjects displayed no change in volume or DTI values. The data suggest that the changes occurring within the trigeminal nerve are not uniform in all orofacial pain conditions. These structural and volume changes may have implications in diagnosis and management of different forms of chronic orofacial pain. Perspective: This study reveals that neuropathic orofacial pain conditions are associated with changes in trigeminal nerve volume, whereas non-neuropathic orofacial pain is not associated with any change in nerve volume. © 2013 by the American Pain Society.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the most common heritable form of cognitive impairment, is caused by epigenetic silencing of the fragile X (. FMR1) gene owing to large expansions (>200 repeats) of a non-coding CGG-repeat element. Smaller, so-called premutation expansions (55-200 repeats) can cause a family of neurodevelopmental phenotypes (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, seizure disorder) and neurodegenerative (fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome [FXTAS]) phenotypes through an entirely distinct molecular mechanism involving increased FMR1 mRNA production and toxicity. Results of basic cellular, animal, and human studies have helped to elucidate the underlying RNA toxicity mechanism, while clinical research is providing a more nuanced picture of the range of clinical manifestations. Advances of knowledge on both mechanistic and clinical fronts are driving new approaches to targeted treatment, but two important necessities are emerging: to define the extent to which the mechanisms contributing to FXTAS also contribute to other neurodegenerative and medical disorders, and to redefine FXTAS in view of its differing presentations and associated features. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The syndrome of subacute simultaneous peripheral neuropathy and bilateral optic neuropathy is known to occur in tropical countries, probably due to malnutrition or toxicity, but not often seen in developed countries. We report seven patients in London who were not malnourished or alcoholic, and in whom no clear cause was found. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the case notes and arranged some further investigations. Results: All patients developed peripheral and bilateral optic neuropathy within 6 months. Patients were aged 30-52, and all of Jamaican birth and race but lived in the UK. Most had subacute, painful ataxic sensory axonal neuropathy or neuronopathy, some with myelopathy. Nerve conduction studies revealed minor demyelinating features in two cases. The optic neuropathy was symmetrical, subacute and monophasic, usually with marked reduction in visual acuity. CSF protein concentration was usually elevated but other laboratory investigations were normal. Patients showed only modest improvement at follow-up. Conclusion: These patients share a common clinical and electrophysiological phenotype, age, ethnicity and elevated CSF protein, but otherwise normal laboratory investigations. The syndrome is a cause of significant morbidity in young people. The cause remains uncertain despite thorough investigation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diabetic 'peripheral' neuropathy (DPN) is one of the common sequelae to the development of both type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Neuropathy has a major negative impact on quality of life. Abnormalities in both peripheral vasculature and nerve function are well documented and, in addition, evidence is emerging regarding changes within the central nervous system (CNS) that are concomitant with the presence of DPN. The often-resistant nature of DPN to medical treatment highlights the need to understand the role of the CNS in neuropathic symptomatology and progression, as this may modulate therapeutic approaches. Advanced neuroimaging techniques, especially those that can provide quantitative measures of structure and function, can provide objective markers of CNS status. With that comes great potential for not only furthering our understanding of involvement of the CNS in neuropathic etiology but also most importantly aiding the development of new and more effective, targeted, analgesic interventions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Exploring the pathways of manganese (Mn2+) transport in the nervous system becomes of interest as many recent studies use Mn2+ as a neural tract tracer in mammals. In this study, we performed manganese enhanced MRI (MEMRI) at 17.2T on the buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica. The main advantage of this model over mammalian systems is that it contains networks of large identified neurons. Using Mn2+ retrograde transport along selected nerves, we first validated the mapping of motor neurons' axonal projections into peripheral nerves, previously obtained from optical imaging (Morton et al., 1991). This protocol was found not to alter the functional properties of the neuronal network. Second, we compared the Mn2+ dynamics inside the ganglia in the presence or absence of chemical stimulation. We found that 2h of stimulation with the modulatory transmitter dopamine increased the extent of areas of intermediate signal enhancement caused by manganese accumulation. In the absence of dopamine, an overall decrease of the enhanced areas in favor of non-enhanced areas was found, as a result of natural Mn2+ washout. This supports the hypothesis that, upon activation, Mn2+ is released from labeled neurons and captured by other, initially unlabeled, neurons. However, the latter could not be clearly identified due to lack of sensitivity and multiplicity of possible pathways starting from labeled cells. Nonetheless, the Aplysia buccal ganglia remain a well-suited model for attempting to visualize Mn2+ transport from neuron to neuron upon activation, as well as for studying dopaminergic modulation in a motor network. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality. ICH results in the formation of hematoma that affects not only the primary site of injury but also the remote regions. In fact, hematoma can extend via perivascular spaces (also called Virchow-Robin spaces, VRS) and perineurium in an animal model of ICH. In the present study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) to investigate the characteristics of the perivascular and perineural extensions of hematomas in patients with ICH. A total of 20 ICH patients without secondary subarachnoid and secondary intraventricular hemorrhages were recruited. Brain MRI scans, including SWI, T1, and T2-weighted images, were performed between 17 h to 7 days after the onset of ICH. MRI with SWI revealed that paramagnetic substances spread along the VRS or the perineurium. Such distribution could cause the formation of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). However, the distribution of remote hemorrhagic lesions varied, depending on the size and location of the original hematoma. The unenhanced CT scans of the 20 patients did not show any hyperdensity around the blood vessels and nerve tracts outside the hematoma. These results indicate the perivascular and perineural extensions of hematomas in patients with ICH, which is formed by the leakage of the original hematoma via the VRS or perineurium. We also provide a new explanation for the series of pathological processes involved in ICH, including the remote effects of hematoma and the formation of CMBs in patients with ICH. © 2013 Tohoku University Medical Press.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis: Longstanding diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the risk of complications affecting the central nervous system. The aims were to study brain volume and cortical thickness in regional brain areas in DM patients and to correlate the findings with relevant clinical data. Methods: 15 patients with longstanding (average 24.6 years) type 1 DM and 20 healthy controls were studied in a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. Using an automated surface based cortical segmentation method, cortical thickness was assessed in anatomical regions including total and lobe-wise grey and white matter volumes. Also morphological changes were evaluated. Results: No differences between patients and controls were found in regard to number of white matter lesions (P=0.50), grey and white matter volumes (P=0.25) and overall cortical thickness (P=0.64). Subanalysis revealed exclusively reduced cortical thickness of the postcentral (P=0.03) and superior parietal gyrus (P=0.008) in patients. The cortical thickness of these regions was not associated with diabetes duration, age at diabetes onset or to HbA1c (all P>0.08). Patients with peripheral neuropathy showed reduced right postcentral gyrus cortical thickness compared to patients without peripheral neuropathy (P=0.02). Conclusions: Patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed cortical thinning involving sensory related areas, even though no overall macrostructural brain alterations were detected. This could possibly have underlying functional significance since cortical thinning was associated to presence of peripheral neuropathy. The absence of universal macrostructural changes might illustrate that more pronounced brain pathology is likely to be preceded by more subtle microstructural changes as reported in other studies. © J.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Schwannomas are typically benign tumors that occur sporadically, in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), or in an entity called " schwannomatosis." Schwannomatosis patients develop multiple schwannomas without involvement of the vestibular apparatus. Geneticists, neurologists, and pathologists have recognized that schwannomatosis is distinct from NF2, but schwannomatosis remains unfamiliar to many radiologists. This article reviews the current medical literature, highlighting the similarities and differences between the schwannomatosis and NF2 phenotypes, genotypes, clinical manifestations, management considerations, and imaging findings. CONCLUSION. Imaging plays a critical role in diagnosing schwannomatosis, and a basic understanding of this syndrome is of interest to diagnostic radiologists. Moreover, it is imperative that radiologists be able to differentiate schwannomatosis from NF2 on imaging because there are significant differences in the management of these two diseases and clinical outcomes for affected patients. © American Roentgen Ray Society.

AB  - MR-based brain imaging technologies provide a suite of functional and structural metrics that can be used to test hypotheses about the CNS mechanisms underlying pain perception and chronification, from a cellular level to a systems level. Two types of functional MRI discussed in this review provide insight into pain mechanisms: stimulus-evoked fMRI and task-free ("resting state") fMRI. The former can assess how the brain responds to noxious or non-noxious stimuli normally or in a chronic pain state as a window into understanding pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. The latter can assess functional connectivity reflecting synchronous ultra-slow frequency oscillation between brain areas. This provides insight into how brain areas work together as networks to produce pain and how these networks may be modified due to chronic pain. Perfusion MR (e.g., arterial spin labeling) can also provide task-free information pertaining to ongoing brain activity that may reflect spontaneous (ongoing) chronic pain. Structural MR techniques can be used to delineate gray and white matter abnormalities and markers of neuroinflammation associated with chronic pains. Functional and structural MRI findings point to brain and peripheral nerve abnormalities in patients with chronic pain, some of which are pre-existing and others that develop with prolonged pain (and related neuroinflammation) over time. Recent studies indicate that some structural brain abnormalities associated with chronic pain are reversible following effective pain treatment. These data together with findings from studies of individual differences suggest that some chronic pains arise from a combination of pre-existing vulnerabilities and sustained abnormal input. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) has been reported as one of the most common peripheral neuropathies. Carpal tunnel segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images is important for the evaluation of CTS. To date, manual segmentation, which is time-consuming and operator dependent, remains the most common approach for the analysis of the carpal tunnel structure. Therefore, we propose a new knowledge-based method for automatic segmentation of the carpal tunnel from MR images. The proposed method first requires the segmentation of the carpal tunnel from the most proximally cross-sectional image. Three anatomical features of the carpal tunnel are detected by watershed and polygonal curve fitting algorithms to automatically initialize a deformable model as close to the carpal tunnel in the given image as possible. The model subsequently deforms toward the tunnel boundary based on image intensity information, shape bending degree, and the geometry constraints of the carpal tunnel. After the deformation process, the carpal tunnel in the most proximal image is segmented and subsequently applied to a contour propagation step to extract the tunnel contours sequentially from the remaining cross-sectional images. MR volumes from 15 subjects were included in the validation experiments. Compared with the ground truth of two experts, our method showed good agreement on tunnel segmentations by an average margin of error within 1 mm and dice similarity coefficient above 0.9. © 2012 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.

AB  - Lower back pain is a common problem frequently encountered without specific biomarkers that correlate well with an individual patient's pain generators. MRI quantification of diffusion and T2 relaxation properties may provide novel insight into the mechanical and inflammatory changes that occur in the lumbosacral nerve roots in patients with lower back pain. Accurate imaging of the spinal nerve roots is difficult because of their small caliber and oblique course in all three planes. Two-dimensional in-plane imaging of the lumbosacral nerve roots requires oblique coronal imaging with large field of view (FOV) in both dimensions, resulting in severe geometric distortions using single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) techniques. The present work describes initial success using a reduced-FOV single-shot spin-echo EPI acquisition to obtain in-plane diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 mapping of the bilateral lumbar nerve roots at the L4 level of healthy subjects, minimizing partial volume effects, breathing artifacts and geometric distortions. A significant variation in DTI and T2 mapping metrics is also reported along the course of the normal nerve root. The fractional anisotropy is statistically significantly lower in the dorsal root ganglia (0.287±0.068) than in more distal regions in the spinal nerve (0.402±0.040) (p&lt;10-5). The T2 relaxation value is statistically significantly higher in the dorsal root ganglia (78.0±11.9ms) than in more distal regions in the spinal nerve (59.5±7.4ms) (p&lt;10-5). The quantification of nerve root DTI and T2 properties using the proposed methodology may identify the specific site of any degenerative and inflammatory changes along the nerve roots of patients with lower back pain. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia is a syndrome due to dysfunctional hyperactivity of the trigeminal nerve, and is characterized by a sudden, usually unilateral, recurrent lancinating pain arising from one or more divisions of the nerve. The most accepted pathogenetic mechanism for trigeminal neuralgia is compression of the nerve at its dorsal root entry zone or in its distal course. In this paper, we report four cases with trigeminal neuralgia due to an unknown mechanism after an intracranial intervention. The onset of trigeminal neuralgia after surgical interventions that are unrelated to the trigeminal nerve suggests that in patients with greater individual susceptibility, nerve contact with the vascular structure due to postoperative pressure and changes in cerebrospinal fluid flow may cause the onset of pain.

AB  - Soft-tissue masses in children may be inflammatory, reactive, or neoplastic. The distribution of soft-tissue tumors of the extremities in children is different fromthat in adults. Benign tumors aremuch more common than soft-tissue sarcomas. Vascular lesions are the most common benign tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common sarcoma in the pediatric population. The imaging characteristics often are nonspecific, and the diagnosis consists of putting together the clinical, imaging, and pathologic findings. The principles of diagnosis, clinical examination, imaging, and pathologic findings in some common pediatric soft-tissue tumors of the extremities are presented. Some of the more recent advances in imaging and pathology also are highlighted. 1940-7041 © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health.

AB  - Damage to the mutual and delicate articular relationships of the foot may lead to functional failure. A painful foot can be the heralding sign of inflammatory, metabolic or degenerative rheumatic disease that may cause severe disability if left untreated. Healthy tendons are brilliant white in colour, are fibroelastic in texture and can withstand huge mechanical loads. Pathological tendons are characterised by changes in cellular function, rupture of collagen bundles, increased production of the proteoglycan-water matrix and neurovascular proliferation. According to the underlying disease, tendinopathies may present with pain of variable duration and intensity and with functional impairment, or they may be an asymptomatic finding on imaging techniques. Pain is the most common presenting symptom in the inflammatory rheumatic diseases of the ankle and the foot and usually precedes ultrasound or radiographic changes; pain results from inflammatory changes of the synovia and soft tissue structures including bursae, tendons, fascias and peripheral nerves. The management of tendinopathies in inflammatory and non-inflammatory rheumatic patients includes "articular economy," pharmacological treatment, foot orthotics, cryotherapy, instrumental physiotherapy, rehabilitation and physical. This review highlights the differences between tendinopathies occurring in non-inflammatory rheumatic disorders compared to those appearing in the course of inflammatory rheumatic disorders and defines a conservative management framework that non-rheumatologists (orthopaedic surgeons) and rheumatologists could adhere for the management of foot tendinopathies. © 2012 Clinical Rheumatology.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the value of reduced field of view (rFOV) imaging in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of the lumbar nerve roots at 3 T from the perspective of future clinical trials. Methods: DTI images of the lumbar nerves were obtained in eight healthy volunteers, with and without the rFOV technique. Non-coplanar excitation and refocusing pulses associated with outer volume suppression (OVS) were used to achieve rFOV imaging. Tractography was performed. A visual evaluation of image quality was made by two observers, both senior musculoskeletal radiologists. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured in L5 and S1 roots. Results: rFOV images of the L5 and S1 roots were assessed as being superior to full FOV (fFOV) images. Image quality was rated as good to excellent by both observers. Interobserver agreement was good. No significant difference was found in FA and ADC measurements of the L5 or S1 roots. On the contrary, only poor-quality images could be obtained with fFOV imaging as major artefacts were present. Conclusion: The rFOV approach was essential to achieve high-quality DTI imaging of lumbar nerve roots on 3-T MRI. Key Points: • Diffusion tensor 3-T MR imaging of lumbar nerve roots creates severe artefacts. • A reduced field of view drastically reduces artefacts, thereby improving image quality. • Good-quality tractography images can even be obtained with rFOV imaging. • rFOV DTI is better than fFOV DTI for clinical studies. © 2012 European Society of Radiology.

AB  - MRI is currently the best imaging modality to assess myelin maturation in the human brain. Myelin is the insulator for nerves and is present in both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system (CNS). In the CNS, it is a modified extension of the oligodendrocyte cell and is made up of multiple sheaths of protein-lipid-protein-lipid-protein. Standard T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences can be performed on any MR imaging platform and with knowledge of normal age-related myelin maturation, myelin delay can be detected. Myelination progresses in a constant predetermined pattern from bottom to top, central to peripheral and back to front. © 2013 .

AB  - Purpose: To investigate magnetization transfer (MT) effects as a new source of contrast for imaging and tracking of peripheral foot nerves. Materials and Methods: Two sets of 3D spoiled gradient-echo images acquired with and without a saturation pulse were used to generate MT ratio (MTR) maps of 260 μm in-plane resolution for eight volunteers at 3T. Scan parameters were adjusted to minimize signal loss due to T2 dephasing, and a dedicated coil was used to improve the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio of small voxels. Resulting MTR values in foot nerves were compared with those in surrounding muscle tissue. Results: Average MTR values for muscle (45.5 ± 1.4%) and nerve (21.4 ± 3.1%) were significantly different (P < 0.0001). In general, the difference in MTR values was sufficiently large to allow for intensity-based segmentation and tracking of foot nerves in individual subjects. This procedure was termed MT-based 3D visualization. Conclusion: The MTR serves as a new source of contrast for imaging of peripheral foot nerves and provides a means for high spatial resolution tracking of these structures. The proposed methodology is directly applicable on standard clinical MR scanners and could be applied to systemic pathologies, such as diabetes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A number of benign and malignant peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions produce similar imaging features on conventional anatomic MR imaging. Functional MR imaging using DTI can increment the diagnostic performance in differentiation of these lesions. Our aim was to evaluate the role of 3T anatomic MR imaging and DTI in the characterization of peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (13 men, 16 women; mean age, 41±18 years; range, 11- 83 years) with a nerve tumor or tumorlike condition (25 benign, 5 malignant) underwent 3T MR imaging by using anatomic (n=29), functional diffusion, DWI (n=21), and DTI (n=24) techniques. Images were evaluated for image quality (3-point scale), ADC of the lesion, tractography, and fractional anisotropy of nerves with interobserver reliability in ADC and FA measurements. RESULTS: Nosignificant differences were observed in age (benign, 40±18 versus malignant, 45±19 years) and sex (benign, male/female= 12:12 versus malignant, male/female=3:2) (P&gt;.05). All anatomic (29/29, 100%)MRimaging studies received 'good' quality; 20/21 (95%) DWI and 21/24 (79%) DTI studies received 'good' quality. ADC of benign lesions (1.848 ± 0.40 × 10-3 mm2/s) differed from that of malignant lesions (0.900 ± 0.25 × 10-3 mm2/s, P &lt; .001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.988 [95% CI, 0.976-0.994]). There were no FA or ADC differences between men and women (P&gt;.05). FA of involved nerves was lower than that in contralateral healthy nerves (P&lt; .001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.970 [95% CI, 0.946-0.991]). ADC on DTI and DWI was not statistically different (P &gt; .05), with excellent intermethod reliability (ICC = 0.943 [95% CI, 0.836-0.980]). Tractography differences were observed in benign and malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS: 3T MR imaging and DTI are valuable methods for anatomic and functional evaluation of peripheral nerve lesions with excellent interobserver reliability. While tractography and low FA provide insight into neural integrity, low diffusivity values indicate malignancy in neural masses.

AB  - Summary: Mutations in either nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA can result in disruption of oxidative phosphorylation and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial disease manifestations occur predominantly in the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and/or involve several organ systems. The consequences range from manifestations of a single organ or tissues, such as muscle fatigue, if confined only to muscle, seizures, intellectual disabilities, dementia, and stroke (if to the central nervous system), leading to disability or even early death. The definitive diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder can be difficult to establish. Criteria and checklists have been established and are more reflective of adult disease. However, in children, when symptoms suggest a mitochondrial disease, neuroimaging features may have more diagnostic impact and additionally these can be used to follow the course, evolution, and recovery of the disease. This review will demonstrate the common neuroimaging patterns in patients with mitochondrial disorders and point out how various newer neuroimaging modalities may be exploited to glean information as to the different aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction or resulting neurological and cognitive disruption, although reports in the literature using these methods remain sparse. © 2012 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

AB  - Adenosine signalling has long been a target for drug development, with adenosine itself or its derivatives being used clinically since the 1940s. In addition, methylxanthines such as caffeine have profound biological effects as antagonists at adenosine receptors. Moreover, drugs such as dipyridamole and methotrexate act by enhancing the activation of adenosine receptors. There is strong evidence that adenosine has a functional role in many diseases, and several pharmacological compounds specifically targeting individual adenosine receptors-either directly or indirectly-have now entered the clinic. However, only one adenosine receptor-specific agent-the adenosine A 2A receptor agonist regadenoson (Lexiscan; Astellas Pharma)-has so far gained approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Here, we focus on the biology of adenosine signalling to identify hurdles in the development of additional pharmacological compounds targeting adenosine receptors and discuss strategies to overcome these challenges.

AB  - Objective Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common median nerve entrapment neuropathy characterized by pain, paresthesias, diminished peripheral nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and maladaptive functional brain neuroplasticity. We evaluated structural reorganization in brain gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) and whether such plasticity is linked to altered median nerve function in CTS. Methods We performed NCV testing, T1-weighted structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 28 CTS and 28 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) contrasted regional GM volume for CTS versus HC. Significant clusters were correlated with clinical metrics and served as seeds to define associated WM tracts using DTI data and probabilistic tractography. Within these WM tracts, fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity were evaluated for group differences and correlations with clinical metrics. Results For CTS subjects, GM volume was significantly reduced in contralesional S1 (hand-area), pulvinar and frontal pole. GM volume in contralesional S1 correlated with median NCV. NCV was also correlated with RD and was negatively correlated with FA within U-fiber cortico-cortical association tracts identified from the contralesional S1 VBM seed. Conclusions Our study identified clear morphometric changes in the CTS brain. This central morphometric change is likely secondary to peripheral nerve pathology and altered somatosensory afference. Enhanced axonal coherence and myelination within cortico-cortical tracts connecting primary somatosensory and motor areas may accompany peripheral nerve deafferentation. As structural plasticity was correlated with NCV and not symptomatology, the former may be a better determinant of appropriate clinical intervention for CTS, including surgery. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - In the literature, the term fulminant Guillain-Barré syndrome is used to refer to patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome with rapidly progressive and severe weakness and/or comatose state mimicking brain death. We present the case of a 53-year-old man with fulminant Guillain-Barré syndrome with discrepancy in central nervous system and peripheral nervous system recovery. Our review of literature confirms that these patients often have good and relatively rapid recovery of central nervous system function, whereas peripheral nervous system function is relatively delayed and often incomplete. © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was introduced into medical practice in the early 1980s. It has become a standard medical procedure producing high-quality noninvasive images of the internal human anatomy without the use of X-rays or radioactive isotopes. It is estimated that there have been more than 600 000 000 clinical studies since the introduction of the technique and projected that more than 80 000 000 clinical studies will be performed in 2012. These studies have been performed with an excellent safety record even though intense static and very rapidly switched gradient magnetic fields are utilized. Modern developments in MRI involve the use of ever stronger magnets and gradient fields requiring continual attention to safety considerations. Despite the excellent MRI safety record, scrupulous attention is required to the exclusion of magnetic materials, either in the vicinity of scanners or within the bodies of patients, as these constitute potentially lethal risks. The increasing use of implanted active devices (e.g., cardiac defibrillators) also raises new safety concerns. Although not specifically safety issues, a number of low-level sensory effects can be produced by MRI scanning and these should be considered when very strong magnetic fields or very rapidly switched gradients are employed. The semicircular canals of the inner ear appear to be especially sensitive to head motion within strong magnetic fields. This is linked to field-induced eye motions (magnetic nystagmus) and the sensation of vertigo. At high field strengths, a novel form of motion sickness, here termed magnet sickness, may appear in susceptible individuals. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A spectrum of pathologies can affect peripheral nerves causing peripheral neuropathies. Traditionally, their evaluation relies on clinical history and clinical examination, including electrodiagnostic testing (e.g., nerve conduction studies, electromyography). However, clinical information is often insufficient as it does not provide spatial information regarding the nerves or their surrounding structures, i.e., innervated muscles [1]. Imaging provides important morphological information and thereby often helps in localization and characterization of these pathologies. Imaging using either ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also can exclude neuropathies by demonstrating normal nerves and muscles. Although morphological assessment is the mainstay of nerve imaging, recent developments such as diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor MRI may additionally allow functional assessment of nerves in the future [2]. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2013.

AB  - Injuries are separated into spinal nerve root avulsions (pre-ganglionic lesions) and more distal rupture (post-ganglionic lesions). The lesions may be associated with different nerve root levels. Spinal MRI is used to diagnose pre-ganglionic lesions, which may be present in the absence of pseudomeningoceles. The other sequences described are used to diagnose post-ganglionic lesions, regardless of the type of lesion. Knowledge that a graftable C5 nerve root is present is important in the treatment strategy. Contrast enhancement in the scalene triangle does not predict the quality of the nerve root (continuous injury with response to peroperative stimulation or division of the root needing grafting).

AB  - The first line imaging of the non-traumatic brachial plexus is by MRI. Knowledge of the anatomy and commonest variants is essential. Three Tesla imaging offers the possibility of 3D isotropic sequences with excellent spatial and contrast enhancement resolutions, which leads to time saving and quality boosting. The most commonly seen conditions are benign tumor lesions and radiation damage. Gadolinium is required to assess inflammatory or tumour plexopathy. MRI data should be correlated with FDG-PET if tumor recurrence is suspected. © 2013 Éditions françaises de radiologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To assess the agreement of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median nerve on 3.0 T MR scanners from different vendors. Materials and methods: IRB approved study including 16 healthy volunteers (9 women; mean age 30.6 ± 5.3 years). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the dominant wrist was performed on three 3.0 T MR scanners (GE, Siemens, Philips) using similar imaging protocols and vendor-proprietary hard- and software. Intra-, inter-reader and inter-vendor agreements were assessed. Results: ICCs for intra-/inter-reader agreements ranged from 0.843-0.970/0.846-0.956 for FA, and 0.840-0.940/0.726-0.929 for ADC, respectively. ANOVA analysis identified significant differences for FA/ADC measurements among vendors (p &lt; 0.001/p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Overall mean values for FA were 0.63 (SD ± 0.1) and 0.999 × 10 -3mm2/s (SD ± 0.134 × 10-3) for ADC. A significant negative measurement bias was found for FA values from the GE scanner (-0.05 and -0.07) and for ADC values from the Siemens scanner (-0.053 and -0.063 × 10-3mm2/s) as compared to the remainder vendors Conclusion: FA and ADC values of the median nerve obtained on different 3.0 T MR scanners differ significantly, but are in comparison to the standard deviation of absolute values small enough to not have an impact on larger group studies or when substantial diffusion changes can be expected. However, caution is warranted in an individual patient when interpreting diffusion values from different scanner acquisitions. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate if Diffusion Tensor Imaging technique (DTI) can improve the visualization of periprostatic nerve fibers describing the location and distribution of entire neurovascular plexus around the prostate in patients who are candidates for prostatectomy. Materials and methods: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), including a 2D T2-weighted FSE sequence in 3 planes, 3D T2-weighted and DTI using 16 gradient directions and b = 0 and 1000, was performed on 36 patients. Three out of 36 patients were excluded from the analysis due to poor image quality (blurring N = 2, artifact N = 1). The study was approved by local ethics committee and all patients gave an informed consent. Images were evaluated by two radiologists with different experience in MRI. DTI images were analyzed qualitatively using dedicated software. Also 2D and 3D T2 images were independently considered. Results: 3D-DTI allowed description of the entire plexus of the periprostatic nerve fibers in all directions, while 2D and 3D T2 morphological sequences depicted part of the fibers, in a plane by plane analysis of fiber courses. DTI demonstrated in all patients the dispersion of nerve fibers around the prostate on both sides including the significant percentage present in the anterior and anterolateral sectors. Conclusions: DTI offers optimal representation of the widely distributed periprostatic plexus. If validated, it may help guide nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - We investigated the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for detecting neuropathic changes in proximal nerve segments in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Twenty-one individuals with (n = 11) and without (n = 10) peripheral neuropathy underwent DTI of a defined sciatic nerve segment. Patients and controls were evaluated by clinical examination and nerve conduction studies at baseline and 6 months after the initial DTI scan. The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value was significantly lower in sciatic nerves from patients with peripheral neuropathy as compared with controls. Sciatic nerve FA values correlated with clinical disability scores and electrophysiological parameters of axonal damage at baseline and 6 months after MRI scan. DTI-derived FA values are a sensitive measure to discriminate healthy from functionally impaired human sciatic nerve segments. DTI of proximal nerve segments may be useful for estimating the proximal axonal degeneration burden in patients with peripheral neuropathies. Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Subsequent to peripheral nerve compression and irritation, pathophysiological processes take place within nervous and immune systems. Here, we utilized a multimodal approach to comprehend peripheral and central soft tissue changes as well as alterations occurring in systemic analytes following unilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rodents. Using magnetic resonance imaging and [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography, we demonstrated robust structural abnormalities and enhanced FDG uptake within the injured nerve and surrounding muscle, respectively. To assess whether central morphological changes were induced by nerve injury, diffusion tenor imaging was performed. A decrease in fractional anisotropy in primary motor cortex contralateral to the injury site was observed. Evaluation of a panel of circulating cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors showed decreased levels of interleukin-1β and Fractalkine in CCI animals. Area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) calculations of analyte levels, imaging, and behavioral end points ranged from 0.786 to 1, where behavioral and peripheral imaging end points (eg, FDG uptake in muscle) were observed to have the highest discriminatory capabilities (maximum area under ROC = 1) between nerve injury and sham conditions. Lastly, performance of correlation analysis involving all analyte, behavioral, and imaging data provided an understanding of the overall association amongst these end points, and importantly, a distinction in correlation patterns was observed between CCI and sham conditions. These findings demonstrate the multidimensional pathophysiology of sciatic nerve injury and how a combined analyte, behavioral, and imaging assessment can be implemented to probe this complexity.

AB  - Recent advances in genomics and statistical computation have allowed us to begin addressing the genetic basis of stroke at a molecular level. These advances are at the cusp of making important changes to clinical practice of some monogenic forms of stroke and, in the future, are likely to revolutionise the care provided to these patients. In this review we summarise the state of knowledge in ischaemic stroke genetics particularly in the context of how a practicing clinician can best use this knowledge.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder mostly affecting the aging population over sixty. Cardinal symptoms including, tremors, muscle rigidity, drooping posture, drooling, walking difficulty, and autonomic symptoms appear when a significant number of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are already destroyed. Hence we need early, sensitive, specific, and economical peripheral and/or central biomarker(s) for the differential diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of PD. These can be classified as clinical, biochemical, genetic, proteomic, and neuroimaging biomarkers. Novel discoveries of genetic as well as nongenetic biomarkers may be utilized for the personalized treatment of PD during preclinical (premotor) and clinical (motor) stages. Premotor biomarkers including hyper-echogenicity of substantia nigra, olfactory and autonomic dysfunction, depression, hyposmia, deafness, REM sleep disorder, and impulsive behavior may be noticed during preclinical stage. Neuroimaging biomarkers (PET, SPECT, MRI), and neuropsychological deficits can facilitate differential diagnosis. Single-cell profiling of dopaminergic neurons has identified pyridoxal kinase and lysosomal ATPase as biomarker genes for PD prognosis. Promising biomarkers include: fluid biomarkers, neuromelanin antibodies, pathological forms of α-Syn, DJ-1, amyloid b and tau in the CSF, patterns of gene expression, metabolomics, urate, as well as protein profiling in the blood and CSF samples. Reduced brain regional N-acetyl-aspartate is a biomarker for the in vivo assessment of neuronal loss using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and T2 relaxation time with MRI. To confirm PD diagnosis, the PET biomarkers include [18F]-DOPA for estimating dopaminergic neurotransmission, [18F]dG for mitochondrial bioenergetics, [18F]BMS for mitochondrial complex-1, [11C](R)-PK11195 for microglial activation, SPECT imaging with 123Iflupane and bCIT for dopamine transporter, and urinary salsolinol and 8-hydroxy, 2-deoxyguanosine for neuronal loss. This brief review describes the merits and limitations of recently discovered biomarkers and proposes coenzyme Q10, mitochondrial ubiquinone-NADH oxidoreductase, melatonin, α-synculein index, Charnoly body, and metallothioneins as novel biomarkers to confirm PD diagnosis for early and effective treatment of PD. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose The speed limit for three-dimensional Fourier-encoded steady state free precession (SSFP) imaging is explored on a clinical whole body system and pushed toward a pulse repetition time (TR) close to or even below the 1 ms regime; in the following referred to as ultra-fast SSFP imaging. Methods To this end, contemporary optimization strategies, such as efficient gradient switching patterns, partial echoes, ramp sampling techniques, and a target-related design of excitation pulses were applied to explore the lower boundaries in TR for SSFP-based Cartesian imaging. Results Generally, minimal TR was limited in vivo by peripheral nerve stimulation, allowing a TR ∼1 ms for isotropic resolutions down to about 2 mm. As a result, ultra-fast balanced SSFP provides artifact-free images even for targets with severe susceptibility variations, and native high-resolution structural and functional in vivo 1H imaging of the human lung is demonstrated at 1.5 T. Conclusion On clinical whole body MRI systems, the TR of SSFP-based Cartesian imaging can be pushed toward the 1 ms regime. As a result, ultra-fast SSFP protocols might represent a promising new powerful approach for SSFP-based imaging, not only for lung but also in a variety of clinical and scientific applications.

AB  - Neoplasms of neurogenic origin account for about 12% of all benign and 8% of all malignant soft tissue neoplasms. Traumatic neuroma, Morton neuroma, lipomatosis of a nerve, nerve sheath ganglion, perineurioma, benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) are included in this group of pathologies. Clinical and radiologic evaluation of patients with neurogenic tumors and pseudotumors often reveals distinctive features. In this context, advanced imaging techniques, especially ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) play an important role in the characterization of these lesions. Imaging findings such as location of a soft tissue mass in the region of a major nerve, nerve entering or exiting the mass, fusiform shape, abnormalities of the muscle supplied by the nerve, split-fat sign, target sign and fascicular appearance should always evoke a peripheric nerve sheath neoplasm. Although no single imaging finding or combination of findings allows definitive differentiation between benign from malign peripheric neurogenic tumors, both US and MR imaging may show useful features that can lead us to a correct diagnosis and improve patient treatment. Traumatic neuromas and Morton neuromas are commonly associated to an amputation stump or are located in the intermetatarsal space. Lipomatosis of a nerve usually appears as a nerve enlargement, with thickened nerve fascicles, embedded in evenly distributed fat. Nerve sheath ganglion has a cystic appearance and commonly occurs at the level of the knee. Intraneural perineuroma usually affects young people and manifests as a focal and fusiform nerve enlargement. In this article, we review clinical characteristics and radiologic appearances of these neurogenic lesions, observing pathologic correlation, when possible. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background and purpose: The autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the SACS gene. The disease, first described in Canadian families from Québec, is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract involvement and peripheral neuropathy. Methods: Analysis of SACS gene allowed the identification of 14 patients with ARSACS from 13 unrelated Italian families. Clinical phenotype, gene mutations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were analysed. Results: We found 16 novel SACS gene mutations, including a large in-frame deletion. The age at onset was in infancy, but one patient presented the first symptoms at age 32. Progression of the disease was variable, and increased muscle tone was mostly recognized in later stages. Structural MRI showed atrophy of the superior cerebellar vermis, a bulky pons exhibiting T2-hypointense stripes, identified as the corticospinal tract (CST), thinning of the corpus callosum and a rim of T2-hyperintensity around the thalami in 100% of cases. The presence of iron or other paramagnetic substances was excluded. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed grossly over-represented transverse pontine fibres (TPF), which prevented reconstruction of the CST at this level (100% of cases). In all patients, significant microstructural alterations were found in the supratentorial white matter of forceps, cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Conclusions: Our findings further enlarge the genetic spectrum of SACS mutations and widen the study of clinical phenotype. MRI characteristics indicate that pontine changes and supratentorial abnormalities are diagnostic. The over-representation of TPF on DTI suggests a developmental component in the pathogenesis of the disease. © 2012 The Author(s) European Journal of Neurology © 2012 EFNS.

AB  - Despite the common belief that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a painless disease, several studies contradict this. There are a significant number of MS patients who actually suffer from painful conditions such as central and peripheral neuropathy, migraines, trigeminal neuralgia, painful tonic spasms, complex regional pain syndrome, glosso pharyngeal neuralgia, and transverse myelitis. In addition, MS relapses are usually painful with many patients complaining of paroxysmal dystonia and neuro pathic pain during these episodes. Additionally, treatments for MS such as use of beta-inter ferons may be associated with headache and pain at the injection site. The pathophysiology of pain in MS is poorly understood, but may be related to the development of demyelinating lesions involving certain neuro anatomic pathways such as the spino thalamic tract. Management of pain in MS patients is a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Currently, various pharmacological agents such as antiepielptics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and even corticosteroids are used to suppress various painful conditions associated with MS. Non pharmacological procedures such as massage therapy have also been used in the treatment of MS patients. The authors present a review of recent findings in pathophysiology and management of pain in MS patients. © W. S. Maney & Son Ltd 2012.

AB  - Background: Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene at 17q11.2. In 95% of non-founder NF1 patients, NF1 mutations are identifiable by means of a comprehensive mutation analysis. 5-10% of these patients harbour microdeletions encompassing the NF1 gene and its flanking regions. NF1 is characterised by tumours of the peripheral nerve sheaths, the pathognomonic neurofibromas. Considerable inter- and intra-familial variation in expressivity of the disease has been observed which is influenced by genetic modifiers unrelated to the constitutional NF1 mutation. The number of plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) in NF1 patients is a highly heritable genetic trait. Recently, SNP rs2151280 located within the non-coding RNA gene ANRIL at 9p21.3, was identified as being strongly associated with PNF number in a family-based association study. The T-allele of rs2151280, which correlates with reduced ANRIL expression, appears to be associated with higher PNF number. ANRIL directly binds to the SUZ12 protein, an essential component of polycomb repressive complex 2, and is required for SUZ12 occupancy of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B tumour suppressor genes as well as for their epigenetic silencing.Methods: Here, we explored a potential association of PNF number and PNF volume with SNP rs2151280 in 29 patients with constitutional NF1 microdeletions using the exact Cochran-Armitage test for trends and the exact Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Both the PNF number and total tumour volume in these 29 NF1 patients were assessed by whole-body MRI. The NF1 microdeletions observed in these 29 patients encompassed the NF1 gene as well as its flanking regions, including the SUZ12 gene.Results: In the 29 microdeletion patients investigated, neither the PNF number nor PNF volume was found to be associated with the T-allele of rs2151280.Conclusion: Our findings imply that, at least in patients with NF1 microdeletions, PNF susceptibility is not associated with rs2151280. Although somatic inactivation of the NF1 wild-type allele is considered to be the PNF-initiating event in NF1 patients with intragenic mutations and patients with NF1 microdeletions, both patient groups may differ with regard to tumour progression because of the heterozygous constitutional deletion of SUZ12 present only in patients with NF1 microdeletions. © 2012 Mußotter et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: To implement a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol for visualization of peripheral nerves in human forearm. Materials and Methods: This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from 10 healthy participants. T1- and T2-weighted turbo spin echo with fat saturation, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and DTI sequences with 21 diffusion-encoding directions were implemented to acquire images of the forearm nerves with an 8 channel knee coil on a 3T MRI scanner. Identification of the nerves was based on T1-weighted, T 2-weighted, STIR, and DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) images. Maps of the DTI-derived indices, FA, mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity (λ//), and radial diffusivity (λ; ⊥) along the length of the nerves were generated. Results: DTI-derived maps delineated the forearm nerves more clearly than images acquired with other sequences. Only ulnar and median nerves were clearly visualized on the DTI-derived FA maps. No significant differences were observed between the left and right forearms in any of the DTI-derived measures. Significant variation in the DTI measures was observed along the length of the nerve. Significant differences in the DTI measures were also observed between the median and ulnar nerves. Conclusion: DTI is superior in visualizing the median and ulnar nerves in the human forearm. The normative data could potentially help distinguish normal from diseased nerves. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are widespread clinical modalities for cancer treatment. Among other biological influences, hypoxia is a main factor limiting the efficacy of radiother-apy, primarily because oxygen is involved in the stabilization of the DNA damage caused by ionizing radiations. Radiobiological hypoxia is found in regions of rodent and human tumors with a tissue oxygenation level below 10 mmHg at which tumor cells become increasingly resistant to radiation damage. Since hypoxic tumor cells remain clonogenic, their resis-tance to the treatment strongly influences the therapeutic outcome of radiotherapy. There is therefore an urgent need to identify adjuvant treatment modalities aimed to increase tumor pO2 at the time of radiotherapy. Since tumor hypoxia fundamentally results from an imbalance between oxygen delivery by poorly efficient blood vessels and oxygen con-sumption by tumor cells with high metabolic activities, two promising approaches are those targeting vascular reactivity and tumor cell respiration.This review summarizes the current knowledge about the development and use of tumor-selective vasodilators, inhibitors of tumor cell respiration, and drugs and treatments combining both activities in the context of tumor sensitization to X-ray radiotherapy.Tumor-selective vasodilation may also be used to improve the delivery of circulating anticancer agents to tumors. Imaging tumor perfusion and oxygenation is of importance not only for the development and validation of such com-bination treatments, but also to determine which patients could benefit from the therapy. Numerous techniques have been developed in the preclinical setting. Hence, this review also briefly describes both magnetic resonance and non-magnetic resonance in vivo meth-ods and compares them in terms of sensitivity, quantitative or semi-quantitative properties, temporal, and spatial resolutions, as well as translational aspects. © 2012 Jordan and Sonveaux.

AB  - Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders present at birth with muscle weakness, hypotonia and contractures. Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders with muscle weakness, hypotonia and contractures present at birth. A particular subset of classic CMD is characterized by a complete absence of merosin. Merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDCMD) is a rare genetic disease involving the central and peripheral nervous system in the childhood. High signal intensities are often observed throughout the centrum semiovale, periventricular, and sub-cortical white matters on T2-weighted images in MRI brain in children with MDCMD. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map may reveal increased signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient values in the periventricular and deep white matters. These white matter findings, observed in late infancy, decrease in severity with age. The pathogenesis of these changes remains uncertain at present. In this article, we outline the specific MR imaging findings seen in a patient with documented MDCMD and also suggest the causes.

AB  - The ability to investigate microstructural properties of the central nervous system with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown in many studies. More recently, DTI is being applied outside the brain showing promising results, for instance, for investigating muscle tissue. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography to study the nerves of the sacral plexus in humans in vivo and to assess the architectural configuration and microstructural properties of these peripheral nerves. For this research goal we optimized the acquisition parameters of a DTI sequence and acquired data from 10 healthy adults and one 12-year patient having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. For the healthy volunteers, we estimated the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial diffusivities (RD) of the sacral plexus nerves which may serve as a baseline for future studies. We demonstrated that tractography of the sacral plexus on a 3 Tesla MR scanner is feasible, giving 3D insight in the general anatomy and organization of the nerves L4 to S3. In addition, branches to the pudendal nerve were also found in 4 volunteers. There were no significant differences in any of the estimated diffusion measures between the right and left sided nerves or between the nerves L4 to S3 on an intra-subject basis. Furthermore, clinical feasibility of DTI and tractography in a child having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction is demonstrated. The architectural configuration of the child's sacral plexus was comparable with the healthy volunteers and no significant disrupted nerve fibers were observed. However, there are strong indications that abnormal diffusion characteristics are present at the level of the neural tube defect due to incomplete segments of the nerves that are close to the vertebrae. These findings are encouraging for using DTI as a means to investigate changes in microstructural properties of the nerves of the sacral plexus. Moreover, this new methodology may provide a new avenue to a better analysis and diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunctions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction We investigated the correlation between age and the fractional anisotropy (FA) values of peripheral nerves in healthy adults and compared the age-corrected FA values of peripheral nerves in healthy subjects and patients with polyneuropathy. Methods The institutional review board approved this study and informed consent was obtained from all participants before entry into the study. We optimized diffusion tensor imaging using a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner and an extremity coil for scanning tibial nerves. The effect of age and sex on the FA values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers was investigated and the age-corrected FA values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers and patients with polyneuropathy were compared. Results The maximum FAvalues of the tibial nerves remained constant until age 45 (approximately 0.516); they subsequently decreased by 0.004/year in healthy volunteers. After removing the effect of age with an age-adjusted equation, the median maximum FAvalues in the volunteers and patients were 0.518 (range, 0.406-0.616) and 0.442 (range, 0.376-0.530), respectively. The age-corrected FAvalues were significantly lower in the patients than the healthy volunteers (p<0.001). There was no significant gender-related difference in the maximum FA values of the tibial nerves (p=0.416). Conclusion The age-corrected FA value of the peripheral nerves helps to differentiate between age-related peripheral nerve degeneration and polyneuropathies. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Ultrasonography is widely used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a common peripheral neuropathy, but the reported diagnostic accuracy varies. This meta-analysis focused on the diagnostic test accuracy of ultrasonography for diagnosing CTS. Structured searches of PubMed for 1990-2010 were done and the data were extracted and meta-analyzed by pooling estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios. Diagnostic performance was also judged by using a summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Twenty-eight trials involving 3995 wrists were included. A greater cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel inlet (CSA-I) and a greater flattening ratio at the level of the hamate were seen in CTS wrists than in control wrists. A CSA-I ≥9 mm 2 is the best single diagnostic criterion, with a diagnostic odds ratio of 40.4 (sensitivity 87.3%, specificity 83.3%). © 2012.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to systematically assess the optimal b-value and reconstruction parameters for DTI and fiber tractography of the median nerve at 3.0 T. Methods: Local ethical board approved study with 45 healthy volunteers (15 men, 30 women; mean age, 41 ± 3.4 years) who underwent DTI of the right wrist at 3.0 T. A single-shot echo-planar-imaging sequence (TR/TE 10123/40 ms) was acquired at four different b-values (800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 s/mm 2). Two independent readers performed post processing and fiber-tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated. Fiber tracts of the median nerve were generated using four different algorithms containing different FA thresholds and different angulation tolerances. Data were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: Tracking algorithms using a minimum FA threshold of 0.2 and a maximum angulation of 10° were significantly better than other algorithms. Fiber tractography generated significantly longer fibers in DTI acquisitions with higher b-values (1200 and 1400 s/mm 2 versus 800 s/mm 2; p &lt; 0.001). The overall quality of fiber tractography was best at a b-value of 1200 s/mm 2 (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: In conclusion, our results indicate use of b-values between 1000 and 1400 s/mm 2 for DTI of the median nerve at 3.0 T. Optimal reconstruction parameters for fiber tractography should encompass a minimum FA threshold of 0.2 and a maximum angulation tolerance of 10. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives To use pre- and post-operative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to monitor median nerve integrity in patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methods Diffusivity and anisotropy images along the median nerve were compared among 12 patients, 12 age-matched and 12 young control subjects and correlated with electrophysiological neurography results. Slice-wise DTI parameter values were calculated to focus on local changes. Results Results of pre-operative patients and age-matched control subjects differed only in the distal nerve. Moreover, pre-operative patients differed significantly from young controls and post-operative patients. The main abnormalities were increased diffusivity and decreased anisotropy in the carpal tunnel and distal median nerve. Post-operative clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but not in anisotropy. Slice-wise analysis showed high pre-operative diffusivity at the distal nerve. All groups had relatively large inter-subject variation in both diffusivity and anisotropy. Conclusions DTI can provide information complementary to clinical examination, electrophysiological recordings and anatomical MRI of diseases and injuries of peripheral nerves. However, similar age-related changes in diffusivity and anisotropy may weaken DTI specificity. Slice-wise analysis is necessary for detection of local changes in nerve integrity. Key Points • Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging provides information complementary to conventional diagnostic methods. • Age caused similar changes to diffusivity and anisotropy as carpal tunnel syndrome. • Post-operative clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but not in anisotropy. • Inter-subject variation in diffusivity and anisotropy was considerable. © European Society of Radiology 2012.

AB  - Background: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a common inherited axonal or mixed axonal-demyelinating neuropathy. The disease is caused by mutations in the GJB1 gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin32, which is expressed in both Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Several reports have described CMTX patients presenting with transient and recurrent central nervous system (CNS) symptoms with transient white matter lesions in the brain. Patients: We describe a man with CMTX who presented with transient CNS symptoms and abnormal cerebral white matter lesions in MRI. He was subjected to a detailed MRI examination using two specialized techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Results: In the early stage of his CNS symptoms, MRS studies revealed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) levels in deep white matter, and DTI revealed reduced fractional anisotropy within lesions. Interestingly, these reductions began to recover from day 19 after admission, and follow-up DTI and MRS studies on day 101 revealed a reversal of the abnormalities. Conclusion: The findings of reversible reductions in fractional anisotropy and NAA levels in our patient suggest reversible axonal damage associated with deficient oligodendrocyte gap junctions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cobalt exerts well-known and documented toxic effects on the thyroid, heart and the haematopoietic system, in addition to the occupational lung disease, allergic manifestations and a probably carcinogenic action. Cobalt neurotoxicity is reported in isolated cases, and it has never been systematically treated. Bilateral optic atrophy and retinopathy, bilateral nerve deafness and sensory-motor polyneuropathy have been described long ago as a result of chronic occupational exposure to cobal powder or during long-term treatment of anaemia with cobalt chloride. Recently, some patients with high levels of cobalt released from metal prosthesis have been referred as presenting with tinnitus, deafness, vertigo, visual changes, optic atrophy, tremor and peripheral neuropathy. The aim of this work is to group these cases and to identify a possible mechanism of cobalt neurotoxicity, focusing on hypothetic individual susceptibility such as altered metal-binding proteins, altered transport processes in target cells or polymorphic variation of genetic background. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome. It has recently been shown that the underlying DNA repair defect plays a central role in the aging process. In addition to skin symptoms, various premature neurological abnormalities have been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: We present the clinical neurological phenotype in 14 XP patients (seven subtypes), in seven of these patients together with conventional and multiparametric advanced MRI data to assess the macrostructural and microstructural cerebral morphology in comparison to controls, including volumetric measurements, MR spectroscopy ( 1H MRS), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Clinical hallmarks were spinocerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract signs, and mild cognitive deficits. DTI demonstrated significantly reduced WM directionality in all regions investigated, i.e. the thalamus, the corticospinal tracts and the dorsal corpus callosum. Single patients showed a marked relative hippocampal volume reduction, but the patients were not different from controls in the volumetric measurements of hippocampal and whole brain volumes at group level. However, 1H MRS demonstrated that the hippocampal formation was metabolically altered. Conclusions: The most prominent feature was the white matter affectation, as assessed by DTI, with volume and directionality reductions of the fiber projections involving both the craniocaudal fibers and the interhemispheric connections. These findings, although heterogeneous among the study sample, could be correlated with the clinico-neurological symptoms. The imaging findings support the position that myelin structures degrade prematurely in the brain of XP patients. © 2012 Kassubek et al.

AB  - Xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) is a hereditary dermatological disease in which hypersensitivity to ultraviolet radiation and various neurological symptoms are observed. In this study, to evaluate the degeneration occurring in the brain of XPA patients, neurological examinations by an established neurologist and 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in 10 Japanese XPA patients. MRI studies included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) andmagnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in addition to conventional sequences. Neurological examinations revealed various deteriorations in the both central and peripheral nervous systemsin all subjects. MRI studies demonstrated age-dependent decline in multimodalities. Severe brain atrophy in conventional sequences, decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) value in DTI, and reduced NAA/Cre ratio in MRS were observed in the adult patients. Multimodal MRI studies unmask the neurological deterioration in XPA patients. © 2011 The Authors. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To define the optimal acquisition parameters for diffusion tensor imaging of the median nerve at the wrist and to measure the diffusion values. Patients and methods: The wrists of 14 healthy volunteers were explored using 3T MRI with a dedicated wrist coil. Each examination consisted of six sequences, varying the number of directions (15 - 20 - 30) and the b values (500 - 800 - 1000 - 2000 s/mm2). The tractography images were evaluated by two radiologists using a qualitative scale with six levels. The diffusion and anisotropy coefficients (ADC and FA) were measured and the values compared with the data in the literature. Results: Median nerve tractography was successfully achieved in all sequences. The 20 direction sequence with b = 1000 s/mm2 seemed to provide the best results for a reasonable acquisition time (5'38''). The diffusion values showed large interindividual variations. Conclusion: Optimisation of acquisitions parameters is important in peripheral nerve tractography, and may facilitate a routine use of the technique. The images obtained are easy to analyse but the diffusivity and anisotropy coefficients are too variable, however, to be used in practice. © 2012 Éditions françaises de radiologie.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying the extent of involvement of the vessel and nerve, particularly in regard to preoperative evaluation and precise localization of the tumor and its relation to the structures of the extremities, has important applications for advancing the treatment of lower extremity diseases. OBJECTIVE: To review the technical feasibility of simultaneous visualization of nerves and vessels of the lower extremities by using magnetization-prepared susceptibilityweighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MP-SWI) at 3.0T. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers and 10 patients were studied. Optimized MP-SWI, MR neurography (MRN) based on 3D diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession imaging and contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) sequences were performed for each subject. The means of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)n, SNRv, SNRm, contrastto- noise ratio (CNR)n,m and CNRv,m were calculated and the certainty of identifying nerves and vessels was determined. CNRn,m between MP-SWI and MRN, and CNRv,m between MP-SWI and CE-MRA were compared. RESULTS: MP-SWI provides slightly poorer CNRv,m than CE-MRA, whereas MP-SWI provides a better CNRn,m than MRN. In thin-slice-thickness maximum-intensity projection arbitrary planes, the sciatic nerve and its branches were clearly identified (score 1 or 2 of 2) in 17 subjects (85%); the femoral artery and the main branches were identified (score 1 or 2 of 2) in all 20 subjects (100%). The nerves are isointense to slightly hypointense to muscle, and the vessels show a more obvious hyperintense signal than muscle in MP-SWI. CONCLUSION: The proposed MP-SWI demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneously visualizing nerves and vessels of the lower extremities without using an exogenous contrast agent. It may enable straightforward localization of a disease process to a specific nerve and vessel. © 2011 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

AB  - The observation of aerobic glycolysis by tumor cells in 1924 by Otto Warburg, and subsequent innovation of imaging glucose uptake by tumors in patients with PET-CT, has incited a renewed interest in the altered metabolism of tumors. As tumors grow in situ, a fraction of it is further away from their blood supply, leading to decreased oxygen concentrations (hypoxia), which induces the hypoxia response pathways of HIF1α, mTOR, and UPR. In normal tissues, these responses mitigate hypoxic stress and induce neoangiogenesis. In tumors, these pathways are dysregulated and lead to decreased perfusion and exacerbation of hypoxia as a result of immature and chaotic blood vessels. Hypoxia selects for a glycolytic phenotype and resultant acidification of the tumor microenvironment, facilitated by upregulation of proton transporters. Acidification selects for enhanced metastatic potential and reduced drug efficacy through ion trapping. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of preclinical and clinical drugs under development for targeting aerobic glycolysis, acidosis, hypoxia and hypoxia response pathways. Hypoxia and acidosis can be manipulated, providing further therapeutic benefit for cancers that feature these common phenotypes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..

AB  - Neuroradiology is the radiological subspeciality dealing with the diagnosis, characterization and, in some cases, treatment of disease entities affecting the central or peripheral nervous system. It is a rapidly expanding field and one in which technological advances have been pivotal in driving further progression. The last few years have seen significant improvements in access to high-quality imaging; modalities and techniques that were once the remit of academic institutions with significant research interests are now accessible to the majority with reduced cost, improved availability and concomitant dissemination of expertise. The trend towards subspecialization has continued in recent years, with a specialist's career choice no longer limited to the pursuit of either a predominantly interventional or diagnostic role. The emergence of those with dedicated expertise in head and neck imaging, paediatric neuroradiology, neuro-ophthalmology, neuro-oncology and stroke is a development that is likely to continue and parallels that which is occurring in body imaging. The objectives of this chapter are to introduce the principal neuroradiological imaging modalities relevant to clinical practice, discuss what each offers and convey their respective limitations. Scenarios in which a given modality is particularly advantageous over others will be discussed as well as the circumstances that preclude the use of certain techniques. The list of modalities discussed is not intended to be exhaustive; the emphasis will be on those that are currently routinely available but novel developments and those currently limited to specialist centres functioning mainly as research tools will also be mentioned briefly. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chronic pain is a frequent component of many neurological disorders, affecting 20-40 of patients for many primary neurological diseases. These diseases result from a wide range of pathophysiologies including traumatic injury to the central nervous system, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, and exploring the aetiology of pain in these disorders is an opportunity to achieve new insight into pain processing. Whether pain originates in the central or peripheral nervous system, it frequently becomes centralized through maladaptive responses within the central nervous system that can profoundly alter brain systems and thereby behaviour (e.g. depression). Chronic pain should thus be considered a brain disease in which alterations in neural networks affect multiple aspects of brain function, structure and chemistry. The study and treatment of this disease is greatly complicated by the lack of objective measures for either the symptoms or the underlying mechanisms of chronic pain. In pain associated with neurological disease, it is sometimes difficult to obtain even a subjective evaluation of pain, as is the case for patients in a vegetative state or end-stage Alzheimer's disease. It is critical that neurologists become more involved in chronic pain treatment and research (already significant in the fields of migraine and peripheral neuropathies). To achieve this goal, greater efforts are needed to enhance training for neurologists in pain treatment and promote greater interest in the field. This review describes examples of pain in different neurological diseases including primary neurological pain conditions, discusses the therapeutic potential of brain-targeted therapies and highlights the need for objective measures of pain. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - Various case series of patients with autoimmune demyelinating disease affecting both the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS), either sequentially or simultaneously, have been reported for decades, but their frequency is considerably lower than that of the "classical" neurological autoimmune diseases affecting only either CNS or PNS, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) or Guillain-Barré-Syndrome (GBS), and attempts to define or even recognize the former as a clinical entity have remained elusive. Frequently, demyelination started with CNS involvement with subsequent PNS pathology, in some cases with a relapsing-remitting course. Three potential mechanisms for the autoimmune etiology of these conditions can be discussed: (I) They could be caused by a common autoimmunological reactivity against myelin antigens or epitopes present in both the central and peripheral nervous system; (II) They could be due to a higher general susceptibility to autoimmune disease, which in some cases may have been caused or exacerbated by immunomodulatory treatment, e.g. b-interferon; (III) Their co-occurrence might be coincidental. Another example of an autoimmune disease variably involving the central or peripheral nervous system or both is the overlapping and continuous clinical spectrum of Fisher syndrome (FS), as a variant of GBS, and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE). Recent data from larger patient cohorts with demonstration of common autoantibodies, antecedent infections, and results of detailed clinical, neuroimaging and neurophysiological investigations suggest that these three conditions are not separate disorders, but rather form a continuous spectrum with variable central and peripheral nervous system involvement. We herein review clinical and paraclinical data and therapeutic options of these disorders and discuss potential underlying common vs. divergent immunopathogenic mechanisms. © 2011.

AB  - Objective: To investigate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation during somatosensory electrical stimulation of the median nerve in acute stroke patients and to determine its correlation with ischemic damage and clinical recovery over time. Methods: Fourteen acute stroke patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during contralesional median-nerve electrical stimulation 12-48. h after stroke. Findings were then validated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and motor evoked potential by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Results: Poor clinical recovery at three months was noted in four patients with no activation in the early days after stroke, whereas good clinical recovery was observed in eight patients with a normal activation pattern in the primary sensory motor area in the acute phase. In two patients BOLD activation correlated weakly with clinical recovery. Findings from TMS and DTI partially correlated with clinical recovery and functional scores. Conclusions: Clinically relevant insights into the " functional reserve" of stroke patients gained with peripheral nerve stimulation during fMRI may carry prognostic value already in the acute period of a cerebrovascular accident. Significance: BOLD activation maps could provide insights into the functional organization of the residual systems and could contribute to medical decision making in neurological and rehabilitative treatment. © 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent imaging modality for soft tissues. Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging is an MRI technique that is sensitive to the bound protons of macromolecules and therefore can aid in the assessment of nerve damage. Methods: Measurements of the MT ratio (MTR), which provides an index of the MT effects in tissues, were performed in the wrist and foot of 5 volunteers. Results: The MTR of foot (interdigital) nerves (22.2 ± 2.1%) was smaller than that of the median nerve (41.1 ± 1.4%). No difference was observed between MTR in muscles adjacent to foot nerves (46.0 ± 1.5%) and muscles adjacent to the median nerve (44.2 ± 1.9%). Conclusions: In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the MTR of foot nerves. The difference of MTR between median and foot nerves indicates a difference in structure/composition. The MTR of peripheral nerves may serve as a biomarker of nerve damage, collagen integrity, and demyelination. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To observe the longitudinal changes of nerve repair in rats after tissue-engineered construct implantation at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to determine whether the enhanced nerve regeneration with use of tissue-engineered constructs could be monitored with gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging or nerve T2 relaxation time measurement. Materials and Methods: All experimental protocols were approved by the institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Tissue-engineered constructs were prepared by seeding mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chitosan nerve tubes. Thirty-six rats with sciatic nerve transection injury underwent nerve tube implantation with (n = 18) or without (n = 18) MSC seeding. Sequential T2 measurement, gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging, and sciatic function index measurement were performed over an 8-week follow-up period, with histologic assessments performed at regular intervals. T2 relaxation times and signal intensity at gadofluorine M-enhanced T1-weighted imaging were measured and were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by the Student-Neuman-Keuls post-hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons. Results: Nerve T2 relaxation times and gadofluorine M enhancement, as well as functional changes, showed a similar time course. Nerves implanted with MSC-seeded tubes achieved slightly better functional recovery and enhanced nerve regeneration while showing a slower return to baseline T2 relaxation time and a more rapid decline in gadofluorine M enhancement compared with nerves implanted with chitosan tubes alone. T2 values of the distal portion of transected nerves showed a more rapid return to baseline level than did gadofluorine M enhancement. Conclusion: Peripheral nerve repair with use of tissue-engineered constructs can be monitored by using gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging and T2 relaxation time measurements. T2 relaxation time seems more sensitive than gadofluorine M-enhanced MR imaging for detecting nerve regeneration. © RSNA, 2011.

AB  - MRI may provide treatment outcome measures in neuromuscular conditions. The authors assessed MRI magnetisation transfer ratios (MTRs) in lower-limb musculature as markers of pathology in peripheral neuropathies and compared the findings with associated clinical data. Ten patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and nine patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) were compared with 10 healthy subjects. The MTR in the calf muscles was significantly lower than controls in the two patient groups (both p<0.001). The median MTRs (IQR) were 50.5(1.6) percentage units (p.u.) (control), 41.5 (10.6) p.u. (CMT1A) and 39.3(8.7) p.u. (CIDP). Moreover, anterior lower leg MTR correlated strongly with strength of ankle dorsiflexion, measured with the Medical Research Council scale, in CIDP (ρ=0.88, p<0.001) and also in CMT1A (r=0.50, p<0.05), where MTR also showed an association with disease duration (ρ=-0.86, p<0.001). Short tau inversion recovery MRI of the same muscles showed abnormalities associated with regions of reduced MTR (p<0.001), and MTR was also reduced in other muscles otherwise deemed normal appearing (p<0.001), indicating that MTR may be more sensitive to muscle damaged by denervation than conventional MRI. The significant reductions in muscle MTR in peripheral neuropathies and the associated correlations with clinical measures indicate that MTR has potential as an imaging outcome measure in future therapeutic trials.

AB  - Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy. Compression of the peripheral median nerve within the carpal tunnel at the wrist leads to a range of structural and functional changes, which ultimately leads to neuroplastic change in the central nervous system (CNS). CTS is characterized by dysesthesias, or unpleasant atypical sensations, and persistent pain. This symptomatology and peripheral nerve block change the quantity and quality of the somatosensory afference reaching the cortex, likely engendering central neuroplasticity. In fact, CTS provides an excellent opportunity to investigate cortical reorganization induced by clinically relevant aberrant afference in humans. Recent neuroimaging studies have applied techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to evaluate neuroplasticity in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and elsewhere in the brain. This review will outline both peripheral pathophysiology characterizing chronic nerve compression, and the downstream central neuroplasticity that occurs with CTS and related nerve compression disorders. We will also detail therapeutic interventions that have demonstrated benefit for CTS. While surgery remains the definitive treatment for severe CTS, mild and moderate CTS may be treated with more conservative therapies, such as neuromodulation-based techniques, including TENS and electro-acupuncture. This review will also detail future directions for exploring neuroplasticity in CTS, as well as how better characterization of neuroplastic change in the CNS can inform the development of future therapeutic interventions. © Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Vigabatrin is an effective antiepileptic drug (AED) for the treatment of refractory complex partial seizures (rCPS) and infantile spasms (IS). In clinical trials, vigabatrin was generally well-tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to that of other AEDs. The most common treatment-related adverse events were central nervous system effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and fatigue, with adjunctive vigabatrin in adults with rCPS, and sedation, somnolence, and irritability with vigabatrin monotherapy in infants with IS. Vigabatrin had little effect on cognitive function, mood, or behavior in a battery of neuropsychologic tests for rCPS. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of depression and psychosis, but not other psychiatric adverse events, was greater with vigabatrin than placebo. Intramyelinic edema (IME) was initially identified in rats and dogs and led to a temporary suspension of clinical trials in the United States. IME was subsequently correlated with delays in evoked potential (EP) and increased T2-weighted signals on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical trials of vigabatrin were allowed to resume after IME was not detected by neuropathologic assessments of autopsy and neurosurgical specimens or by serial EP or MRI assessments in older children and adults receiving vigabatrin. Subsequently, MRI abnormalities characterized by increased T2 intensity and restricted diffusion were identified in infants treated with vigabatrin for IS. These abnormalities generally resolved with discontinuation of vigabatrin and, in some cases, during continued therapy. The benefit of improved seizure control must be balanced against the potential risks associated with vigabatrin, including abnormal MRI changes and other vigabatrin-related safety issues. © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

AB  - The existence of long-lasting cellular reservoirs of HIV-1 is one of the major hurdles in developing effective anti-retroviral therapies. These latently infected cells and tissues efficiently evade immune responses and remain dormant until activated, upon which they can generate a productive HIV-1 infection. This classic scenario of viral latency becomes even more difficult to study and model due to the extreme complexity of translating in vivo virus-cell interactions into a controlled in vitro system. The recent developments and constant improvements upon hematopoietic engraftment of human cells and tissues onto recipient immunocompromised murine scaffolds have made it possible to model complex human innate and adaptive immune responses in a small animal model. Specifically, HIV-1 infection has been successfully modeled in these humanized mice to mimic transmission, pathogenesis, host immune responses, and treatment. Here, we review the complexities surrounding modeling HIV-1 latency in vitro and in vivo and highlight the most recent humanized mouse models that support retroviral infection. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the evaluation of peripheral nerves in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Methods: Using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, we obtained DTI scans of the tibial nerves of 10 CIDP patients and 10 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. We prepared fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, measured the FA values of tibial nerves, and compared these values in the two study groups. In nine patients, we also performed tibial nerve conduction studies and analyzed the correlation between the FA values and parameters of the nerve conduction study. Results: The tibial nerve FA values in CIDP patients (median 0.401, range 0.312-0.510) were significantly lower than those in healthy volunteers (median 0.530, range 0.469-0.647) (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.01). They were significantly correlated with the amplitude of action potential (Spearman correlation coefficient, p=0.04, r=0.86) but not with nerve conduction velocity (p=0.79, r=0.11). Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that the noninvasive DTI assessment of peripheral nerves may provide useful information in patients with CIDP. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Purpose: To describe a new semiautomated method for segmenting and measuring the volume of the muscle, bone, and adipose (subcutaneous and intermuscular) tissue in calf muscle compartments using magnetic resonance (MR) images and determine the intrarater and interrater reproducibility of the measures. Materials and Methods: Proton-density weighted MR images were acquired from the right calf of 21 subjects. Three raters segmented and measured the volumes of bones, adipose tissue, and five individual muscle compartments. Two raters repeated the segmentations. The intra- and interrater reproducibility of the measures (intraclass correlation coefficients; ICC) were determined using generalizability theory. Results: All ICC values were greater than 0.96. The average standard error of the mean (SEM) of all measures was 1.21 cm3 and none were greater than 2.3 cm3. Essentially all variation (≥97% for all measures) was due to subject differences, indicating low error in the measurements. Conclusion: The volumetric measurements for the bones, adipose tissue, and muscle in each of the compartments using MRI were highly reproducible. MRI can provide quantitative, reproducible volumetric measures of bone, adipose tissue, and individual muscle compartments in the calf. We believe these methods can be used to quantify specific muscle or adipose volumetric measures for other clinical or research purposes. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Opinion statement: The systemic amyloidoses are a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by extracellular deposition of misfolded fibrillar protein that results in organ dysfunction. Involvement of the heart (cardiac amyloidosis) is manifest by increased cardiac wall thickness and impairment of myocardial diastolic and systolic properties, changes that result in heart failure, dysrhythmia, and death. Amyloidosis is classified by precursor protein, with light-chain (AL) and transthyretin (TTR) disease being most common in the United States. TTR amyloid can result from misfolding of variant TTR, a genetically inherited disease, or wild-type TTR, an acquired form of disease (termed senile systemic amyloidosis). In recent years, advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac amyloidosis include identification and validation of disease biomarkers, new imaging techniques, and consensus treatment guidelines. Elevations of B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponins can identify cardiac amyloidosis with a high degree of precision and confer important prognostic information. Non-invasive cardiac imaging techniques, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography with strain quantification, afford the ability to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis most often without the need for a confirmatory heart biopsy. Treatment of heart failure resulting from cardiac amyloidosis differs in many respects from most other etiologies of cardiomyopathy. The mainstay of treatment involves volume control with diuretics, low dose β-adrenergic antagonists or amiodarone for dysrhythmia, and warfarin to prevent thromboembolism. Although widely held to have a dismal prognosis, modern treatments such as high-dose melphalan with stem cell transplantation (HDM/SCT) for AL disease achieve a complete hematologic response in nearly half of eligible patients and yield long-term survival. For patients with advanced AL cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac transplantation followed by HDM/SCT is also an option that has proven highly effective. For familial amyloid derived from variant TTR, liver transplantation is the one validated treatment; however, small molecule therapeutic agents now in clinical trials appear capable of slowing or halting TTR amyloid deposition. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - We describe a male infant with a novel SOX10 mutation and a severe course of PCWH-a special phenotype of Shah-Waardenburg syndrome involving peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, central dysmyelinating leukodystrophy, Waardenburg syndrome, and Hirschsprung's disease. The patient had severe hypoplastic hypoganglionosis of the small and total colonic intestine together with peripheral and central dysmyelination. The patient was completely dependent on parenteral nutrition. We identified a novel frameshift mutation, p.Asp293GlyfsX10, in the SOX10 gene of this patient. The mutation would encode a protein that lacked the transactivation domain and resulted in the largest duplication described to date. At the age of 20 months, the boy presented with a severe complication with a translocation of Escherichia coli and developed sepsis leading to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with persistent vegetative state (PVS). The boy died at the age of 24 months. Conclusion: Septic encephalopathy with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy can be a serious complication in severe sepsis. It is unknown to what extent the mutant SOX10 protein influenced the degree of brain injury-for example central nervous system susceptibility to hypoxia-during sepsis, which may explain the severe encephalopathy with clinical signs of PVS the boy developed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The panel believes that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for managing colorectal cancer. The panel endorses the concept that treating patients in a clinical trial has priority over standard or accepted therapy. The recommended surgical procedure for resectable colon cancer is an en bloc resection and adequate lymphadenectomy. Adequate pathologic assessment of the resected lymph nodes is important, with a goal of evaluating at least 12 nodes. Adjuvant therapy with FOLFOX (category 1, preferred), FLOX (category 1), CapeOx (category 1), 5-FU/LV (category 2A), or capecitabine (category 2A) is recommended by the panel for patients with stage III disease. Adjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk stage II disease is also an option; the panel recommends 5-FU/LV with or without oxaliplatin (FOLFOX or FLOX) or capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin (category 2A for all treatment options). Patients with metastatic disease in the liver or lung should be considered for surgical resection if they are candidates for surgery and if all original sites of disease are amenable to resection (R0) and/or ablation. Preoperative chemotherapy can be considered as initial therapy in patients with synchronous or metachronous resectable metastatic disease. When a response to chemotherapy would likely convert a patient from an unresectable to a resectable state (i.e., conversion therapy), this therapy should be initiated. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered after resection of liver or lung metastases. The recommended posttreatment surveillance program includes serial CEA determinations and periodic chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT scans, colonoscopic evaluations, and a survivorship plan to manage long-term side effects of treatment, facilitate disease prevention, and promote a healthy lifestyle. Recommendations for patients with disseminated metastatic disease represent a continuum of care in which lines of treatment are blurred rather than discrete. Principles to consider at initiation of therapy include preplanned strategies for altering therapy for patients in both the presence and absence of disease progression, including plans for adjusting therapy for patients who experience certain toxicities. Recommended initial therapy options for advanced or metastatic disease depend on whether the patient is appropriate for intensive therapy. The more-intensive initial therapy options include FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, CapeOx, and FOLFOXIRI (category 2B). Addition of a biologic agent (e.g., bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab) is either recommended or listed as an option in combination with some of these regimens, depending on available data. Chemotherapy options for patients with progressive disease depend on the choice of initial therapy. © JNCCN-Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

AB  - Measurements of the cross sectional area of the sciatic nerve are described in a group of 10 patients with genetically confirmed Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), nine patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and 10 healthy controls using MRI. One mid-thigh of each individual was imaged using a short tau inversion recovery sequence and the nerve appearance evaluated radiologically with respect to the signal intensity and visibility of the internal neural structure. The cross sectional area of the sciatic nerve of each individual was measured by defining irregular enclosing regions of interest on the MRI images. The sciatic nerve area was enlarged in both CMT1A (p&lt;0.001) and CIDP (p=0.008) compared with controls and in CMT1A compared with CIDP (p&lt;0.001). Median (interquartile range) areas were 67.6 (16.2) mm 2 for the CIDP group, 135.9 (46.5) mm 2for the CMT1A group and 43.3 (19.9) mm 2 for the control group. The critical upper value for discriminating pathologically enlarged nerves from normal controls with p&lt;0.05 was 64.4 mm 2. Quantification of sciatic nerve hypertrophy on MRI may be of assistance in cases where the diagnosis is still in doubt, providing an objective pathological marker complimenting other clinical investigations.

AB  - The majority of nerve fibers in the spinal cord run longitudinally, playing an important role in connecting the brain to the peripheral nerves. There is a growing interest in applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to the evaluation of spinal cord microarchitecture. The current study sought to compare the organization of longitudinal nerve fibers between healthy and myelopathic spinal cords using entropy-based analysis of principal eigenvector mapping. A total of 22 subjects were recruited, including 14 healthy subjects, seven cervical myelopathy (CM) patients with single-level compression, and one patient suffering from multi-level compression. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (MR) images of the cervical spinal cord were obtained using a pulsed gradient, spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence with a 3T MR system. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually to cover the spinal cord, and Shannon entropy was calculated in principal eigenvector maps. The results revealed no significant differences in orientation entropy values along the whole length of cervical spinal cord in healthy subjects (C2-3: 0.73 ± 0.05; C3-4: 0.71 ± 0.07; C4-5: 0.72 ± 0.048; C5-6: 0.71 ± 0.07; C6-7: 0.72 ± 0.07). In contrast, orientation entropy values in myelopathic cord were significantly higher at the compression site (0.91 ± 0.03), and the adjacent levels (above: 0.85 ± 0.03; below: 0.83 ± 0.05). This study provides a novel approach to analyze the orientation information in diffusion MR images of healthy and diseased spinal cord. These results indicate that orientation entropy can be applied to determine the contribution of each compression level to the overall disorganization of principal nerve tracts of myelopathic spinal cord in cases with multi-level compression. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Among the neoplastic conditions that affect patients with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) are malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which typically arise from peripheral nerves of the limbs, trunk, and lumbar and brachial plexuses. Ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for MPNST development, especially in susceptible patients such as those with NF1. Patients with NF1 are also at risk for intracranial aneurysms, which are increasingly being successfully managed with endovascular therapies. The authors describe the case of a 9-year-old, previously healthy girl who presented in extremis with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage resulting from a ruptured right middle cerebral artery (MCA) trifurcation aneurysm. Following urgent decompressive craniectomy, the patient underwent endovascular coil embolization of the MCA aneurysm without complication. Given her mother's history of NF1, the child underwent genetic testing, which disclosed signs positive for NF1. The patient recovered well, but follow-up MR imaging and MR angiography performed at 14 months demonstrated a large frontotemporal mass encasing the right MCA trifurcation. The patient underwent frontotemporal craniotomy and subtotal resection of the mass, which was histologically found to be an intracranial MPNST. The patient received chemotherapy and focal radiation therapy and remains alive at 6 months postresection. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the only known case of intracranial neoplasm arising in the region of an intracranial aneurysm repaired by endovascular coil embolization. While patients with NF1 represent a population with genetic susceptibility to radiation-induced tumors, the pathogenesis of intracerebral MPNSTs remains poorly understood.

AB  - Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, central nervous system disease that frequently causes pain. Areas covered: This article reviews the current literature and describes the therapeutic options for treating MS-related pain. The reader will be provided with current, evidence-based knowledge about the treatment of MS-related pain, and the review will take a practical approach to the various drugs for treating pain, including starting dose, titration and side effects. Expert opinion: Only cannabinoids have been assessed in randomized, controlled trials. Because of the concern regarding the risk of abuse and psychiatric adverse events, published guidelines as well as expert recommendations suggest using them as second-line therapy only. Hence, current treatment should be based on the general principles for treating peripheral neuropathic pain, taking into account drug-induced adverse effects. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Various neurological problems of the brain are known to occur in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings in patients with ESRD. Using DTI, we attempted to investigate DTI findings in patients with ESRD who showed no specific lesions on conventional brain MRI. We recruited 10 consecutive patients with ESRD for whom at least 3 years had passed since the start of peritoneal dialysis and who showed no neurological abnormality on neurologic examination. We excluded 6 patients who showed cerebral infarct (4 patients) and diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy (2 patients); finally, 4 patients (39.75 ± 9.84 years) were included in this study. We evaluated hand motor function and cognition. DTI data were acquired using a 1.5-T Philips Gyroscan Intera system and diffusion tensor tractographies (DTTs) for five neural tracts (corticospinal tract, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus) were evaluated. With the exception of 1 patient who revealed a mild abnormality at a higher cognitive function, no abnormalities in motor and cognitive function were observed. Among the 10 DTTs, except for those of the corticospinal tract, all 4 patients had more than one lesion. Patients with ESRD showed abnormalities on DTTs that were associated with cognition; however, they did not show significant cognitive abnormalities. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Purpose: To assess optic nerve (ON) regeneration after injury by applying manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) in a study of comparative physiology between nonregenerating rat and mouse species and regenerating frog and fish species. Materials and Methods: The normal visual projections of rats, mice, frogs, and fish was visualized by intravitreal MnCl 2 injection followed by MRI. Rats and mice with ON crush (ONC) were divided into nonregenerating (ONC only), and regenerating animals with peripheral nerve graft (ONC+PNG; rats) or lens injury (ONC+LI; mice) and monitored by MEMRI at 1 and 20 days post-lesion (dpl). Frog and fish with ON transection (ONT) were monitored by MEMRI up to 6 months postlesion (mpl). Results: Signal intensity profiles of the Mn 2+-enhanced ON were consistent with ON regeneration in the ONC+PNG and ONC+LI rat and mice groups, respectively, compared with the nonregenerating ONC groups. Furthermore, signal intensity profiles of the Mn 2+- enhanced ON obtained between 1 mpl and 6 mpl in the fish and frog groups, respectively, were consistent with spontaneous, complete ON regeneration. Conclusion: Taken together, these results demonstrate that MEMRI is a viable method for serial, in vivo monitoring of normal, induced, and spontaneously regenerating optic nerve axons in different species. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is considered a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the SACS gene, located on chromosome 13q12.12. It is a syndrome that comprises skeletal, retinal and neurological manifestations, among which feature spasticity, cerebellar ataxia and peripheral neuropathy.Five patients with a molecular diagnosis of ARSACS underwent clinical, radiological, and ophthalmologic examinations. Every one of the identified causal mutations was novel. Spastic ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, pes cavus, and hammertoes were found in every case. T2 and T2-fluid attenuation inversion recovery-weighted MRI sequences demonstrated cerebellar atrophy and a hypointense linear striation at the pons. Tensor diffusion sequences revealed that the hypointense striation corresponded with hyperplasia of the pontocerebellar fibres, which gave place to abnormally thick middle cerebellar peduncles. Stereophotographs of the optic discs showed an increased number of retinal fibres, and ocular coherence tomography, increased thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer. The authors suggest that the hyperplasic pontocerebellar fibres compress the pyramidal tracts at the pons since a very early stage of central nervous system development, causing spasticity, and may also cause cerebellar atrophy by means of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. The abnormal amount of retinal fibres traversing the optic discs could have caused the detected mild peripheral visual field defects.Taken together, these facts point to a developmental cause in ARSACS, as it does not exhibit the tissue atrophy characteristic of degenerative diseases. Clinical deterioration in ARSACS seems to be mediated by phenomena (compression of the pyramidal tracts and cerebellar glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity) derived from the developmental anomalies referred to, while the neuromuscular symptoms are caused by a peripheral neuropathy with pathologic features suggestive of a similar origin. These observations should be taken into account when research about the origin of ARSACS is undertaken. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diabetic neuropathy is a chronic and often disabling condition that affects a significant number of individuals with diabetes. Long considered a disease of the peripheral nervous system, there is now increasing evidence of central nervous system involvement. Recent advances in neuroimaging methods detailed in this review have led to a better understanding and refinement of how diabetic neuropathy affects the central nervous system. Recognition that diabetic neuropathy is, in part, a disease that affects the whole nervous system is resulting in a critical rethinking of this disorder, opening a new direction for further research. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Chimpanzee attacks can be vicious, mutilating, and disabling if not fatal. Stereotypically, the hands and face are targeted, and in male victims, genitalia are mutilated. The authors present a case highlighting the difficulties with early neurological assessment following such an attack. This 55-year-old woman was attacked by a 14-year-old chimpanzee. She suffered mutilation of both hands, severe midface bony, soft-tissue, and eye injuries, and scalp degloving. An emergency tracheotomy was performed at the scene, with an unclear duration of hypoxia. The patient was unresponsive without spontaneous movements, papillary or corneal reflexes, cough, or gag. Attempts to lighten sedation were not tolerated. Brain CTs were normal. Intracranial pressure monitoring was deemed infeasible. Brain MR imaging suggested diffuse axonal injury consistent with severe shaking trauma. Diffusion tensor imaging indicated intact corticospinal tracts, confirmed by somatosensory evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested left optic nerve transaction, and right retinal detachment was diagnosed. Electroencephalography showed severe diffuse encephalopathy. Auditory evoked potentials showed absent auditory pathway responses except for a right delayed wave V. Visual evoked potentials indicated absent visual function. At 1 month after the attack, sedation and analgesia weaning revealed lower-extremity movement to command, but no upper-limb response. Cervical spine and brachial plexus MR imaging showed brachial plexus edema. Two months after the attack, the patient regained strength in all her extremities and verbally communicated using a Passy-Muir tracheostomy valve. Chimpanzee attacks on humans can cause extensive, life-threatening injuries. The neurological assessment of such patients is challenging, complicated by limb and craniofacial disfigurement and the need for heavy sedation. Initial assessment of nervous system integrity may rely on costly imaging and electrophysiological studies.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) neurography in children, and the potential roles of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fiber-tracking (FT) techniques. Methods: Five pediatric patients (age range: 6-12 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for various clinical indications: neurogenic bladder (case 1); persistent hand pain following minor trauma (case 2); progressive atrophy of the lower left extremity muscles (case 3); bilateral hip pain (case 4); and palpable left supraclavicular mass (case 5). All studies were performed using a 1.5-T Avanto MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The protocol included 3D T2-weighted STIR and SPACE imaging, T1-weighted fat-saturation post-gadolinium imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tractography. ADC (N×10-3 mm2/s) and FA values were calculated from regions of interest (ROIs) centered on the nerves. Nerve-fiber tracks were calculated using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (NeuroD software). Results: MR neurography allowed satisfactory visualization of all neural structures, and FA and ADC measurements were feasible. The final diagnoses were Tarlov cysts, median-nerve compression, sciatic perineurioma, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and plexiform neurofibroma in a patient with NF-1. Discussion: FA and ADC measurements are of little value because of the lack of normal reference values. Nerve-fiber tractography (FT) may be of value in the characterization of tumor pathology, and is also helpful in the planning of surgical treatments. Conclusion: MR neurography is feasible in pediatric patients. However, a considerable amount of work has yet to be done to establish its role in the clinical management of the wide range of peripheral nerve diseases. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Plexiform Neurofibroma (PN) is a major complication of NeuroFibromatosis-1 (NF1), a common genetic disease that involving the nervous system. PNs are peripheral nerve sheath tumors extending along the length of the nerve in various parts of the body. Treatment decision is based on tumor volume assessment using MRI, which is currently time consuming and error prone, with limited semi-automatic segmentation support. We present in this paper a new method for the segmentation and tumor mass quantification of PN from STIR MRI scans. The method starts with a user-based delineation of the tumor area in a single slice and automatically detects the PN lesions in the entire image based on the tumor connectivity. Experimental results on seven datasets yield a mean volume overlap difference of 25% as compared to manual segmentation by expert radiologist with a mean computation and interaction time of 12 minutes vs. over an hour for manual annotation. Since the user interaction in the segmentation process is minimal, our method has the potential to successfully become part of the clinical workflow. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

AB  - As with many disorders affecting the central nervous system, treatment of chronic pain is fraught with difficulties related to specific diagnosis and measures of treatment efficacy. Given the recent advances that brain-imaging techniques have contributed to our understanding of how chronic pain affects multiple aspects of brain function (including sensory, emotional, cognitive, and modulatory), opportunities to use these approaches in the clinic are clearly a focus of research laboratories around the world. The routine application of brain imaging as a clinical marker of disease state or therapeutic (drug) efficacy would significantly enhance the clinical process by providing objective measures for clinicians and patients. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most common acquired myopathy in people older than 50 years. IBM typically presents with distal upper extremity weakness accompanied by proximal lower extremity muscle weakness. Associated clinical findings include asymmetric weakness, foot drop, and dysphagia. The pathogenesis of IBM is not clear. In this article the authors briefly discuss postulated pathogenic mechanisms. Although no proven pharmacotherapy exists, some promising candidates are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. We assessed the changes in the DTI parameters and histological analyses after nerve injury to examine degeneration and regeneration in the rat sciatic nerves. Materials and Methods: For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 16 rats were randomly divided into two groups: group P (permanently crushed; n = 7) and group T (temporally crushed; n = 9). Serial MRI of the right leg was performed before the operation, and then performed at the timepoints of 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the crush injury. The changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (λ ∥), and radial diffusivity (λ⊥) were quantified. For histological analyses, the number of axons and the myelinated axon areas were quantified. Results: Decreased FA and increased λ⊥ were observed in the degenerative phase, and increased FA and decreased λ⊥ were observed in the regenerative phase. The changes in FA and λ⊥ were strongly correlated with histological changes, including axonal and myelin regeneration. Conclusion: DTI parameters, especially λ⊥, can be good indicators for peripheral nerve regeneration and can be applied as noninvasive diagnostic tools for a variety of neurological diseases. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - In the 10 years since our previous International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology report on the nomenclature and classification of adenosine receptors, no developments have led to major changes in the recommendations. However, there have been so many other developments that an update is needed. The fact that the structure of one of the adenosine receptors has recently been solved has already led to new ways of in silico screening of ligands. The evidence that adenosine receptors can form homo- and heteromultimers has accumulated, but the functional significance of such complexes remains unclear. The availability of mice with genetic modification of all the adenosine receptors has led to a clarification of the functional roles of adenosine, and to excellent means to study the specificity of drugs. There are also interesting associations between disease and structural variants in one or more of the adenosine receptors. Several new selective agonists and antagonists have become available. They provide improved possibilities for receptor classification. There are also developments hinting at the usefulness of allosteric modulators. Many drugs targeting adenosine receptors are in clinical trials, but the established therapeutic use is still very limited.

AB  - Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking is used for 3-dimensional visualization of the nervous system. Peripheral nerves and all cranial nerves, except for the olfactory tract, have previously been visualized. The olfactory tracts are difficult to depict with diffusion-weighted imaging due to the high sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts at the base of the skull. Here we report an optimized single-shot diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence that can visualize the olfactory tracts with fiber tracking. Five healthy individuals were examined, and the olfactory tracts could be fiber tracked with the diffusion-weighted sequence. For comparison and as a negative control, an anosmic patient was examined. No olfactory tracts were visualized on T2-weighted nor diffusion-weighted fiber tracking images. Measuring diffusion in the olfactory tracts promise to facilitate the identification of different hyposmic and anosmic conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to visualize and evaluate normal fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the sciatic nerve in four volunteers at 3T.Methods: Initially, T1‐ weighted axial anatomic reference images were performed for anatomic reference (TR/TE, 641/10; flip angle 90 degrees; field of view, 128 mm; number of signal averages(NSA) of 2. Next, single‐shot spin‐echo echo‐ planar DTI sequences were performed with parameters: TR/TE, 5300/69; flip angle 90 degrees; field of view 16 cm; matrix size 128 × 128; 2 NSA; slice thickness 4 mm; number of slices, 40. Diffusion weighting with a b value of 1,000 s/mm2 was applied in 32 different directions. Total required imaging time was approximately 15 minutes. Image data was transferred to a workstation and fiber tracking was performed with Philips advanced tractography software available on the scanner and workstation. Color coded maps demonstrating the sciatic nerve were used to place circular regions‐of interest were then drawn over the nerve location demonstrated on the color coded maps to determine FA and ADCResults: In four volunteers (all males, average age = 40) the sciatic nerve was well visualized and had an average +/− SD FA of 0.52+/−0.20and ADC of ACD of 0.78+/−0.38 Conclusions: Normal FA and ADC values of the sciatic nerve could be measured using DTI and fiber tracking. Further studies are needed but these results suggest that FA and ADC can potentially be used to evaluate peripheral neuropathy and be used in patient follow‐up. © 2011, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

AB  - Idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system usually present with a typical morphologic pattern in adults, with multiple sclerosis as the predominant disorder. However, the variety of disorders in children has an odd range of features that have piqued the interest of researchers. Information concerning this group of diseases, both in vivo and in different age groups, has particularly progressed with the advent of magnetic resonance imaging in the last few decades. In this article, we provide an overview of the applicability of imaging for idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system in children. In addition to pediatric multiple sclerosis, this review addresses other related disorders, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, pediatric neuromyelitis optica, recurrent optic neuritis, and relapsing transverse myelitis. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Acquired white matter abnormalities in children may be due to a broad spectrum of disorders, with the most significant related to metabolic and toxic etiologies. Recognition of the imaging appearance of neonatal hypoglycemia, nonketotic hyperglycemia, hyperammonemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is essential because prompt correction of the underlyingmetabolic abnormality may limit and, in some cases, reverse the cerebral damage. Toxic leukoencephalopathies encompass disorders caused by iatrogenic administration of pharmacologic agents and radiation therapy, poisoning by household substances, and recreational drug use. Although medication-induced leukoencephalopathies often show a propensity for reversibility of clinical and radiologic findings upon discontinuation of the offending substance, recreational drugsmay causewhitematter toxicity that often portends a poorer prognosis. Our discussion focuses on the clinical aspects, pathophysiological mechanisms, and imaging features of commonly encountered acquired metabolic and toxic leukoencephalopathies in the pediatric population. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - More than 200 studies and reports have been published regarding the use of dexmedetomidine in infants and children. We reviewed the English literature to summarize the current state of knowledge of this drug in children for the practicing anesthesiologist. Dexmedetomidine is an effective sedative for infants and children that only minimally depresses the respiratory system while maintaining a patent airway. However, dexmedetomidine does depress the cardiovascular system. Specifically, bradycardia, hypotension, and hypertension occur to varying degrees depending on the age of the child. Hypertension is more prevalent when larger doses of dexmedetomidine are given to infants. Consistent with its 2-hour elimination half-life, recovery after dexmedetomidine may be protracted in comparison with other sedatives. Dexmedetomidine provides and augments analgesia and diminishes shivering as well as agitation postoperatively. The safety record of dexmedetomidine suggests that it can be used effectively and safely in children, with appropriate monitoring and interventions to manage cardiovascular sequelae.

AB  - Damage to the peripheral nervous system is surprisingly common and occurs primarily from trauma or a complication of surgery. Although recovery of nerve function occurs in many mild injuries, outcomes are often unsatisfactory following severe trauma. Nerve repair and regeneration presents unique clinical challenges and opportunities, and substantial contributions can be made through the informed application of biomedical engineering strategies. This article reviews the clinical presentations and classification of nerve injuries, in addition to the state of the art for surgical decision-making and repair strategies. This discussion presents specific challenges that must be addressed to realistically improve the treatment of nerve injuries and promote widespread recovery. In particular, nerve defects a few centimeters in length use a sensory nerve autograft as the standard technique; however, this approach is limited by the availability of donor nerve and comorbidity associated with additional surgery. Moreover, we currently have an inadequate ability to noninvasively assess the degree of nerve injury and to track axonal regeneration. As a result, wait-and-see surgical decisions can lead to undesirable and less successful "delayed" repair procedures. In this fight for time, degeneration of the distal nerve support structure and target progresses, ultimately blunting complete functional recovery. Thus, the most pressing challenges in peripheral nerve repair include the development of tissue-engineered nerve grafts that match or exceed the performance of autografts, the ability to noninvasively assess nerve damage and track axonal regeneration, and approaches to maintain the efficacy of the distal pathway and targets during the regenerative process. Biomedical engineering strategies can address these issues to substantially contribute at both the basic and applied levels, improving surgical management and functional recovery following severe peripheral nerve injury. © 2011 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by infantile onset and rapid progression of psychomotor regression and hypotonia evolving into spasticity. The neuroradiologic hallmark of the disease is represented by progressive cerebellar atrophy. Prior to the discovery of mutations in the PLA2G6 gene in family with INAD, the clinical diagnosis of the disease had been confirmed by the presence of spheroid bodies (SB) in a peripheral nerve biopsy. Various studies have found that some patients with mutations lacked SB and some without mutations had SB, indicating incomplete detection using either pathologic or molecular methods7. This, together with the observation that the spectrum of clinical features associated with mutations in PLA2G6 is broader than previously described, has increased the usefulness of Magnetic Resonance (MR) in INAD diagnosis, particularly in the frequent occurrence of atypical cases, especially in the early stages of the disease. We retrospectively reviewed the MR studies of eight patients in whom clinical and imaging onset met the typical criteria for INAD. Their clinical and MR imaging (MRI) onset and follow-up were evaluated together with the neuroradiological findings reported in the literature in order to identify MRI features useful in differentiating INAD from other diseases with similar clinical onset and to discuss which of them are the most important, thus suggesting INAD diagnosis. Our contribution included the use of Proton Spectroscopy (1H-MR), diffusion weighted MR imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the follow-up of seven of the eight patients. The literature reviewed included attempts to correlate clinical and MR data with the genotype in the group of patients carrying PLA2G6 mutations. From the limited and inhomogeneous cohort of patients included in our study, a correlation between the MR features, phenotype and genotype was not exhaustive.

AB  - We are developing a simulator of peripheral nerve block utilizing a mixed-reality approach: the combination of a physical model, an MRI-derived virtual model, mechatronics and spatial tracking. Our design uses tangible (physical) interfaces to simulate surface anatomy, haptic feedback during needle insertion, mechatronic display of muscle twitch corresponding to the specific nerve stimulated, and visual and haptic feedback for the injection syringe. The twitch response is calculated incorporating the sensed output of a real neurostimulator. The virtual model is isomorphic with the physical model and is derived from segmented MRI data. This model provides the subsurface anatomy and, combined with electromagnetic tracking of a sham ultrasound probe and a standard nerve block needle, supports simulated ultrasound display and measurement of needle location and proximity to nerves and vessels. The needle tracking and virtual model also support objective performance metrics of needle targeting technique.

AB  - Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common peripheral neuropathies. For evaluation of the CTS, segmentation of carpal tunnel and its contents from magnetic resonance (MR) images is rather important. In this paper we propose a new segmentation framework for the flexor tendons within the carpal tunnel on MR images. The proposed method consists of two stages including construction of reference tendon contour (RTC) and registration-based segmentation. Initially, we segment the flexor tendons from the most proximally cross-sectional image using watershed algorithm. The resulting segmented tendons then serve as the RTCs and are applied to the registration-based segmentation stage. Each of the RTCs in this stage is registered to its distally adjacent image by a rigid transformation and then its shape is refined by snake deformation. The registration-based segmentation is sequentially performed on each pair of adjacent cross-sectional images along the proximal to distal direction until the most distal image is segmented. Consequently, the flexor tendons in the entire MR volume can be automatically segmented. In the experiments three MR volumes were used to validate the accuracy of the proposed method. Compared to the manual results, our proposed method showed good agreement on the tendon segmentations with dice similarity coefficient above 0.8. ©2010 IEEE.

AB  - Biallelic mutations in the gene encoding HCLS-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) cause autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Some of these patients have neurological abnormalities including developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and/or epilepsy. Recent genotype-phenotype studies have shown that mutations in HAX1 affecting transcripts A (NM_006118.3) and B (NM_001018837.1) cause the phenotype of SCN with neurological impairment, while mutations affecting isoform A but not B lead to SCN without neurological aberrations. In this study, we identified a consanguineous family with two patients suffering from SCN and neurological disease caused by a novel, homozygous genomic deletion including exons 4-7 of the HAX1 gene. Quantitative MRI analyses showed generalized alterations in cerebral proton density in both of the patients, as well as in an additional unrelated patient with another HAX1 mutation (Arg86X) known to be associated with neurological manifestations. This study provides first in vivo evidence of aberrant neuroimaging findings associated with HAX1 deficiency in SCN patients. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

These imply new therapeutic targets, which are beginning to be tested in animal models of MS as well as in patients. What the reader will gain: The reader will learn about some recent advances in understanding MS, especially the evolution from an inflammatory phase to a neurodegenerative phase, which have different therapeutic approaches. Take home message: MS has a long-term course of accumulating deficit in which neuroinflammation evolves into neurodegeneration, which require different treatment strategies immune modulation and neuroprotection. Neuroprotective strategies are still under development. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - High-resolution ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the two imaging methods of choice for the study of peripheral nerves. The many advances that have been made in recent years, either by US or MR imaging, including diffusion tensor imaging and tractography, offer new perspectives for the assessment of many pathological processes affecting peripheral nerves such as entrapment syndromes, tumors and tumor-like lesions, and traumatic disorders. Most of these improvements have especially increased the spatial resolution of nerve imaging. US and MR imaging are complementary, each having advantages and disadvantages. Tractography is still emerging in the musculoskeletal field, particularly for the analysis of peripheral nerves, but this technique seems promising.

AB  - Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows the directional dependence of water diffusion to be studied. Analysis of the resulting image data allows for the determination of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), as well as allowing three-dimensional visualization of the fiber tract (tractography). We visualized the ulnar nerve of ten healthy volunteers with DTI. We found FA to be 0.752 ±0.067 and the ADC to be 0.96 ± 0.13×10-3 mm2/s. A nuts-and-bolts description of the physical aspects of DTI is provided as an educational process for readers. © 2010 ISS.

AB  - Alpha-synuclein aggregation is a neuropathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), collectively termed the α-synucleinopathies. Substantial advances in clinical criteria and neuroimaging technology over the last 20. years have allowed great strides in the detection and differential diagnosis of these disorders. Nevertheless, it is clear that whilst the array of different imaging modalities in clinical use allow for a robust diagnosis of α-synucleinopathy in comparison to healthy subjects, there is no clear diagnostic imaging marker that affords a reliable differential diagnosis between the different forms of Lewy body disease (LBD) or that could facilitate tracking of disease progression. This has led to a call for a biomarker based on the pathological hallmarks of these diseases, namely α-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies (LBs). This potentially may be advantageous in terms of early disease detection, but may also be leveraged into a potential marker of disease progression. We here aim to firstly review the current status of neuroimaging biomarkers in PD and related synucleinopathies. Secondly, we outline the rationale behind α-synuclein imaging as a potential novel biomarker as well as the potential benefits and limitations of this approach. Thirdly, we attempt to illustrate the likely technical hurdles to be overcome to permit successful in vivo imaging of α-synuclein pathology in the diseased brain. Our overriding aim is to provide a framework for discussion of how to address this major unmet clinical need. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background. Functional assessments of the heart by dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) commonly rely on (i) electrocardiographic (ECG) gating yielding pseudo real-time cine representations, (ii) balanced gradient-echo sequences referred to as steady-state free precession (SSFP), and (iii) breath holding or respiratory gating. Problems may therefore be due to the need for a robust ECG signal, the occurrence of arrhythmia and beat to beat variations, technical instabilities (e.g., SSFP "banding" artefacts), and limited patient compliance and comfort. Here we describe a new approach providing true real-time CMR with image acquisition times as short as 20 to 30 ms or rates of 30 to 50 frames per second. Methods. The approach relies on a previously developed real-time MR method, which combines a strongly undersampled radial FLASH CMR sequence with image reconstruction by regularized nonlinear inversion. While iterative reconstructions are currently performed offline due to limited computer speed, online monitoring during scanning is accomplished using gridding reconstructions with a sliding window at the same frame rate but with lower image quality. Results. Scans of healthy young subjects were performed at 3 T without ECG gating and during free breathing. The resulting images yield T1 contrast (depending on flip angle) with an opposed-phase or in-phase condition for water and fat signals (depending on echo time). They completely avoid (i) susceptibility-induced artefacts due to the very short echo times, (ii) radiofrequency power limitations due to excitations with flip angles of 10° or less, and (iii) the risk of peripheral nerve stimulation due to the use of normal gradient switching modes. For a section thickness of 8 mm, real-time images offer a spatial resolution and total acquisition time of 1.5 mm at 30 ms and 2.0 mm at 22 ms, respectively. Conclusions. Though awaiting thorough clinical evaluation, this work describes a robust and flexible acquisition and reconstruction technique for real-time CMR at the ultimate limit of this technology. © 2010 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Adenosine and its receptors play different roles in normal and patho-physiological conditions. For these reasons, many laboratories have focused their attention on dissecting the molecular pathway underlying the mechanism of action of this nucleoside with the final goal being to design new drugs. Wide expression and overlapping functions have been the major problems to designing specific adenosine agonists and antagonists with few associated negative side effects. Engineered mice have helped to dissect the single adenosine receptor function in specific tissues and pathological conditions. All these efforts in the last 20 years have led to the design of more than 2000 compounds, some of them now in clinical trials for treating different pathologies. In this review, we highlight the mouse animal models that have been of use in designing new selective drugs as well as discuss the main adenosine receptor ligands in clinical trials. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Brain death (BD) should be understood as the ultimate clinical expression of a brain catastrophe characterized by a complete and irreversible neurological stoppage, recognized by irreversible coma, absent brainstem reflexes, and apnea. The most common pattern is manifested by an elevation of intracranial pressure to a point beyond the mean arterial pressure, and hence cerebral perfusion pres-sure falls and, as a result, no net cerebral blood flow is present, in due course leading to permanent cytotoxic injury of the intracranial neuronal tissue. A second mechanism is an intrinsic injury affecting the nervous tissue at a cellular level which, if extensive and unremitting, can also lead to BD. We review here the methodology of diagnosing death, based on finding any of the signs of death. The irreversible loss of cardio-circulatory and respiratory functions can cause death only when ischemia and anoxia are prolonged enough to produce an irreversible destruction of the brain. The sign of such loss of brain functions, that is to say BD diagnosis, is fully reviewed. © C. Machado 2010.

AB  - The need for non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerves that can reliably assess extent of nerve fiber degeneration and regeneration is increasingly realized. Availability of such a technology has several immediate clinical and preclinical applications. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an emerging magnetic resonance based technology that is particularly suited for imaging nerve fiber tracts. This review highlights immediate clinical and preclinical uses of non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerve regeneration and DTI as a potential technology that can fulfill these clinical and research needs. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Development of outcome measures to assess ongoing nerve regeneration in the living animal that can be translated to human can provide extremely useful tools for monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions to promote nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance based technique, provides image contrast for nerve tracts and can be applied serially on the same subject with potential to monitor nerve fiber content. In this study, we examined the use of ex vivo high-resolution DTI for imaging intact and regenerating peripheral nerves in mice and correlated the MRI findings with electrophysiology and histology. DTI was done on sciatic nerves with crush, without crush, and after complete transection in different mouse strains. DTI measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA), parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity were acquired and compared in segments of uninjured and crushed/transected nerves and correlated with morphometry. A comparison of axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush showed a comparable pattern of regeneration in different mice strains. FA values were significantly lower in completely denervated nerve segments compared to uninjured sciatic nerve and this signal was restored toward normal in regenerating nerve segments (crushed nerves). Histology data indicate that the FA values and the parallel diffusivity showed a positive correlation with the total number of regenerating axons. These studies suggest that DTI is a sensitive measure of axon regeneration in mouse models and provide basis for further development of imaging technology for application to living animals and humans. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The assessment of human peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles by means of diffusion tensor imaging and tractograpy has been a recent area of research. These techniques have been successfully applied in both volunteers and patients, providing non-invasively, quantitative microstructural parameters (mainly mean fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient) and offering a three-dimensional visualization tool of nerves and muscles fibers. DTI and tractography may reveal abnormalities that are beyond the resolution of conventional MR techniques and hence open the way to potential clinical applications. In this article, we will first summarize the current state of DTI and tractography in the evaluation of peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles as well as their potential future clinical applications. Then, we will address important technical considerations, which understanding is necessary to appropriately apply DTI and tractograhy, and in order to understand the current limitations of these innovative and promising techniques. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and potential clinical applications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography in the normal and pathologic brachial plexus prospectively. Methods: Six asymptomatic volunteers and 12 patients with symptoms related to the brachial plexus underwent DTI on a 1.5T system in addition to the routine anatomic plexus imaging protocol. Maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and of fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as tractography of the brachial plexus were obtained. Images were evaluated by two experienced neuroradiologists in a prospective fashion. Three patients underwent surgery, and nine patients underwent conservative medical treatment. Results: Reconstructed DTI (17/18) were of good quality (one case could not be reconstructed due to artifacts). In all volunteers and in 11 patients, the roots and the trunks were clearly delineated with tractography. Mean FA and mean ADC values were as follows: 0.30±0.079 and 1.70±0.35 mm2/s in normal fibers, 0.22±0.04 and 1.49±0.49 mm2/s in benign neurogenic tumors, and 0.24±0.08 and 1.51±0.52 mm 2/s in malignant tumors, respectively. Although there was no statistically significant difference in FA and ADC values of normal fibers and fibers at the level of pathology, tractography revealed major differences regarding fiber architecture. In benign neurogenic tumors (n=4), tractography revealed fiber displacement alone (n=2) or fiber displacement and encasement by the tumor (n=2), whereas in the malignant tumors, either fiber disruption/destruction with complete disorganization (n=6) or fiber displacement (n=1) were seen. In patients with fiber displacement alone, surgery confirmed the tractography findings, and excision was successful without sequelae. Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that DTI with tractography is feasible in a clinical routine setting. DTI may demonstrate normal tracts, tract displacement, deformation, infiltration, disruption, and disorganization of fibers due to tumors located within or along the brachial plexus, therefore, yielding additional information to the current standard anatomic imaging protocols. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Specific Imaging Findings MRI using T2-weighted sequences is the imaging method of choice, particularly with gradient-recalled echo T2* techniques. Susceptibility effects induced by superficial siderosis (SS) are more obvious at 3.0 T than at 1.5 T. A black line follows the contour of the cerebellum, medulla, pons, and midbrain and to a lesser extent the supratentorial regions such as the temporal lobes (particularly the sylvian and interhemispheric fissures). The cisternal portions of the cranial nerves may also appear dark. The surface of the spinal cord can also show SS. The cerebellum commonly shows atrophy particularly in its vermis and the anterior aspects of the hemispheres. The cerebral hemispheres may also be atrophic. Occasionally, dystrophic calcifications develop in areas of chronic SS, which is better seen on CT. Contrast enhancement may rarely occur. The most important role of imaging is to look for the underlying cause of SS. If the brain study does not reveal obvious causes the next step is spinal MRI. If all MRI studies are non-conclusive a myelogram and post-myelogram CT may be done to identify causes of CSF leak in spinal axis. Occasionally cerebral and spinal angiography may be used as the last resort in attempting to find out the reason for SS. Pertinent Clinical InformationClassically, SS presents in adults with progressive gait ataxia and other cerebellar abnormalities as well as sensorineural hearing loss and other cranial nerve deficits. Pyramidal signs and loss of bladder control are observed in a small number of patients and at the end of the disease, dementia will develop in about 25% of patients. SS should be excluded in all patients with signs of cerebellar degeneration. CSF analysis may reveal xanthochromia, high iron concentrations, red blood cells and increased proteins. The peripheral nervous system is not affected but involvement of spinal nerve roots may give rise to conflicting clinical symptoms. © Cambridge University Press 2012.

AB  - Objective: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) recently identified structural abnormalities of corticomotoneurons in asymptomatic copper/zinc superoxide-dismutase-1 (SOD-1) gene mutation carriers. The potential existence of longstanding corticomotoneuronal dysfunction would clearly have consequences for the medical management of asymptomatic SOD-1 mutation carriers. To clarify this unexpected finding, DTI techniques were combined with threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess the anatomical and functional integrity of corticomotoneurons in asymptomatic SOD-1 mutation carriers. Methods: TMS studies were undertaken using a 90 mm circular coil on seven asymptomatic SOD-1 mutation carriers and results were compared to 62 healthy controls. DTI studies were carried out using a 3 T magnetic resonance device in the same asymptomatic SOD-1 mutation carriers. Results were compared to age-matched healthy controls. Results: In contrast to previous findings, there were no significant differences in fractional anisotropy (SOD-1 mutation carriers, 0.62 ± 0.01; controls, 0.61 ± 0.02, P= 0.2) and trace apparent diffusion coefficient (SOD-1 mutation carriers, 0.003 ± 0.0001; controls, 0.003 ± 0.0001) in asymptomatic SOD-1 mutation carriers. Of further relevance, there were no significant differences in short-interval intracortical inhibition (SOD-1 mutation carriers, 7.9 ± 3.4%; controls, 8.5 ± 1.1%, P= 0.26), intracortical facilitation (P= 0.5), MEP amplitude (P= 0.44), resting motor threshold (P= 0.36) and cortical silent period duration (P= 0.29). Conclusions: Combined anatomical and functional modalities established normal integrity of corticomotoneurons in asymptomatic SOD-1 mutation carrier subjects. Significance: Additional factors other than simply SOD-1 mutation expression are required to trigger cortical hyperexcitability and neurodegeneration in FALS. © 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to determine the intrasubject side-to-side variability of quantitative and qualitative measures of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography of the median nerves and to determine the precision of quantitative measurements and fiber tractography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifteen healthy volunteers (seven men, eight women; mean age, 31.2 years) underwent DTI of both wrists with a single-shot spin-echo-based echoplanar imaging sequence (TR/TE, 7,000/103; b value 1,025 s/mm2). Postprocessing included fiber tractography and quantitative analysis of fiber length, fiber density index, fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, and signal-to-noise ratio. Two readers in consensus graded the quality of fiber tract images of the two wrists as equal, slightly different, or very different. Fiber tractography and all analyses were repeated after 3 weeks, and the images from the two sessions were compared. RESULTS. No statistically significant side-to-side differences in quantitative data were found (p = 0.054-0.999). In all subjects, the quality of fiber tract images of the right and left median nerves was either slightly or very different. Between the initial and the second quantitative analyses, no statistically significant differences (p = 0.086-0.898) were found, and the quality of fiber tract images was rated equal for nine of 15 subjects (60%) and slightly different for six of 15 subjects (40%). CONCLUSION. Preliminary results indicate that quantitative evaluation of DTI of the median nerve is precise. The absence of statistically significant intrasubject side-to-side variability in quantitative data suggests that the healthy contralateral nerve can be used as an internal control. Observed side-to-side variability in the quality of fiber tract images, however, rules out side-to-side comparisons in fiber tractography. © American Roentgen Ray Society.

AB  - Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) typically affects young, healthy children who develop rapid-onset severe encephalopathy triggered by viral infections. This disease is more commonly reported in Japan but occurs worldwide, although it remains under-recognized in Western countries. An autosomal dominant form, ANE1, was recently identified. We report the details of a 9-year-old Caucasian female who experienced recurrent ANE episodes at the ages of 9 months and 9 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were characteristic of ANE during both episodes, although more extensive in the recent episode, which resulted in severe neurological sequelae; influenza A was identified on bronchoalveolar lavage during this episode. Interestingly, there was evidence of peripheral polyneuropathy during the recent episode, which has not previously been described in sporadic ANE. Both the patient and her mother, who had also had postviral polyneuritis in the past, harbour a mutation in Ran-binding protein 2 (RANBP2); this occurred de novo in the mother and confers genetic susceptibility to ANE. Our case suggests that recurrent disease and/or an expanded clinical phenotype raises the possibility of ANE1; positive family history, although supportive, is not necessary as the mutation can occur de novo. Increased awareness may lead to earlier recognition and better treatment options. © The Authors. Journal compilation © Mac Keith Press 2009.

AB  - Globoid cell leukodystrophy is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase. In both human patients and the authentic murine Twitcher model, pathological findings include demyelination as well as axonal damage in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has emerged as a powerful noninvasive technique that is sensitive to these white matter disease processes. Increases in radial diffusivity (λ⊥) and decreases in axial diffusivity (λ∥) correlate with histopathological evidence of demyelination and axonal damage, respectively. Compared to age-matched, normal littermates, DTI of optic nerve and trigeminal nerve in end-stage Twitcher mice displayed a statistically significant increase in λ⊥ and decrease in λ∥, consistent with previously characterized demyelination and axonal damage in these regions. In the Twitcher spinal cord, a statistically significant decrease in λ∥ was identified in both the dorsal and ventrolateral white matter, relative to normal controls. These results were consistent with immunofluorescence evidence of axonal damage in these areas as detected by staining for nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI32). Increase in λ⊥ in Twitcher spinal cord white matter relative to normal controls reached statistical significance in the dorsal columns and approached statistical significance in the ventrolateral region. Correlative reduced levels of myelin basic protein were detected by immunofluorescent staining in both these white matter regions in the Twitcher spinal cord. Fractional anisotropy, a nonspecific but sensitive indicator of white matter disease, was significantly reduced in the optic nerve, trigeminal nerve, and throughout the spinal cord white matter of Twitcher mice, relative to normal controls. This first reported application of spinal cord DTI in the setting of GLD holds potential as a noninvasive, quantitative assay of therapeutic efficacy in future treatment studies.

AB  - Every year, manufacturers of MRI machines introduce new sequences. Most of them result in improved spatial resolution and signal contrast, occasionally with a decrease in sequence duration or MRI time (as when a single 3D sequence is substituted for three 2D sequences). Some sequences that are specifically designed to obtain structural or functional information about a specific tissue (ultrashort TE, T2 mapping, spectro-MRI) are used only for research purposes. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and tractography constitute an original microarchitectural approach based on water molecule diffusion. These methods are nearly ready to be introduced into clinical practice. They are discussed in this article. © 2009.

AB  - Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (ILP) (2 mg, TNF-alpha and 100 mg, melphalan) was performed for an irresectable right thigh desmoid tumor with calf extension in a 49-year-old man. The patient had a history of four resections since the age of 19 years. Local ILP toxicity appeared with extensive edema and common peroneal neurologic impairment including paresis that remained severe 10 months later. One of the most troublesome side effects of perfusion is peripheral nerve damage, which has been reported at a rate of between 1 and 48% of perfused patients. ILP is an effective treatment in recurrence situations or where resection threatens loss of function; it, however, requires administration in specialized centers, progress in standardization and close monitoring to avoid locoregional toxicity, the mechanisms of which merit further investigation. Emergency compartmental pressure measurement may indicate fasciotomy, can be of great interest. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Methods were invented that made it possible to image peripheral nerves in the body and to image neural tracts in the brain. The history, physical basis, and dyadic tensor concept underlying the methods are reviewed. Over a 15-year period, these techniques - magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and diffusion tensor imaging - were deployed in the clinical and research community in more than 2500 published research reports and applied to approximately 50 000 patients. Within this group, approximately 5000 patients having MRN were carefully tracked on a prospective basis. METHODS: A uniform Neurography imaging methodology was applied in the study group, and all images were reviewed and registered by referral source, clinical indication, efficacy of imaging, and quality. Various classes of image findings were identified and subjected to a variety of small targeted prospective outcome studies. Those findings demonstrated to be clinically significant were then tracked in the larger clinical volume data set. RESULTS: MRN demonstrates mechanical distortion of nerves, hyperintensity consistent with nerve irritation, nerve swelling, discontinuity, relations of nerves to masses, and image features revealing distortion of nerves at entrapment points. These findings are often clinically relevant and warrant full consideration in the diagnostic process. They result in specific pathological diagnoses that are comparable to electrodiagnostic testing in clinical efficacy. A review of clinical outcome studies with diffusion tensor imaging also shows convincing utility. CONCLUSION: MRN and diffusion tensor imaging neural tract imaging have been validated as indispensable clinical diagnostic methods that provide reliable anatomic pathological information. There is no alternative diagnostic method in many situations. With the elapsing of 15 years, tens of thousands of imaging studies, and thousands of publications, these methods should no longer be considered experimental.

AB  - Pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for up to 5% of all MS cases. Work conducted over the past 5 years has provided new information about the treatment, pathogenesis, demographics, and natural history of this disorder. Genetic and environmental factors seem to exert critical influences on its development. Clinical, MRI and laboratory data from prepubertal and postpubertal children suggest differences between the immune response and/or CNS environment in younger compared with older children and adults with MS. Randomized, controlled treatment trials for pediatric MS have not yet been performed, but therapies used in adult MS have been evaluated in this population, and their use seems to be safe. This article provides a comprehensive review of current knowledge regarding pediatric MS, highlighting new advances in the field.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory bowel disease believed to develop as a result of the stimulation of a dysfunctional immune response in genetically susceptible individuals. Croh'n disease is most commonly diagnosed in young adults (15 to 30 years) with a female-to-male ratio between unity and 1.2: 1. Prevalence of Crohn's disease rapidly increased all through the world as different countries adopt a Western lifestyle. The incidence is 5.8 cases per 100,000 people per year and the prevalence is 133 cases per 100,000 people. Mortality in Crohn's disease is now low, but morbidity is considerable. Thirty to sixty per cent of patients with Crohn's disease who attain medically induced remission will relapse within 1 year. It is estimated that 50% and 75% of Crohn's disease patients will require surgery within 5 to 15 years of diagnosis. Surgical resection is not curative as evidenced by the near universal recurrence of neo-terminal ileal Crohn's disease following ileocolonic resection. In the absence of a definitive cure, the aim of therapy is to induce and maintain clinical remission at an acceptable cost, avoidance of surgeries, and improvement of health-related quality of life. The first line treatment is still based on combinations of steroids, amino-salicylic acid derivatives, imunomodulators, and nutritional regimens. Biological drugs have opened new therapeutic horizons for treating Crohn's disease, but have also brought with them issues related to immunogenicity, long-term efficacy, safety and cost. This review will highlight the current advances in the management of Crohn's disease as well as discuss areas that remain controversial and are awaiting resolution. © 2009 DAR Publishers/University of Jordan.

AB  - Background: Quantitative fiber tracking derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to determine whether white matter association, projection, or commissural tracts are affected in nondemented individuals with HIV infection and to identify the regional distribution of sparing and impairment of fiber systems. Methods: DTI measured fractional anisotropy and diffusivity, quantified separately for longitudinal (λ L) diffusivity (index of axonal injury) and transverse (λ T) diffusivity (index of myelin injury), in 11 association and projection white matter tracts and six commissural tracts in 29 men and 13 women with HIV infection and 88 healthy, age-matched controls (42 men and 46 women). Results: The total group of HIV-infected individuals had higher diffusivity (principally longitudinal) than controls in the posterior sectors of the corpus callosum, internal and external capsules, and superior cingulate bundles. High longitudinal diffusivity, indicative of axonal compromise, was especially prominent in posterior callosal sectors, fornix, and superior cingulate bundle in HIV with AIDS. Unmedicated patients had notably high transverse diffusivity, indicative of myelin compromise, in the occipital forceps, inferior cingulate bundle, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Pontocerebellar projection fibers were resistant to HIV effects as were commissural fibers coursing through premotor and sensorimotor callosal sectors. Conclusion: This quantitative survey of brain fiber tract integrity indicates that even nondemented HIV patients can have neuroradiological evidence for damage to association and commissural tracts. These abnormalities were vulnerable to exacerbation with AIDS and possibly mitigated by HAART. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Acquired copper deficiency in adults is associated with a subacute to chronic progressive myeloneuropathy and optic neuropathy. Objective: To describe an individual after gastric bypass surgery who developed a chronic progressive myeloneuropathy, an acute optic neuropathy, along with anemia and leukopenia. Design: Case report. Setting: Academic center. Patient: A 55-year-old woman, following gastric bypass surgery 22 years earlier, developed progressive numbness, weakness, and sphincter disturbance over 6 years. She awoke one morning with bilateral blindness. Examination findings showed evidence of severe myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Main Outcome Measures: Magnetic resonance imaging, optical coherence tomography, electrophysiologic studies, nerve and muscle biopsy specimens, and vision testing. Results: Over 1 year of follow-up, copper infusion therapy seemed to stabilize the progressive myeloneuropathy and improved leukopenia and anemia. It had no effect on the optic neuropathy. Optic nerve tissue injury was observed on magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and on optical coherence tomography. Conclusions: Copper deficiency should be considered in cases of atypical optic neuropathy. Serum copper levels should be monitored in patients with a compatible neurologic syndrome who have undergone gastric bypass surgery. Although visual acuity did not improve after copper infusion in our patient, prompt recognition of copper deficiency may prevent further deterioration. ©2009 American Medical Association.

AB  - Background: The onset of progressive cerebellar ataxia in early childhood is considered a key feature of ataxiatelangiectasia (A-T), accompanied by ocular apraxia, telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, cancer susceptibility and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Methods: We describe the clinical features and course of three Mennonite children who were diagnosed with A-T following the completion of therapy for lymphoid malignancies. Results: Prior to cancer therapy, all had non-progressive atypical neurological abnormalities, with onset by age 30 months, including dysarthria, dyskinesia, hypotonia and/or dystonia, without telangiectasias. Cerebellar ataxia was noted in only one of the children and was mild until his death at age eight years. None had severe infections. All three children were "cured" of their lymphoid malignancies, but experienced severe adverse effects from the treatments administered. The two children who received cranial irradiation developed supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the brain, an association not previously described, with fatal outcomes. Conclusions: The range of neurological presentations of A-T is broad. Ataxia and telangiectasias may be minimal or absent and the course seemingly non-progressive. The diagnosis of A-T should be considered in all children with neuromotor dysfunction or peripheral neuropathy, particularly those who develop lymphoid malignancies. The consequences of missing the diagnosis may be dire. Radiation therapy and radiomimetic drugs should be avoided in individuals with A-T.

AB  - Object. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of assessing lumbar somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in central lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Methods. The latencies of lumbar SSEPs were recorded in 40 patients with central LSS, including 16 men and 24 women. The mean age of the patients was 67.3 ± 7.4 years. The diagnosis was LSS in 23 cases and LSS associated with degenerative spondylolisthesis in 17 cases. The average duration of symptoms was 43.8 ± 51.2 months. Twenty-two cases had bilateral and 18 cases had unilateral leg symptoms. Thirty-seven cases were associated with neurogenic intermittent claudication and the mean walking distance of patients with this condition was 246.8 ± 232.7 m. The mean Japanese Orthopedic Association scale score, as well as the visual analog scale (VAS) scores of low-back pain, leg pain, and numbness, were 16.5 ± 3.5, 6.0 ± 2.5, 6.9 ± 2.1, and 7.8 ± 2.2, respectively. The minimal cross-sectional area of the dural sac on MR imaging was 0.44 ± 0.21 cm2. Thirty-nine cases of cervical spondylotic myelopathy without lumbar and peripheral neuropathy were chosen as the control group. Results. The latencies of lumbar SSEPs in patients with LSS and in the control group were 23.0 ± 2.0 ms and 21.6 ± 1.9 ms, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the LSS and control groups (p &lt; 0.05). The latency of lumbar SSEPs was significant correlated with the VAS score of leg numbness (p &lt; 0.05). The latency of lumbar SSEPs in LSS was clearly delayed when the VAS score of leg numbness was ≥ 8 (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions. Lumbar SSEPs are able to detect neurological deficit in the lumbar area effectively, and they can reflect part of the subjective severity of sensory disturbance (numbness) in LSS. Both lumbar SSEPs and VAS scores of leg numbness may be useful for clinical evaluation in patients with LSS.

AB  - An in depth analysis of the reliability of ultrasonography to measure the cross-sectional area of the tibial nerve or any other peripheral nerve is not available in the literature. This study determined the reliability and size of the measurement error of high-resolution ultrasound to measure the size of the tibial nerve at the tarsal tunnel. The cross-sectional area of the tibial nerve was measured by two experienced sonographers at 1 cm proximal to the medial malleolus. Measurements were made in 10 healthy participants without plantar heel pain. Intra and intertester reliability were determined by calculation of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), measurement error magnitude and smallest detectable difference (SDD). A direct (tracing) and indirect (ellipsoid formula) method were evaluated. Results demonstrated that the intra and intertester reliability were excellent (ICC, all ≥0.86). The measurement error and SDD were very small, especially when measurements from three scans were averaged (measurement error: 0.4-0.9 mm2; SDD: 1.1-2.5 mm2). The findings of this study support the view that high-resolution ultrasound is reliable to measure the cross-sectional area of a peripheral nerve. As a result of the small measurement error, a side-to-side difference as small as ∼1.8 mm2 can be interpreted meaningfully in an individual patient. This difference is much smaller than the swelling reported in the literature for patients with tibial neuropathy.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) for neural fibers of the head-and-neck region at 3T has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using DTT for visualizing neural fibers in the head-and-neck region at 3T and to explore the use of this method in patients with head-and-neck mass lesions. Materials and Methods: Using a 3T scanner, we obtained magnetic resonance images of the head and neck region in 5 healthy volunteers and 5 patients with head and neck mass lesions. All subjects underwent anatomic T1-weighted and diffusion-tensor imaging using a sequence with six motion-probing gradient orientations, a b value of 800 second/mm2, and a 128 × 128 pixel matrix. Fiber tracking was with the continuous tracking method. Different postprocessing parameters were investigated to optimize fiber density detection and minimize noise. In five patients with head-and-neck mass lesions, comparison of tractography results and operative findings with regards to mass and nerve relationship was also performed by two observers. Results: Using the two regions-of-interest method, the greatest fiber density of presumed inferior alveolar nerves was depicted at a maximum angle of 40° and a minimum fiber length of 10 mm. DTT was successfully depicted in all 5 patients. In 4 patients, the relationship between DTT and operative findings was coincided or similar. The interobserver agreement was good. Conclusions: DTT of the neural fibers in the head and neck region is feasible using a clinical 3T magnetic resonance scanner. Data from a small number of patients with head-and-neck lesions show good agreement between tractography and operative results. © 2009 AUR.

AB  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic infection of the brain caused by the JC-virus. Both a decreased cellular or humoral immune response can increase the susceptibility for JC-virus induced PML. Not only HIV infected people are at risk, a wide range of otherwise immune compromised patients are a potential target for this virus. This report of five PML patients shows the importance of a clinician's familiarity with this disease and it's presenting symptoms. The presenting symptoms of PML can sometimes mimic worsening of the underlying disease. Although different therapeutic strategies have been tried, the outcomes remain very poor. In this series, treatment with cidofovir appears not to be effective in treating PML, neither in HIV positive nor HIV negative patients. Experimental therapy with leflunomide, after tapering of the immunosuppressive medication, did change the natural course of PML in one patient. © 2008 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

AB  - This article examines the T2 relaxation characteristics of the median nerve. Knowledge of the T2 relaxation time is essential to optimize clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and to enhance the visibility of pathophysiological changes in tissues. The T2 relaxation time of the median nerve is short relative to the T2 of other tissues like white and gray matter, for instance, and it decreases with increasing field strength of the MR scanner. A T2 relaxation time of ∼50 milliseconds (ms) and ∼20 ms were reported at 1.5 T and 7 T, respectively. Detailed measurements at 3.0 T revealed a biexponential decay characterized by two T2 components, at ∼30 ms and ∼100 ms, with normalized amplitudes of ∼80% and ∼20%, respectively. These two components possibly result from spatial compartmentation of water into intra-axonal and interaxonal spaces. The ability to assess microanatomical compartments within the median nerve could provide a method to study in vivo biophysical properties of nerves and could offer a means to investigate neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The median nerve is one of the most commonly affected peripheral nerves in various pathologies such as entrapment syndromes or transections. The diagnostic procedures applied in these situations are electromyography, physical examination methods, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used mostly in imaging the central nervous system (CNS) to visualize white matter tracts. Several studies have shown the clinical applications of DTI in neuronal disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and CNS tumors. Recently, peripheral nerves have been visualized with DTI. Also, in several pathologies such as carpal tunnel syndrome and transection of the median nerve, on postoperative follow-up anisotropy indexes were shown to be affected. However, new studies with larger series are needed. Copyright © 2009 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - We applied diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), a recently developed MRI technique that reveals the microstructures of tissues based on its ability to monitor the random movements of water molecules, to the visualization of peripheral nerves after injury. The rat sciatic nerve was subjected to contusive injury, and the data obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to determine the tracks of nerve fibers (DTT). The DTT images obtained using the fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold value of 0.4 clearly revealed the recovery process of the contused nerves. Immediately after the injury, fiber tracking from the designated proximal site could not be continued beyond the lesion epicenter, but the intensity improved thereafter, returning to its pre-injury level by 3 weeks later. We compared the FA value, a parameter computed from the DTT data, with the results of histological and functional examinations of the injured nerves, during recovery. The FA values of the peripheral nerves were more strongly correlated with axon-related (axon density and diameter) than with myelin-related (myelin density and thickness) parameters, supporting the theories that axonal membranes play a major role in anisotropic water diffusion and that myelination can modulate the degree of anisotropy. Moreover, restoration of the FA value at the lesion epicenter was strongly correlated with parameters of motor and sensory functional recovery. These correlations of the FA values with both the histological and functional changes demonstrate the potential usefulness of DTT for evaluating clinical events associated with Wallerian degeneration and the regeneration of peripheral nerves. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Following upper limb peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair, some patients regain good sensorimotor function while others do not. Understanding peripheral and central mechanisms that contribute to recovery may facilitate the development of new therapeutic interventions. Plasticity following peripheral nerve transection has been demonstrated throughout the neuroaxis in animal models of nerve injury. However, the brain changes that occur following peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair in humans have not been examined. Furthermore, the extent to which peripheral nerve regeneration influences functional and structural brain changes has not been characterized. Therefore, we asked whether functional changes are accompanied by grey and/or white matter structural changes and whether these changes relate to sensory recovery? To address these key issues we (i) assessed peripheral nerve regeneration; (ii) measured functional magnetic resonance imaging brain activation (blood oxygen level dependent signal; BOLD) in response to a vibrotactile stimulus; (iii) examined grey and white matter structural brain plasticity; and (iv) correlated sensory recovery measures with grey matter changes in peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair patients. Compared to each patient's healthy contralesional nerve, transected nerves have impaired nerve conduction 1.5 years after transection and repair, conducting with decreased amplitude and increased latency. Compared to healthy controls, peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair patients had altered blood oxygen level dependent signal activity in the contralesional primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, and in a set of brain areas known as the 'task positive network'. In addition, grey matter reductions were identified in several brain areas, including the contralesional primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, in the same areas where blood oxygen level dependent signal reductions were identified. Furthermore, grey matter thinning in the post-central gyrus was negatively correlated with measures of sensory recovery (mechanical and vibration detection) demonstrating a clear link between function and structure. Finally, we identified reduced white matter fractional anisotropy in the right insula in a region that also demonstrated reduced grey matter. These results provide insight into brain plasticity and structure-function-behavioural relationships following nerve injury and have important therapeutic implications.

AB  - Background. The safe performance of regional anaesthesia (RA) requires theoretical knowledge and good manual skills. Virtual reality (VR)-based simulators may offer trainees a safe environment to learn and practice different techniques. However, currently available VR simulators do not consider individual anatomy, which limits their use for realistic training. We have developed a VR-based simulator that can be used for individual anatomy and for different anatomical regions. Methods. Individual data were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) without contrast agent to represent morphology and the vascular system, respectively. For data handling, registration, and segmentation, an application based on the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit was developed. Suitable segmentation algorithms such as the fuzzy c-means clustering approach were integrated, and a hierarchical tree data structure was created to model the flexible anatomical structures of peripheral nerve cords. The simulator was implemented in the VR toolkit ViSTA using modules for collision detection, virtual humanoids, interaction, and visualization. A novel algorithm for electric impulse transmission is the core of the simulation. Results. In a feasibility study, MRI morphology and MRA were acquired from five subjects for the inguinal region. From these sources, three-dimensional anatomical data sets were created and nerves modelled. The resolution obtained from both MRI and MRA was sufficient for realistic simulations. Our high-fidelity simulator application allows trainees to perform virtual peripheral nerve blocks based on these data sets and models. Conclusions. Subject-specific training of RA is supported in a virtual environment. We have adapted segmentation algorithms and developed a VR-based simulator for the inguinal region for use in training for different peripheral nerve blocks. In contrast to available VR-based simulators, our simulation offers anatomical variety.

AB  - Posterior interosseous nerve palsy, also called deep radial nerve syndrome, is a neuropathy caused by radial nerve entrapment or compression at the level of the supinator muscle. Although imaging studies are not necessary for diagnosing this syndrome because of its characteristic clinical manifestations, the causes of palsy, which include mass lesions, or precise anatomical findings can sometimes be demonstrated by imaging. Magnetic resonance (MR) findings of posterior interosseous nerve palsy have been described as involving atrophy of related muscles caused by denervation, a common secondary change of this nerve disorder. We present a case in which the swollen posterior interosseous nerve itself could be directly depicted by MR imaging using a 4.7-cm microscopy coil in a patient with neuropathy. © 2009 Japan Radiological Society.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate manganese (Mn2+)-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as tools for detection of axonal injury and regeneration after intravit-real peripheral nerve graft (PNG) implantation in the rat optic nerve (ON).Materials and Methods: In adult Fischer rats, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival was evaluated in Flurogold (FG) back-filled retinal whole mounts after ON crush (ONC), intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl 2 injection (150 nmol) at 0 and 20 days post lesion (dpl). MEMRI and echo-planar DTI (DTI-EPI) was obtained of noninjured ON one day after intravitreal MnCl2 injection, and at 1 and 21 dpl after ONC, intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl2 injections given at 0 and 20 dpl. GAP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed after the last MRI.Results: ONC reduced RGC density in retina by 94% at 21 dpl compared to noninjured ON without MnCl2 injections. Both intravitreal PNG and intravitreal MnCl2 injections improved RGC survival in retina, which was reduced by 90% (ONC + MnCl 2), 82% (ONC+PNG), and 74% (ONC+PNG+MnCl2) compared to noninjured ON. DTI-derived parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffu-sivity, axial diffusivityλ||,and radial diffusivity λ⊥) were unaffected by the presence of Mn2+ in the ON. At 1 dpl, CNRMEMRI and λ||were reduced at the injury site, while at 21 dpl they were increased at the injury site compared to values measured at 1 dpl. GAP-43 immunoreactive axons were present in the ON distal to the ONC injury site.Conclusion: MEMRI and DTI enabled detection of functional and structural degradation after rat ON injury, and there was correlation between the MRI-derived and immu-nohistochemical measures of axon regeneration. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Neurological injury resulting from cardiac surgery has a range of manifestations from focal neurological deficit to encephalopathy or coma. As the safety of drug-eluting stents comes into question, more patients will likely undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These projections, along with the growing proportions of elderly patients and those with comorbidities, portend the potential for rising rates of perioperative neurological complications. The risk for neurological injury may be determined by the type of procedure, by patient-specific characteristics, and by the extent of cerebral embolization and hypoperfusion during and after surgery. Changes in surgical techniques, including the use of off-pump surgery, have not decreased rates of brain injury from cardiac surgery. When appropriate, modern neuroimaging techniques should be used in postoperative patients to confirm diagnosis, to provide information on potential etiology, to direct appropriate therapy, and to help in prognostication. Management of postoperative medications and early use of rehabilitation services is a recommended strategy to optimize the recovery for individuals with neurological injury after cardiac surgery.

AB  - Perineuroma, rare in children, presents as a painless mononeuropathy of a major nerve trunk. Resection of the lesion with end-to-end sural nerve grafting appears to be the treatment of choice. This technique is not recommended if the unhealthy segment of nerve is too long or if spinal roots are involved. However, in children, reports of direct MR evaluation of nerve trunks and of the exiting nerve roots are limited. We report a 7-year-old girl with an intramural sciatic nerve perineuroma in whom the diagnosis was made by MRI and confirmed by biopsy. The MR protocol combining 3-D T2-W STIR SPACE, fat-saturated gadolinium-enhanced T1-W images, and diffusion tensor imaging with tractography was a valuable tool for depicting peripheral nerve and roots in order to plan surgical treatment. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We have prospectively followed 16 Finnish xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients for up to 23 years. Seven patients were assigned by complementation analysis to the group XP-A, two patients to the XP-C group and one patient to the XP-G group. Six of the seven XP-A patients had the identical mutation (Arg228Ter) and the seventh patient had a different mutation (G283A). Further patients were assigned to complementation groups on the basis of their consanguinity to an XP patient with a known complementation group. The first sign of the disease in all the cases was severe sunburn with minimal sun exposure in early infancy. However, at the time the diagnosis was made in only two cases. The XP-A patients developed neurological and cognitive dysfunction in childhood. The neurological disease advanced in an orderly fashion through its successive stages, finally affecting the whole nervous system and leading to death before the age of 40 years. Dermatological and ocular damage of the XP-A patients tended to be limited. The two XP-C patients were neurologically and cognitively intact despite mild brain atrophy as seen by neuroimaging. The XP-G patients had sensorineural hearing loss, laryngeal dystonia and peripheral neuropathy. The XP-C patients had severe skin and ocular malignancies that first presented at pre-school age. They also showed immunosuppression in cell-mediated immunity. Neurological disease appears to be associated with the complementation group and the failure of fibroblasts to recover RNA synthesis following UV irradiation, but not necessarily to the severity of the dermatological symptoms, the hypersensitivity of fibroblasts to UVB killing or the susceptibility of keratinocytes to UVB-induced apoptosis. © The Author (2008).

AB  - Wallerian degeneration is the degeneration of the nerve fiber distally to damage of the axon. It classically has been described in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), but also takes place in the central nervous system (CNS). Wallerian degeneration in the CNS is much slower than in the PNS taking months to years and a secondary regeneration of the distal nerve fiber does not take place in the CNS. Thus, Wallerian degeneration may be a crucial factor influencing the functional loss after brain damage and can be detected using modern MR technniques. This article reviews the process of Wallerian degeneration in the CNS and the possibilities of imaging Wallerian degeneration in the human brain using MRI. While a decrease of signal intensities in proton-density-weighted images can be detected after 25 days and increased signal intensities in T2-weigthed images can be seen after 80 days, diffusion sensor imaging (DTI) can detect Wallerian degeneration much earlier. Several studies have demonstrated the decrease of fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corticospinal tracts after infarction of the medial cerebral artery (MCA) 2-6 month after stroke, 2-6 weeks after stroke, and 2-16 days after stroke. Moreover, a continuous decrease of FA over time in serial DT measurements after MCA infarction could be demonstrated. Changes in FA seem to be a parameter to quantify degeneration of tracts over time in single, compact fiber bundles such as the corticospinal tract, cerebellar peduncles, spinal cord white matter, the optic radiation, and corpus callosum. Thus, the detection and quantification of Wallerian degeneration may be a tool tor monitoring functional loss or functional regain after brain damage. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To review the literature on the use of brain imaging, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in investigation of the activity in diverse brain regions that creates and modulates chronic neuropathic pain. Data sources: English literatures from January 1, 2000 to July 31, 2007 that examined human brain activity in chronic neuropathic pain were accessed through MEDLINE/CD ROM, using PET, fMRI, VBM, MRS and receptor binding. Study selection: Published articles about the application of fMRI, PET VBM, MRS and chronic neuropathic pain were selected. Data extraction: Data were mainly extracted from 40 representative articles as the research basis. Results: The PET studies suggested that spontaneous neuropathic pain is associated with changes in thalamic activity. Both PET and fMRI have been used to investigate the substrate of allodynia. The VBM demonstrated that brain structural changes are involved in chronic neuropathic pain, which is not seen in a matched control group. However, the results obtained had a large variety, which may be due to different pain etiology, pain distribution, lesion tomography, symptoms and stimulation procedures. Conclusions: Application of the techniques of brain imaging plays a very important role in the study of structural and functional reorganization in patients with neuropathic pain. However, a unique "pain matrix" has not been defined. Future studies should be conducted using a prospective longitudinal research design, which would guarantee the control for many confounding factors.

AB  - Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been shown to provide valuable structural information in biological fibrous soft tissues, such as the central and peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscle, based on the acquisition of a series of images that sample q-space. Existing q-space sampling schemes have been compared using several metrics based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which models the restricted diffusion inside fibres as anisotropic unrestricted diffusion. Otherwise, sampling schemes have been optimized using model-independent cost functions. We propose using a model-based framework that connects the experimental noise, the uncertainty in the estimation of the model parameters, and the q-space sampling schemes together, to obtain model-based optimal sampling schemes for the case when the fibre orientation is known a priori to be within a finite region. We apply and validate this framework for the recently proposed quantitative analysis of q-space MRI data (QUAQ) model. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Peripheral nerve disorders may be classified into compressive or entrapment neuropathies and non-compressive neuropathies. Muscle denervation recognized on MRI may be a useful sign in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve disorders. Acute or subacute denervation results in prolonged T2 relaxation time, producing increased signal in skeletal muscle on short tau inversion-recovery and fat-suppressed T2-weighted images. Chronic denervation produces fatty atrophy of skeletal muscles, resulting in increased muscle signal on T1-weighted images. This review will outline and illustrate the various ways that muscle denervation as seen on MRI may assist in the diagnosis and localization of peripheral nerve disorders. © 2007 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.

AB  - Peripheral nerve tumors are not frequent, but due to their association with a nerve they are somewhat special. They may be encountered incidentally during evaluation of a soft-tissue mass or when a nerve lesion is clinically suspected and the recognition of such a lesion and its differential diagnosis is key for successful therapy and patient prognosis. As sonography is often the first line modality in the work-up of a soft-tissue mass, the sonographer should be aware of the typical features of such lesions in order to arrive at the correct diagnosis, and this article tries to give an overview of the histological subtypes of peripheral nerve tumors and their sonographic characteristics. © Springer-Verlag 2007.

AB  - This article discusses and reviews advanced forms of serial morphometry in the context of a disease progression model in multiple sclerosis (MS). This model of disease activity distinguishes between overall disease activity and the proportion thereof that becomes permanent damage. This translates into a progression model that features a repair potential, which, when exhausted, marks the conversion or progression from relapsing to progressive disease. The level of repair capacity at a given time determines the rate of progression. Both clinical and MRI variables appear to be in support of such a model. We examine possible MRI markers for this repair capacity, particularly the short-term behavior of new MRI lesions, quantified by methods of time-series analysis-that is, capturing lesion dynamics in the form of MRI intensity change directly, rather than shape or volume change. Lower rates of individual lesion recovery may represent lower repair and greater proximity to a progressive stage. Individuals with low transient lesion turnover appear to undergo more rapid progression and atrophy. Because disease-modifying therapies aim to alter the pathophysiological chain of inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss, a therapeutic effect may therefore be more readily apparent as a change in lesion dynamics and recovery rate and level, rather than a change in total lesion burden or enhancing lesion number. © 2007 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

AB  - The ability to measure myelin in vivo has great consequences for furthering our knowledge of normal development, as well as for understanding a wide range of neurological disorders. The following review summarizes the current state of myelin imaging using MR. We consider five MR techniques that have been used to study myelin: 1) conventional MR, 2) MR spectroscopy, 3) diffusion, 4) magnetization transfer, and 5) T2 relaxation. Fundamental studies involving peripheral nerve and MR/histology comparisons have aided in the interpretation and validation of MR data. We highlight a number of important findings related to myelin development, damage, and repair, and we conclude with a critical summary of the current techniques available and their potential to image myelin in vivo. © 2007 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

AB  - Alcohol is a substance that impacts the social, psychological, medical, economic and religious spheres of our existence. It is part of every society. Alcohol in moderation can be beneficial. Alcohol abuse mediates its effects both on the developing and the developed brain, directly or indirectly, and has acute and chronic complications. Damage to the developing brain can result from alcohol consumption in pregnancy. Misuse of alcohol in adults can affect both the central and the peripheral nervous system. Direct effects arise due to the toxic and intoxicating effects of alcohol. Nutritional deficiencies are thought to mediate most of the indirect effects of alcohol, as patients with alcohol dependence tend to eat less and derive most of their caloric intake from the alcoholic beverages they consume. Alcohol-related disease places a burden on our health-care systems. In this review, we examine the pathological effects of alcohol on the nervous system. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The neuroimaging of experimental and clinical pain has revolutionised our understanding of the physiological responses to pain and paved the way for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain syndromes. Extensive research on the central mechanisms regarding the sensory-discriminative dimensions of pain have revealed a complex network of cortical and subcortical brain structures involved in the transmission and integration of pain, the so-called pain matrix. Although brain imaging and pharmacological studies have generated some insight into the circuitry that may be involved in the generation of chronic pain symptoms, further research into brain imaging of chronic pain is clearly warranted. However, modern neuroimaging suggests that the chronification of pain (and headaches) involves functional and structural plasticity of both the central and peripheral nervous system. © Springer-VerlagItalia 2007.

AB  - In vitro investigations were performed to study the proton T2 relaxation spectrum of rat optic nerve. Studies in which the nerve was incubated in a D2O-based solution revealed that &gt;98% of the spectrum originated from the water protons. The spectrum was found to consist of three components having relaxation times and sizes similar to those reported in the literature for peripheral nerve. Procedures were taken to confirm the existence of a third optic nerve component and that it was not an artifact of the long-lived water protons of the in vitro incubation solution. Evidence using paramagnetic agents in the incubation solution, which removed the two longest-lived nerve components from the spectrum, revealed the existence of a small fourth component (&lt;10% of total) having a T2 relaxation time similar to that of the intermediate-lived nerve component. Bathingthe nerves in a 10mM glutamate solution, glutamate known to result in cellular swelling in mammalian central nervous system (CNS), was found to increase the component size of the longest-lived nerve component, suggestive that this component may result from cellular water.

AB  - A novel magnetic resonance imaging approach, called diffusion-direction-dependent imaging (DDI), is introduced. Due to inherent anisotropic diffusion properties, peripheral nerves can be visualized on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The largest signal attenuation on DTI correlates with the direction of a nerve fiber, and the least signal attenuation correlates with the direction perpendicular to the nerve fiber. Since low signal-to-noise ratio is a concern in peripheral nerve DTI, we explored a new approach focusing on the perpendicular diffusion direction. A 36-gradient diffusion direction scheme was used. A mean expected curve specific for peripheral nerves was calculated based on the sciatic nerve and its division into the common peroneal nerve and the tibial nerve in three healthy volunteers. By a simple postprocessing method, a comparison of the mean expected curve and the measured curve was made voxel by voxel, and the sciatic nerve and its division were reconstructed, excluding other tissues. More studies are needed to investigate whether other postprocessing methods or other diffusion direction schemes are more suited for peripheral nerve imaging with DDI. Further studies may also be of interest to investigate whether DDI can be a complementary method to conventional T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences in the imaging of peripheral nerve pathology or even in the visualization of other tissues, possibly with different diffusion direction schemes. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A phase II study was conducted to assess the efficacy of administering daily thalidomide concomitantly with radiation and continuing for up to 1 year following radiation in children with brain stem gliomas (BSG) or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Secondary objectives were to obtain preliminary evidence of biologic activity of thalidomide and to evaluate toxicities from chronic administration of thalidomide in this population. Thirteen patients (2-14 years old) with newly diagnosed BSG (12 patients) or GBM (one patient) were enrolled between July 1999 and June 2000. All patients received focal radiotherapy to a total dose of 5,580 cGy. Thalidomide was administered once daily beginning on the first day of radiation and continued for 12 months or until the patient came off study. The starting dose was 12 mg/kg (rounded down to the nearest 50 mg) and was increased by 20% weekly, if tolerated, to 24 mg/kg or 1,000 mg (whichever was lower). Advanced imaging techniques and urine and serum analysis for anti-angiogenic markers were performed in some patients in an attempt to correlate changes with clinical effect of therapy. No patients completed the planned 12 months of thalidomide therapy and all have since died of disease progression. The median duration of therapy was 5 months (range 2-11 months). Nine patients came off study for progressive disease (PD), three patients due to toxicity and one patient withdrew consent. Several patients on this study required more extended courses of high dose steroids than would have been otherwise expected for this population due to significant peritumoral edema and necrosis. No consistent pattern emerged from the biologic correlative studies from 11 patients. However, advanced imaging with techniques such as MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were helpful in distinguishing growing tumor from treatment effect and necrosis in some patients. The median time to progression (TTP) was 5 months (range 2-11 months) and the median time to death (TTD) was 9 months (range 5-17 months). In this small patient sample adding thalidomide to radiation did not improve TTP or TTD from historical controls, however, toxicity appeared to be increased. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

AB  - Purpose: A key problem of using EPI for BOLD fMRI is the field inhomogeneities near air/tissue interfaces, or the susceptibility artifact. Therefore, fMRI studies in brain areas such as orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and temporal lobes (TL) may suffer from signal dropouts and spatial distortions. This study aimed to determine the optimal EPI slice angle, slice thickness and phase‐encoding (PE) direction for the reduction of BOLD sensitivity (BS) losses in TL and OFC. Methods: The study was performed on five healthy volunteers using a 1.5‐T MRI scanner. A single‐shot GE EPI sequence was applied with TR/TE/FA = 3000ms/60ms/900, FOV = 220mm and matrix = 64. The slice tilt was set from −45° to +30° (in 6 steps of 15°) relative to the AC‐PC direction, 35 or 24 slices for the slice thickness of 3 or 6 mm, respectively, and the PE direction either left‐right or anterior‐posterior, which resulted in 24 parameter combinations. BS maps were calculated with corresponding phase maps for each combination and normalized to a brain template using SPM2 for comparison. Results: Significant BS gain (&gt;15%) were observed in several parameter combinations, when comparing to the baseline BS (no slice tilt, slice thickness= 6mm, PE= anterior‐posterior). The optimal parameters that introduced most voxels with such BS gain were +30° slice tile, slice thickness= 3mm and PE = anterior‐posterior in the OFC, and −45° slice tile, slice thickness= 6mm and PE = left‐right in the TL. Conclusion: For the purpose of reducing BS losses in OFC and TL, this study provided the optimal EPI parameters that can be easily adopted in a clinical 1.5T MR scanner. For the PE direction, however, it is better to be kept in the anterior‐posterior direction to avoid peripheral nerve stimulation. Similar studies at 3T are currently under investigation. © 2007, American Association of Physicists in Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measurements of T2 relaxation times in tissues have provided a unique, noninvasive method to investigate the microenvironment of water molecules in vivo. As more clinical imaging is performed at higher field strengths, tissue relaxation times need to be reassessed in order to optimize tissue contrast. The purpose of this study was to investigate the water proton T2 relaxation time in human median nerve at 7 T. High-resolution images of the wrist were obtained using a home-built dedicated microstrip coil. Gradient echo images provided a good anatomical delineation of the wrist structure, with a clear definition of the median nerve, tendons, bone, and connective tissue within the wrist in an acquisition time of 2 min. Measurements of the T2 relaxation time were performed with a spin echo imaging sequence. The T2 relaxation time of the median nerve was 18.3 ± 1.9 ms, which is significantly shorter than the T2 measured in previous studies performed at 1.5 T and 3 T. Further, the T2 relaxation time of the median nerve is shorter than the T2 relaxation time of other tissues, such as brain tissue, at the same field strength. Since the T2 relaxation time of water protons is sensitive to the water microenvironment, relaxation measurements and, in general, a more quantitative magnetic resonance imaging approach might help in detecting and investigating diseases of peripheral nervous system, such as compressive and inflammatory neuropathies, in humans. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Important new information regarding neurologic complications of HIV disease was presented at the 2007 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. In addition to presentations on pathogenesis and treatment of neurologic complications, the conference included findings that have implications for the management of HIV disease outside the nervous system. Key findings included that the distribution of antiretrovirals into the central nervous system may influence the effectiveness of treatment outside this protected compartment; that postponing initiation of therapy until blood CD4+ counts fall to 300 cells/mm3 may increase the risk for HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment but interruption of antiretroviral therapy in individuals with high CD4+ counts may have neuropsychologic benefits; that substantial changes, including macrophage activation and neuronal injury can occur shortly after HIV transmission; that HIV can influence neural progenitor cells to decrease neuronal differentiation; that newer neuroimaging technologies, such as diffusion tensor imaging and blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging can identify important effects of HIV on the brain such as alterations in cerebral oxygen consumption; that serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors may reduce HIV RNA levels in cerebral spinal fluid; and that erythropoietin and the non-immunosuppressive immunophilin ligand, GPI-1046, may improve HIV-associated injury of peripheral nerves. The conference also included an important focus on JC virus encephalitis (also known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy).

AB  - Although the diffusivity and anisotropy of water has been investigated thoroughly in ordered axonal systems (i.e., nervous tissue), there have been very few studies on the directional dependence of diffusion of metabolites. In this study, the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (Trace/3 ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the intracellular metabolites N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (tCr), choline (Cho), taurine (Tau), and glutamate and glutamine (Glx) were measured parallel and perpendicular to the length of excised frog sciatic nerve using a water suppressed, diffusion-weighted, spin-echo pulse sequence at 18.8 T. The degree of anisotropy (FA) of NAA (0.41 ± 0.09) was determined to be less than tCr (0.59 ± 0.07) and Cho (0.61 ± 0.11), which is consistent with previously reported human studies of white matter. In contrast, Glx diffusion was found to be almost isotropic with an FA value of 0.20 ± 0.06. The differences of FA between the metabolites is most likely due to their differing micro-environments and could be beneficial as an indicator of compartment specific changes with disease, information not readily available with water diffusion. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Object. The operative management of combined intrapelvic and extrapelvic sciatic notch dumbbell-shaped tumors is challenging. The relatively rare occurrence of these tumors and the varied extent of disease have made it difficult for surgeons to establish definitive surgical indications or predict favorable neurological outcomes based on preoperative imaging data. Methods. In the past 3 years, the authors treated five patients presenting with radiating leg pain as a result of benign sciatic notch dumbbell-shaped tumors. These tumors in three patients with unilateral leg symptoms were considered unresectable by other neurosurgeons because of presumed direct intrinsic neural involvement. After high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated that the extensive tumors were separate from the sciatic nerve and the lumbosacral plexus, however, these patients underwent a combined one-stage transabdominal and posterior transgluteal complete resection. Normal neurological status was maintained postoperatively in these three patients, and after more than 1 year of postoperative follow up, there were no tumor recurrences. In two patients with bilateral symptoms and extensive tumor burden, serial MR images showed that innumerable tumors directly involved the entire cross-sectional area of the sciatic nerves and extended longitudinally to the lumbosacral plexuses. Tumor debulking or resection in these patients would have resulted in neurological deficits and would not have addressed their neuropathic pain, and therefore no surgery was performed. These two patients were treated pharmacologically and advised to monitor their tumor status over the course of their lifetimes in case of malignant transformation of the tumor. Conclusions. A combined one-stage transabdominal and transgluteal approach allows safe resection of selected benign but extensive sciatic notch tumors. High-resolution MR imaging is a useful tool in the management of these tumors because it allows the surgeon to visualize the anatomical relationships of the tumor to the sciatic nerve. The authors believe that as this imaging technology advances, it will provide surgeons with a method to predict definitively which sciatic notch tumors displace rather than directly involve the sciatic nerve, and therefore indicate which tumors can be resected safely and completely.

AB  - One serious complication of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the development of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs). These malignancies often develop within pre-existing plexiform neurofibromas and their development is now thought to be associated with both tumour suppressor gene mutations and dysregulated growth factor signalling. Recent work demonstrates that the lifetime risk of malignant transformation is significantly greater than previously thought. Ionising radiation, a long-standing disease, particularly the presence of a large number of plexiform neurofibromas from an early age, are suggested risk factors. We present an NF1 patient who developed an MPNST of the cervical vagus nerve which was successfully treated with surgery. Close monitoring of patients with NF and a high level of suspicion towards rapidly enlarging and painful swellings is merited as these features may signify malignant transformation. Whether a positive history of MPNST in other affected family members predisposes the individual to a higher risk of malignant transformation is unclear. © 2006 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis: In addition to nephropathy, retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy, a microvascular complication of type 1 diabetes that may be tentatively referred to as 'diabetic encephalopathy' has gained increasing attention. There is growing evidence that lowered cognitive performance in patients with type 1 diabetes is related to chronic hyperglycaemia rather than recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, as previously speculated. The aim of our study was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to establish whether long-term hyperglycaemia, resulting in advanced retinopathy, contributes to structural changes in the brain (reduced grey matter). Subjects, materials and methods: We applied voxel-based morphometry on magnetic resonance images to compare grey matter density (GMD) between three groups of participants. GMD is used as a marker of cortical atrophy. We compared 13 type 1 diabetic patients with a microvascular complication (i.e. proliferative retinopathy) with 18 type 1 diabetic patients who did not have retinopathy in order to assess the effects of microvascular changes on GMD. Both patient groups were compared with 21 healthy control subjects to assess the effect of diabetes in itself. Results: Patients with diabetic retinopathy showed reduced GMD in the right inferior frontal gyrus and right occipital lobe compared both with patients without retinopathy and with healthy controls (p<0.05). Conclusions/interpretation: Our data show that patients with type 1 diabetes, who, as a consequence of chronic hyperglycaemia, had developed advanced retinopathy, also showed increased focal cortical atrophy on brain MRI. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

AB  - Background: Cranial neuropathy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is relatively rare compared to the frequently reported peripheral neuropathy. Methods: We investigated the occurrence of subclinical cranial and peripheral nerve involvement in 55 patients with RA. Results: Patients had a mean age of 43.1 years and a mean duration of illness of 6.4 years. All patients presented with electrophysiological findings suggestive of peripheral neuropathy. In addition, 69.1% of them had entrapment neuropathies, in which carpal tunnel syndrome was the most common (54.6%). Sensorimotor neuropathy at sites other than usual entrapment sites was diagnosed in 70.9%, while bilateral distal sensory neuropathy in lower limbs was identified in 29.1%. Among cranial nerves examined, optic and vestibulocochlear neuropathies were common (29.1% of eyes and 40% of ears examined). Spinal accessory neuropathy was reported in 21.8% of records. Neither facial nor trigeminal nerves were affected. Electrophysiological characteristics of neuropathies were indicative of axon loss. Significant association was identified between neuropathy and patients'ages (P < 0.01), duration of the illness (P < 0.001), presence of rheumatoid nodules (P < 0.001) and disease stages (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results indicate that cranial and non-compressive neuropathies are not uncommon in RA. This extends the pathologic disease spectrum. We do not confirm, but suggest the contribution of chronic immune-mediated vasculitis and/or neurotoxicity in RA neuropathies. Of clinical importance, subclinical neuropathy may never progress and/or be of clinical significance, which contradicts that of comparable diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Advances in genetics implicate a complex immune genetics which controls susceptibilities and adaptive molecular mechanisms as a culprit of phenotypical heterogenicity among related diseases. © 2006 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology.

AB  - 1. Foot infections in patients with diabetes cause substantial morbidity and frequent visits to health care professionals and may lead to amputation of a lower extremity. 2. Diabetic foot infections require attention to local (foot) and systemic (metabolic) issues and coordinated management, preferably by a multidisciplinary foot-care team (A-II) (). The team managing these infections should include, or have ready access to, an infectious diseases specialist or a medical microbiologist (B-II). 3. The major predisposing factor to these infections is foot ulceration, which is usually related to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral vascular disease and various immunological disturbances play a secondary role. 4. Aerobic Gram-positive cocci (especially Staphylococcus aureus) are the predominant pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have chronic wounds or who have recently received antibiotic therapy may also be infected with Gram-negative rods, and those with foot ischemia or gangrene may have obligate anaerobic pathogens. 5. Wound infections must be diagnosed clinically on the basis of local (and occasionally systemic) signs and symptoms of inflammation. Laboratory (including microbiological) investigations are of limited use for diagnosing infection, except in cases of osteomyelitis (B-II). 6. Send appropriately obtained specimens for culture before starting empirical antibiotic therapy in all cases of infection, except perhaps those that are mild and previously untreated (B-III). Tissue specimens obtained by biopsy, ulcer curettage, or aspiration are preferable to wound swab specimens (A-I). 7. Imaging studies may help diagnose or better define deep, soft-tissue purulent collections and are usually needed to detect pathological findings in bone. Plain radiography may be adequate in many cases, but MRI (in preference to isotope scanning) is more sensitive and specific, especially for detection of soft-tissue lesions (A-I). 8. Infections should be categorized by their severity on the basis of readily assessable clinical and laboratory features (B-II). Most important among these are the specific tissues involved, the adequacy of arterial perfusion, and the presence of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability. Categorization helps determine the degree of risk to the patient and the limb and, thus, the urgency and venue of management. 9. Available evidence does not support treating clinically uninfected ulcers with antibiotic therapy (D-III). Antibiotic therapy is necessary for virtually all infected wounds, but it is often insufficient without appropriate wound care. 10. Select an empirical antibiotic regimen on the basis of the severity of the infection and the likely etiologic agent(s) (B-II). Therapy aimed solely at aerobic Gram-positive cocci may be sufficient for mild-to-moderate infections in patients who have not recently received antibiotic therapy (A-II). Broad-spectrum empirical therapy is not routinely required but is indicated for severe infections, pending culture results and antibiotic susceptibility data (B-III). Take into consideration any recent antibiotic therapy and local antibiotic susceptibility data, especially the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms. Definitive therapy should be based on both the culture results and susceptibility data and the clinical response to the empirical regimen (C-III). 11. There is only limited evidence with which to make informed choices among the various topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotic agents. Virtually all severe and some moderate infections require parenteral therapy, at least initially (C-III). Highly bioavailable oral antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections, including some cases of osteomyelitis (A-II). Topical therapy may be used for some mild superficial infections (B-I). 12. Continue antibiotic therapy until there is evidence that the infection has resolved but not necessarily until a wound has healed. Suggestions for the duration of antibiotic therapy are as follows: for mild infections, 12 weeks usually suffices, but some require an additional 12 weeks; for moderate and severe infections, usually 24 weeks is sufficient, depending on the structures involved, the adequacy of debridement, the type of soft-tissue wound cover, and wound vascularity (A-II); and for osteomyelitis, generally at least 46 weeks is required, but a shorter duration is sufficient if the entire infected bone is removed, and probably a longer duration is needed if infected bone remains (B-II). 13. If an infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to 1 antibiotic courses, consider discontinuing all antimicrobials and, after a few days, obtaining optimal culture specimens (C-III). 14. Seek surgical consultation and, when needed, intervention for infections accompanied by a deep abscess, extensive bone or joint involvement, crepitus, substantial necrosis or gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis (A-II). Evaluating the limb's arterial supply and revascularizing when indicated are particularly important. Surgeons with experience and interest in the field should be recruited by the foot-care team, if possible. 15. Providing optimal wound care, in addition to appropriate antibiotic treatment of the infection, is crucial for healing (A-I). This includes proper wound cleansing, debridement of any callus and necrotic tissue, and, especially, off-loading of pressure. There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific wound dressing or any type of wound healing agents or products for infected foot wounds. 16. Patients with infected wounds require early and careful follow-up observation to ensure that the selected medical and surgical treatment regimens have been appropriate and effective (B-III). 17. Studies have not adequately defined the role of most adjunctive therapies for diabetic foot infections, but systematic reviews suggest that granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help prevent amputations (B-I). These treatments may be useful for severe infections or for those that have not adequately responded to therapy, despite correcting for all amenable local and systemic adverse factors. 18. Spread of infection to bone (osteitis or osteomyelitis) may be difficult to distinguish from noninfectious osteoarthropathy. Clinical examination and imaging tests may suffice, but bone biopsy is valuable for establishing the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, for defining the pathogenic organism(s), and for determining the antibiotic susceptibilities of such organisms (B-II). 19. Although this field has matured, further research is much needed. The committee especially recommends that adequately powered prospective studies be undertaken to elucidate and validate systems for classifying infection, diagnosing osteomyelitis, defining optimal antibiotic regimens in various situations, and clarifying the role of surgery in treating osteomyelitis (A-III).

AB  - Purpose: To report a technique developed for visualizing cervical nerve roots and distal nerve fibers using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging employing parallel imaging. Material and Methods: We performed maximum intensity projection for a stack of isotropic axial diffusion-weighted images obtained with parallel imaging applying a motion-probing gradient in six directions with a b -value of 500s/mm 2 in a preliminary series of 13 subjects. Results: This method worked well for visualizing the spinal cord and most of the nerve roots, the dorsal root ganglia, and proximal peripheral nerves. Conclusion: Although the technique remains limited in depicting the brachial plexus and distal nerves, the ability to visualize the proximal peripheral nervous system at the cervical level is promising. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The in vivo assessment of axonal projections of the peripheral nervous system has been severely limited by the lack of noninvasive techniques. We examined whether MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking of the human median nerve is feasible. The median nerve was examined with a 3-T MRI scanner in wrists of three healthy volunteers and the wrist of a patient after median nerve repair. In vivo three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of axonal projections of the median nerve could be achieved in healthy volunteers with intact median nerves and a patient with a transected median nerve using diffusion tensor imaging combined with fiber tracking. The median nerve could be visualized and correlated well to the expected location on T1-weighted images in the patient and all volunteers. The transected median nerve in the patient could be detected up to the site of repair one month postoperatively, whereas the nerve could not be detected more distally immediately after repair. Two months postoperatively, it could clearly be tracked more distally, indicating nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging can detect the median nerve in healthy individuals as well as up to the lesion site in a patient with a complete transection of the median nerve. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The epilepsies are one of the most common serious brain disorders, can occur at all ages, and have many possible presentations and causes. Although incidence in childhood has fallen over the past three decades in developed countries, this reduction is matched by an increase in elderly people. Monogenic Mendelian epilepsies are rare. A clinical syndrome often has multiple possible genetic causes, and conversely, different mutations in one gene can lead to various epileptic syndromes. Most common epilepsies, however, are probably complex traits with environmental effects acting on inherited susceptibility, mediated by common variation in particular genes. Diagnosis of epilepsy remains clinical, and neurophysiological investigations assist with diagnosis of the syndrome. Brain imaging is making great progress in identifying the structural and functional causes and consequences of the epilepsies. Current antiepileptic drugs suppress seizures without influencing the underlying tendency to generate seizures, and are effective in 60-70% of individuals. Pharmacogenetic studies hold the promise of being able to better individualise treatment for each patient, with maximum possibility of benefit and minimum risk of adverse effects. For people with refractory focal epilepsy, neurosurgical resection offers the possibility of a life-changing cure. Potential new treatments include precise prediction of seizures and focal therapy with drug delivery, neural stimulation, and biological grafts. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is poorly understood. We have recently reported a significant reduction in spinal cord cross-sectional area at the stage of clinically detectable DPN. In this study, we investigated whether spinal cord atrophy occurs in early (subclinical) DPN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Eighty-one male type 1 diabetic subjects, 24 nondiabetic control subjects, and 8 subjects with hereditary sensory motor neuropathy (HSMN) type 1A underwent detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments. Diabetic subjects were subsequently divided into three groups based on neuropathy severity (19 with no DPN, 23 with subclinical DPN, and 39 with clinically detectable DPN). All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and cord area measurements at disc level C2/C3. RESULTS - Mean corrected spinal cord area index (SCAI) (corrected for age, height, and weight) was 67.5 mm [95% CI 64.1-70.9] in diabetic subjects without DPN. Those with subclinical (62.4mm[59.5- 65.3]) and clinically detectable DPN (57.2mm[54.9 -59.6]) had lower mean SCAIs compared with subjects with no DPN (P = 0.03 and P < 0.001, respectively). No significant difference was found between diabetic subjects without DPN and nondiabetic control subjects (69.2 mm [66.3-72.0], P = 0.47). Mean SCAIs in subjects with HSMN type 1A (71.07 mm[65.3-76.9]) were not significantly different from those for nondiabetic control subjects and diabetic subjects without DPN. Among diabetic subjects, SCAI was significantly related to sural sensory conduction velocities and the Neuropathy Composite and Symptom Scores. CONCLUSIONS - Spinal cord involvement occurs early in DPN. There is also a significant relation between reduction in SCAI and neurophysiological assessments of DPN. © 2006 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) is common. Around 8000 cases occur per year in Australia, of which 60% are hospital- or healthcare-associated. Risk factors for SAB include injectable drug use, haemodialysis, indwelling vascular catheters and immunosuppression. Metastatic infection develops in up to one-third of patients with SAB, with joints and heart valves being the most commonly affected sites. Community-acquisition, persistent fever, positive blood cultures after 48 h of treatment and the presence of embolic lesions correlate with the presence of complicated SAB (i.e. high risk of endocarditis and/or other metastatic complications). All patients require careful clinical evaluation to exclude endocarditis and other metastatic foci. Echocardiography, preferably transoesophageal echocardiography, should be performed to exclude endocarditis. Most patients with SAB, and all with features of complicated SAB, require prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy (at least 4 weeks), but a subgroup with good prognostic features may be suitable for shorter intravenous therapy (2 weeks). Penicillinase-resistant penicillins (e.g. flucloxacillin) are the agents of choice for SAB with methicillin-sensitive strains. Vancomycin or first-generation cephalosporins are alternatives but have lower antimicrobial activity than flucloxacillin. However, vancomycin remains the therapy of choice for SAB due to methicillin-resistant strains. Combination therapy with gentamicin may be useful for the first few days of treatment in selected patients, but otherwise there are few data to support the use of combination regimens in SAB. Newer agents such as linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin may have a role in selected patients, especially in SAB due to S. aureus strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin.

AB  - "Pure" adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is the noninflammatory myeloneuropathic variant of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, where the disease process appears to be restricted to spinal cord tracts and peripheral nerves. The absence of obvious brain involvement makes it distinct from the inflammatory cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. However, some pure AMN patients later experience development of cerebral demyelination, but little is known about die extent of brain involvement in pure AMN patients who have normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. We used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate possible occult cerebral abnormalities in such pure AMN patients. Fractional anisotropy and trace were studied in three-dimensional reconstructions of white matter tracts commonly involved in cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Results demonstrated reduced fractional anisotropy and increased trace in bilateral corticospinal tracts and genu of corpus callosum (p < 0.05). Diffusion tensor imaging-based three-dimensional fiber tracking showed occult tract-specific cerebral microstructural abnormalities in pure AMN patients who had a normal conventional brain magnetic resonance image. Corticospinal tract abnormalities could reflect a centripetal extension of spinal cord long-tract distal axonopathy. Accompanying abnormalities in genu of corpus callosum indicate that the disease pathology in pure AMN may not be limited to spinal cord long tracts alone, although the involvement of the latter is most prominent and severe. © 2005 American Neurological Association.

AB  - Somatosensory stimulation (SS), leading to increases in motor cortical excitability, influences motor performance in patients with brain lesions like stroke. The mechanisms by which SS modulates motor function are incompletely understood. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD), and perfusion imagings simultaneously acquired in a 3 T magnet) to assess the effects of SS on thumb-movement-related activation in three regions of interest (ROI) in the motor network: primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in healthy volunteers. Scans were obtained in different sessions before and after 2-h electrical stimulation applied to the median nerve at the wrist (MNS), to the skin overlying the shoulder deltoid muscle (DMS), and in the absence of stimulation (NOSTIM) in a counterbalanced design. We found that baseline perfusion intensity was comparable within and across sessions. MNS but not DMS nor NOSTIM led to an increase in signal intensity and number of voxels activated by performance of median nerve-innervated thumb movements in M1, S1, and PMd for up to 60 min. Task-related fMRI activation changes were most prominent in M1 followed by S1 and to a lesser extent in PMd. MNS elicited a displacement of the center of gravity for the thumb movement representation towards the other finger representations within S1. These results indicate that MNS leads to an expansion of the thumb representation towards other finger representations within S1, a form of plasticity that may underlie the influence of SS on motor cortical function, possibly supporting beneficial effects on motor control.

AB  - Objective: We studied whether distal peripheral nerves could be imaged using quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a 3-T MRI scanner, and visualized using tractography. Methods: Altogether 6 healthy subjects were studied. The diffusion was quantified with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and the direction of main diffusivity was visualized with color-coded orientation maps and tractography. Results: We present the first DTI and tractography results of human distal peripheral nerves. The courses of median, ulnar, and radial nerves in the upper limb and of tibial and peroneal nerves in the lower limb were first analyzed quantifying ADC and FA, and then visualized in 3D with tractography. Tractography illustrated nicely the 3D courses of both upper and lower limb nerves which were reliably distinguished from the surrounding muscle tissue and ligaments. Conclusions: Quantitative DTI and tractography can be used to image and visualize distal peripheral nerves. Significance: DTI is a quantitative method that could provide useful information for the diagnosis and follow-up of nerve lesions, entrapments, and regeneration. Peripheral nerves as well-delineated structures also containing abundant branching into bundles of different diameters, could be used as 'living phantoms' for testing and validating different tractography methods. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - The trigeminal nerve and nuclei (the trigeminal complex) are unique in the human body with regard to their anatomical and physiological characteristics. They are also special regarding the lesions in which they are involved, both at the peripheral level because of the susceptibility of some terminal branches, and at the nuclei because of their large size and the large amount of connections with other centers. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging studies are often not sufficiently informative to demonstrate very tiny lesions that could be responsible for an important damage in the brainstem. Therefore, clinical neurophysiology and specifically, the techniques used in the study of the trigeminal functions, remain as convenient diagnostic and research tools to document clinically evident lesions or uncover subclinical abnormalities. This review is focussed on the clinical applicability of the study of trigeminal reflexes, including methods employed in the documentation of focal lesions of peripheral branches, trigeminal involvement of peripheral neuropathies, specific lesions of the trigeminal ganglia, central nervous dysfunctions causing abnormalities in the excitability of trigeminal neurons, and the possible use of trigeminal nerve reflexes in the study of facial pain syndromes and headache. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB  - Neuromyelitis optica is a clinical syndrome characterised by acute transverse myelitis plus an acute or subacute optic neuritis with or without recovery. Although once believed to be a variant of multiple sclerosis, diagnostic criteria have recently been proposed for neuromyelitis optica, making it a clinically distinct syndrome. The term gluten sensitivity refers to a state of heightened immunological responsiveness to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, as indicated by circulating antibodies to gliadin. Several neurological complications have been described associated with gluten sensitivity ranging from peripheral neuropathy and cerebellar ataxia to an increased risk of epilepsy. Although myelopathy has been described in some case reports of coeliac disease, neuromyelitis optica has never been described in association with gluten sensitivity. We describe two cases of gluten sensitivity presenting as neuromyelitis optica with no previous history of significant gastrointestinal symptoms. Gluten sensitivity was confirmed by immunological and histological studies.

AB  - Purpose: To examine the possibility of performing high-resolution MRI (microneurography) on peripheral nerves. Materials and Methods: A specific radio frequency (RF) coil was developed to probe the human median nerve at a magnetic field strength of 9.4 T and tested on three excised samples by acquiring microneurograms. Results: The microneurograms revealed neuronal tissue constituents at subfascicular level. The contrast features on proton-density and T1- and T2-weighted images were described and compared. The microscopic water movement was quantified using diffusion weighting parallel and orthogonal to the neuronal fiber orientation. The characteristics of anisotropic diffusion in the median nerve were comparable to those reported from other biological tissues (white matter and kidney). Conclusion: The results overall suggest that microneurography might provide new noninvasive insights into microscopic gross anatomy of the peripheral nerve, injury evaluation, and efficacy of repair, although the feasibility at current clinically relevant field strengths is yet to be determined. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - To characterize structural changes and the metabolic profile of foot muscles and correlate them with diabetic neuropathy measurements using phosphorus-31 (31P) rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We studied 12 control subjects, 9 nonneuropathic diabetic patients, and 12 neuropathic diabetic patients using 31P RARE and proton ( 1H) MRI at 3 Tesla. The ratio of the total cross-sectional area of the foot to that of the muscle tissue was calculated from transaxial 1H and 31P images. The average 31P concentration across the metatarsal head region was measured from the 31P images. RESULTS - The muscle area-to-total area ratio differed among all three groups (means ± SD): 0.55 ± 0.04 vs. 0.44 ± 0.05 vs. 0.06 ± 0.06 for control, nonneuropathic, and neuropathic subjects, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001). The average 31P concentration also differed among all groups: 27.7 ± 3.8 vs. 21.7 ± 4.8 vs. 7.9 ± 8.8 mmol/l for control, nonneuropathic, and neuropathic subjects (P &lt; 0.0001). The muscle area-to-total area ratio strongly correlated with clinical measurements: Neuropathy Disability Score, r = -0.83, P &lt; 0.0001; vibration perception threshold, r = -0.79, P &lt; 0.0001; and Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, r = -0.87, P &lt; 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS - Small muscle atrophy is present in diabetes before clinical peripheral neuropathy can be detected using standard clinical techniques. The 31P RARE MRI method evaluates the severity of muscle atrophy, even in the early stages when neuropathy is absent. This technique may prove to be a useful diagnostic tool in identifying early-stage diabetic foot problems. © 2005 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Furious rabies is a well-recognized clinical disorder in humans but the paralytic form is not as easily identified. The mechanisms responsible for the weakness and longer survival periods are not clear. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including rabies virus variants associated with a particular vector, location of wounds, incubation period, influence of prior rabies vaccination, and virus localization in the central nervous system (CNS). However, none of these have been substantiated. Regarding molecular analyses of rabies viruses isolated from both furious and paralytic rabies patients, only minor genetic variations with no specific patterns in glyco- (G), phospho- (P), and nucleoprotein (N) sequences have been identified and arginine 333 in G protein was present in all samples. Regional distribution of rabies virus antigen in rabies patients whose survival periods were 7 days or less and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the CNS indicated brainstem and spinal cord as predilection sites regardless of clinical presentations. There are clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological indications that peripheral nerve dysfunction is responsible for weakness in paralytic rabies whereas in furious rabies, even in the absence of clinical weakness, abundant denervation potentials with normal sensory nerve conduction studies and proximal motor latencies suggest anterior horn cell dysfunction. The lack of cellular immunity to rabies virus antigen accompanied by an absence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rabies neutralizing antibody in most paralytic rabies patients may argue against role of an immune response against rabies virus-positive axons. Aberrant immune responses to peripheral nerve antigen, in particular those mediated by one or more cellular-dependent mechanisms, may be involved as is supported by the absence of putative anti-ganglioside antibodies commonly found in immune-mediated peripheral nerve diseases. Longer survival period in paralytic rabies may possibly be related to currently unidentified mechanism(s) on neuronal gene expression, required for virus transcription/replication and for maintaining neuronal survival. © 2005 Journal of NeuroVirology.

AB  - In vivo diffusion tensor data obtained with diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) can be used to estimate fibre tract trajectories in white matter in the brain. Such data can, for example, be used to visualize and study the connectivity and continuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This paper discusses a toy model which is used to assess limitations on the reliability of computed trajectories imposed by MRI noise. The analysis is based on a two-dimensional random walk model for which a very good approximate solution is available. The suggested theoretical approach to analyse this model is shown to be in excellent agreement with simulations. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

AB  - The role of the brain in chronic pain conditions remains speculative. We compared brain morphology of 26 chronic back pain (CBP) patients to matched control subjects, using magnetic resonance imaging brain scan data and automated analysis techniques. CBP patients were divided into neuropathic, exhibiting pain because of sciatic nerve damage, and non-neuropathic groups. Pain-related characteristics were correlated to morphometric measures. Neocortical gray matter volume was compared after skull normalization. Patients with CBP showed 5-11% less neocortical gray matter volume than control subjects. The magnitude of this decrease is equivalent to the gray matter volume lost in 10-20 years of normal aging. The decreased volume was related to pain duration, indicating a 1.3 cm3 loss of gray matter for every year of chronic pain. Regional gray matter density in 17 CBP patients was compared with matched controls using voxel-based morphometry and nonparametric statistics. Gray matter density was reduced in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right thalamus and was strongly related to pain characteristics in a pattern distinct for neuropathic and non-neuropathic CBP. Our results imply that CBP is accompanied by brain atrophy and suggest that the pathophysiology of chronic pain includes thalamocortical processes.

AB  - Purpose of review: Clinical investigations of peripheral nerve lesions routinely involve nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Imaging studies are often used to exclude focal mass lesions or external compression and to visualize muscle atrophy. More recently, it has been recognized that magnetic resonance imaging can identify changes in peripheral nerves and secondary neurogenic alterations in skeletal muscle, which may significantly enhance its use in the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. Recent findings: Acute axonal nerve lesions cause a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images at and distal to the lesion site, which correlates with Wallerian degeneration and nerve oedema. Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles provide an exciting new tool to detect the invasion of macrophages into the degenerating nerve distal to an axonal lesion. Prolongation of the T2 relaxation time and gadolinium enhancement of denervated muscle develop in parallel to the development of spontaneous activity on electromyography, and are probably the consequence of capillary enlargement and increased muscular blood volume. Summary: Magnetic resonance imaging supplements the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. An advantage over clinical neurophysiological investigations is that it is operator independent and painless. It can identify axonal damage and may thus help to identify a lesion site precisely, where fractionated nerve conduction studies are not applicable. Novel contrast media may potentially be used to detect pathophysiologically relevant mechanisms such as infiltration of the nerve by macrophages. Magnetic resonance imaging also has the advantage of providing a lasting detailed topographical picture of regional variations and avoids localization errors of muscles in electromyography. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Foot infections in patients with diabetes cause substantial morbidity and frequent visits to health care professionals and may lead to amputation of a lower extremity. Diabetic foot infections require attention to local (foot) and systemic (metabolic) issues and coordinated management, preferably by a multidisciplinary foot-care team (A-II) (table 1). The team managing these infections should include, or have ready access to, an infectious diseases specialist or a medical microbiologist (B-II). The major predisposing factor to these infections is foot ulceration, which is usually related to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral vascular disease and various immunological disturbances play a secondary role. Aerobic gram-positive cocci (especially Staphylococcus aureus) are the predominant pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have chronic wounds or who have recently received antibiotic therapy may also be infected with gram-negative rods, and those with foot ischemia or gangrene may have obligate anaerobic pathogens. Wound infections must be diagnosed clinically on the basis of local (and occasionally systemic) signs and symptoms of inflammation. Laboratory (including microbiological) investigations are of limited use for diagnosing infection, except in cases of osteomyelitis (B-II). Send appropriately obtained specimens for culture prior to starting empirical antibiotic therapy in all cases of infection, except perhaps those that are mild and previously untreated (B-III). Tissue specimens obtained by biopsy, ulcer curettage, or aspiration are preferable to wound swab specimens (A-I). Imaging studies may help diagnose or better define deep, soft-tissue purulent collections and are usually needed to detect pathological findings in bone. Plain radiography may be adequate in many cases, but MRI (in preference to isotope scanning) is more sensitive and specific, especially for detection of soft-tissue lesions (A-I). Infections should be categorized by their severity on the basis of readily assessable clinical and laboratory features (B-II). Most important among these are the specific tissues involved, the adequacy of arterial perfusion, and the presence of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability. Categorization helps determine the degree of risk to the patient and the limb and, thus, the urgency and venue of management. Available evidence does not support treating clinically uninfected ulcers with antibiotic therapy (D-III). Antibiotic therapy is necessary for virtually all infected wounds, but it is often insufficient without appropriate wound care. Select an empirical antibiotic regimen on the basis of the severity of the infection and the likely etiologic agent(s) (B-II). Therapy aimed solely at aerobic gram-positive cocci may be sufficient for mild-to-moderate infections in patients who have not recently received antibiotic therapy (A-II). Broad-spectrum empirical therapy is not routinely required but is indicated for severe infections, pending culture results and antibiotic susceptibility data (B-III). Take into consideration any recent antibiotic therapy and local antibiotic susceptibility data, especially the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms. Definitive therapy should be based on both the culture results and susceptibility data and the clinical response to the empirical regimen (C-III). There is only limited evidence with which to make informed choices among the various topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotic agents. Virtually all severe and some moderate infections require parenteral therapy, at least initially (C-III). Highly bioavailable oral antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections, including some cases of osteomyelitis (A-II). Topical therapy may be used for some mild superficial infections (B-I). Continue antibiotic therapy until there is evidence that the infection has resolved but not necessarily until a wound has healed. Suggestions for the duration of antibiotic therapy are as follows: for mild infections, 1-2 weeks usually suffices, but some require an additional 1-2 weeks; for moderate and severe infections, usually 2-4 weeks is sufficient, depending on the structures involved, the adequacy of debridement, the type of soft-tissue wound cover, and wound vascularity (A-II); and for osteomyelitis, generally at least 4-6 weeks is required, but a shorter duration is sufficient if the entire infected bone is removed, and probably a longer duration is needed if infected bone remains (B-II). If an infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to ≥1 antibiotic courses, consider discontinuing an antimicrobials and, after a few days, obtaining optimal culture specimens (C-III). Seek surgical consultation and, when needed, intervention for infections accompanied by a deep abscess, extensive bone or joint involvement, crepitus, substantial necrosis or gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis (A-II). Evaluating the limb's arterial supply and revascularizing when indicated are particularly important. Surgeons with experience and interest in the field should be recruited by the foot-care team, if possible. Providing optimal wound care, in addition to appropriate antibiotic treatment of the infection, is crucial for healing (A-I). This includes proper wound cleansing, debridement of any callus and necrotic tissue, and, especially, off-loading of pressure. There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific wound dressing or any type of wound healing agents or products for infected foot wounds.

AB  - We examined if MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking could be performed on the sciatic nerve. In 3 healthy volunteers the proximal thigh was examined on a 1.5-Tesla MR-scanner with a 2-channel phased-array coil. Though inherently susceptible to motion, field inhomogeneities, and fast T 2-relaxation of the diffusion imaging technique, the sciatic nerve could be detected and correlated to T2-weighted images in all 3 subjects. Further investigations need to be done to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to see if smaller peripheral nerves than the sciatic nerve can be detected. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - High-resolution MR imaging of peripheral nerves and nerve plexuses is an area of rapidly growing clinical interest and importance. The number of studies performed is rapidly increasing in response to the need for more detailed in vivo information about neuropathic changes and regional neural anatomy before treatment planning by peripheral nerve specialists [84]. Specific information gained from peripheral nerve-imaging studies is being used to determine the need for biopsy or surgical treatment. In patients who have small tumors, peripheral nerve imaging has proved useful in planning the surgical approach and in predicting the prognosis for preservation of nerve function postoperatively. In cases of traumatic nerve injury, MR imaging results are being considered as part of the clinical assessment regarding (1) the likelihood of spontaneous recovery versus the need for surgical repair and (2) the progression of nerve recovery postoperatively. Additional applications and new developments for the MR techniques used in peripheral nerve imaging are on the horizon. Among these are improvements in the homogeneity of fat saturation methods and alternative approaches to removing fat signal, such as multipoint Dixon fat-water separation with SSFP or FSE imaging methods. Rapid volumetric data acquisition with high CNR may allow the presentation of the largest peripheral nerves and their branches in a three-dimensional display, analogous to the three-dimensional maximum-intensity projection images of the vasculature available with MR angiography. This presentation will provide the referring physician with a more complete picture of the affected peripheral nerves, facilitating localization and diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Improvements in imaging of peripheral nerves coupled with the availability of MR-guided interventional systems should eventually lead to therapeutic interventions for peripheral neuropathy. Experimental studies using mice already have shown that the introduction of replication-defective viral vectors directly into dorsal root ganglia using microneurosurgical technique leads to long-term expression of reporter genes along the length of the sensory neuron, from its distal portion to the ipsilateral nucleus gracilis and cuneatus [85]. Dorsal root ganglia injection may be superior to other therapeutic approaches, such as intraneural injection into more distal peripheral nerve segments [86]. Targeted expression of foreign genes in the peripheral nervous system has several potentially valuable applications, including gene therapy of neuromuscular diseases, neuroanatomic studies, and the elucidation of mechanisms of axonal flow.

AB  - Spatial encoding in MR techniques is achieved by sampling the signal as a function of time in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. The gradients are assumed to generate a linear magnetic field gradient, and typical image reconstruction relies upon this approximation. However, high-speed gradients in the current generation of MRI scanners often sacrifice linearity for improvements in speed. Such nonlinearity results in distorted images. The problem is presented in terms of first principles, and a correction method based on a gradient field spherical harmonic expansion is proposed. In our case, the amount of distortion measured within a typical field of view (FOV) required for head imaging is sufficiently large that without the use of some distortion correction technique, the images would be of limited use for stereotaxy or longitudinal studies, where precise volumetric information is required. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives. It is widely accepted that peripheral nerve repairs performed within 6 weeks of injury have much better outcomes than those performed at later dates. However, there is no diagnostic technique that can determine if a traumatic peripheral nerve injury requires surgical intervention in the early postinjury phase. The objective of this article was to determine whether novel, noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging techniques could demonstrate the microstructure of human peripheral nerves that is necessary for determining prognosis and determining if surgery is indicated following traumatic injury. Methods. Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging protocols were developed on a 9.4-T research scanner using spin-echo proton density and gradient-echo imaging sequences and a specially designed, inductively coupled radio frequency coil. These imaging protocols were applied to in situ imaging of the human median nerve in 4 fresh-frozen cadaver arms. Results. Noninvasive high-resolution images of the human median nerve were obtained. Structures in the nerve that were observed included fascicles, interfascicular epineurium, perineurium, and intrafascicular septations. Conclusion. Application of these imaging techniques to clinical scanners could provide physicians with a tool that is capable of grading the severity of nerve injuries and providing indications for surgery in the early postinjury phase.

AB  - Background: Peripheral neuropathies in various locations are described as complications after anesthesia and surgery. This is the first case report of temporary bilateral occipital neuropathy from positioning for thyroid surgery in a morbidly obese patient. Methods: A 48-year-old women with a history of depression, fibro-myalgia, asthma, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity (127 kg, 165 cm) underwent 4 hours anesthesia with propofol/ remifentanil without muscle relaxation for thyroid surgery. The neck with a very low range of motion secondary to fat tissue needed to be extended to facilitate surgery as much as possible. The head was carefully padded and there were no episodes of hypotension or hypoxemia throughout the case or in the PACU. At post op day 1 she complained of bilateral numbness in the distribution area of both greater occipital nerves. On post op day 2 tingling sensations and improvement of numbness was noticed. The patient recovered without residual symptoms after 6 weeks. Conclusion: Pressure or shear stress to the nerve, hypoperfusion or metabolic disturbances are discussed as the leading etiology of nerve damage during surgery in the literature. Pressure from fat tissue during prolonged head extension for surgery seems to be the cause in this case and should therefore be avoided whenever possible in morbidly obese patients, especially when other risk factors for neuropathy like diabetes are present.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess whether MR imaging can image the neurovascular bundle in patients with fractures of the mandible. In addition, an attempt was made to evaluate whether MR images provide information regarding the continuity of the inferior alveolar nerve before surgery and regarding signal intensity changes after trauma. METHODS: We analyzed preoperative MR images of 23 patients with mandibular fractures. Object-oriented sagittal view proton density- and T1-weighted sequences (before and after the administration of contrast agent) were used not only in an attempt to obtain purely qualitative information regarding nerve continuity in the neurovascular bundle (inferior alveolar nerve, artery, vein) but also to perform quantitative region-of-interest measurements of signal intensities at four defined measurement sites. The measurements were compared with those obtained for a patient population with healthy mandibles. RESULTS: It was possible to interpret MR images in 21 cases. MR imaging findings showed that the neurovascular bundle had been cut in two patients and was intact in the remaining 19 patients. These MR imaging findings were confirmed intraoperatively in all cases. Although we found no significant signal intensity differences between patients with intact nerves and patients with cut nerves, we found significant differences between patients with mandibular fractures and patients with unremarkable mandibles. CONCLUSION: It is possible to diagnose the interruption of nerve continuity by using MR imaging. Signal intensity measurements in the neurovascular bundle provide no information regarding nerve continuity.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prolonged T2 relaxation time of denervated muscle has been described in several clinical and experimental studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of MR imaging in the diagnosis of neurogenic muscle disorders compared with that of clinical and electrophysiologic examination. METHODS: In a prospective study, 40 consecutive patients clinically presenting with a foot drop were included. MR imaging of the lower leg included axial T1-weighted and axial turbo inversion recovery magnitude (TIRM) sequences. Two readers blinded to clinical data evaluated T1-weighted images for anatomic localization of affected muscles and TIRM images for patterns of signal intensity increase. After MR imaging, a detailed neurophysiologic examination was performed. Cause of foot drop was independently determined on the basis of MR and electrophysiologic data. RESULTS: Clinical examination and electromyography (EMG) disclosed 20 peroneal nerve lesions, nine cases of L5 radiculopathy, and 11 nerve lesions extending beyond neural structures. MR imaging revealed three distinct patterns of signal intensity increase on TIRM images: peroneal nerve pattern, L5 pattern, and unspecific pattern. MR imaging and EMG findings were in agreement in 37 (92%) of 40 patients. In three patients, MR imaging revealed a more widespread involvement than did EMG. In one of these patients, denervation in the corresponding muscle was validated by follow-up EMG. No false-negative diagnoses were made by use of MR imaging as compared with use of EMG. CONCLUSION: MR imaging improves accuracy in the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve lesions compared with that of EMG and can supplement EMG in the diagnosis of denervated muscles.

AB  - A 20-year-old man with mild myopathy, external ophthalmoparesis, epilepsy, and diffuse white matter hyperintensity in the brain on magnetic resonance imaging had partial merosin deficiency in muscle and absent merosin in the endoneurium. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities were slow. Nerve biopsy showed reduction of large myelinated fibers, short internodes, enlarged nodes, excessive variability of myelin thickness, tomacula, and uncompacted myelin, but no evidence of segmental demyelination, naked axons, or onion bulbs. Thus, in congenital muscular dystrophy, merosin expression may be dissociated in different tissues, and the neuropathy is sensory-motor and due to abnormal myelinogenesis.

AB  - Objective: Diabetes mellitus has a high incidence in general population and goes by high morbidity by specific micro vascular pathology in the retina, renal glomerul and peripheral nerves. In type 1 DM, intensive therapy can prevent or delay the development of long-term complications associated with DM but hypoglycaemia especially severe hypoglycaemia defined, as a low blood glucose resulting in stupor, seizure, or unconsciousness that precludes self-treatment is a serious threat. Hypoglycaemia that may preferentially harm neurons in the medial temporal region, specifically the hippocampus, is a potential danger for the brain cognitive function which several studies failed to detect any significant effects, whereas others indicated an influence on it. A young diabetic case presented here with severe cognitive defect. Great number of severe hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic attacks and convulsion episodes were described in his medical history. Results and conclusion: Neuroradiologic findings on CT and MRI, pointed that global cerebral atrophy that is incompatible with his age. Brain perfusion studies (SPECT, 99mTc-labeled HMPAO) also showed that there were severe perfusion defects at superior temporal region and less perfusion defects at gyrus cingulim in frontal region. These regions are related with memory processing. Severe cognitive defect in this patient seems to be closely related these changes and no another reason was found to explain except the repeated severe hypoglycaemic episodes.

AB  - Injury to the central and peripheral nervous systems is an increasingly frequent consequence of standard radiation treatment protocols for tumors involving or adjacent to nervous system structures. Characteristic temporal, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory features distinguish a number of specific radiation injury syndromes, but meticulous and repeated evaluations over time are often required to establish a diagnosis. These syndromes vary with regard to prognosis and therapeutic options, and competing diagnoses with very different natural histories and therapies often mask or mimic the signs and symptoms of radiation-related nervous system injury. The ability to efficiently negotiate this complicated differential diagnostic landscape allows for early diagnosis of tumor recurrence or an alternative etiology, prompt institution of appropriate therapy, avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic studies, and confident prognostication for patients and families. Even after the diagnosis of a radiation-related complication is made, continued vigilance for additional sites or manifestations of radiation injury is mandatory. Meanwhile, further research into treatment, prevention, and the causes of individual susceptibility to radiation injury are essential.

AB  - Advances in ultrasound technology have made it possible to gain higher spatial resolution and even depict nerves with excellent visual quality. In this article, the literature concerning sonography in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is critically reviewed. We searched Medline for studies on sonography in the diagnosis of CTS and used the reference lists of the articles found. A total of seven studies on the diagnostic capabilities of sonography was found. There were considerable differences in study design. A reliable diagnosis of CTS could be made sonographically, mainly based on an increase in cross-sectional area of the median nerve at the level of the pisiform or hamate bone. However, most studies could not compare the diagnostic capabilities of sonography to those of electrodiagnostic studies, because the latter was applied as the gold standard. Several other reports on the possible extra value of sonography in CTS are considered. It is probable that sonography will not replace electrodiagnostic studies, but may serve as an additional investigation. To gain further insight into the possible additional value of sonography, it is necessary to examine subcategories of CTS patients in which electrodiagnostic studies are equivocal.

AB  - X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy caused by mutations in the connexin 32 (Cx32) gene. Cx32 is widely expressed in brain and peripheral nerve, yet clinical manifestations of CMTX mainly arise from peripheral neuropathy. We have evaluated two male patients with CMTX who on separate occasions developed transient ataxia, dysarthria, and weakness within 3 days of returning from ski trips at altitudes above 8,000 feet. Magnetic resonance imaging studies in both patients showed nonenhancing, confluent, and symmetrical white matter abnormalities that were more pronounced posteriorly and that resolved over fseveral months. Magnetic transfer images in one patient demonstrated increased magnetization transfer ratios distinct from that seen in demyelination or edema. Both patients returned to their normal baseline within 2 to 3 weeks. These cases suggest that CMTX patients are at risk for developing an acute, transient, neurological syndrome when they travel to places at high altitudes and return to sea level. Cx32 mutations may cause central nervous system dysfunction by reducing the number of functioning gap junctions between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, making both cells more susceptible to abnormalities of intercellular exchange of ions and small molecules in situations of metabolic stress.

AB  - This study was undertaken to analyze MRI findings in leprosy patients with neuropathic feet, which are suspected of having osteomyelitis. As far as we know, there is no literature concerning osteomyelitis and MRI in neuropathic leprosy feet at present. Therefore, we have included MRI examination of 18 events of suspected osteomyelitis in 12 leprosy patients. All patients with long-standing neuropathic foot problems were clinically suspected of having osteomyelitis. All patients underwent the MRI protocol with the inclusion of Two Point Dixon Chemical Shift Imaging as a fat-suppression sequence. For the MRI evaluation, we used signs that are described in literature for detecting osteomyelitis in diabetic feet. The primary MRI signs were positive in 17 of 18 patients. The secondary MRI signs were positive in 100% of the patients. Our results show that MRI with the use of Two Point Dixon Chemical Shift Imaging is a promising diagnostic modality to detect osteomyelitis in the presence of neurosteoarthropathic changes in patients with leprosy. Whenever available, MRI could play an important role in detecting osteomyelitis in leprosy patients with long-standing neuropathic feet.

AB  - In Vivo Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI) can now be used to elucidate and investigate major nerve pathways in the brain. Nerve pathways are constructed by a) calculating a continuous diffusion tensor field from the discrete, noisy, measured DT-MRI data and then b) solving an equation describing the evolution of a fiber tract, in which the local direction vector of the trajectory is identified with the direction of maximum apparent diffusivity. This approach has been validated previously using synthesized, noisy DT-MRI data. Presently, it is possible to reconstruct large white matter structures in the brain, such as the corpus callosum and the pyramidal tracts. Several problems, however, still affect the method's reliability. Its accuracy degrades where the fiber-tract directional distribution is non-uniform, and background noise in diffusion weighted MRIs can cause computed trajectories to jump to different tracts. Nonetheless, this method can provide quantitative information with which to visualize and study connectivity and continuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating architectural features in other fibrous tissues and ordered media.

AB  - The proton transverse-relaxation spectrum of peripheral nerve has been reported to consist of three components arising from microanatomical water compartments within the nerve. The component with the shortest decay time has been consistently seen to be a result of the myelin. In this study, experiments were performed to reveal the microanatomical sources of the two longest-lived components. Transverse-relaxation spectra were repeatedly obtained from samples of sciatic nerve of Xenopus laevis, the African clawed frog. These samples were maintained in vitro in a perfusion chamber, allowing for "on-the-fly" changes in perfusate composition. The changes in composition involved the addition of either 10-mM Mn2+ or 30-mM Gd-DTPA to the perfusate, or the replacement of H2O in the perfusate by D2O. The D2O experiments revealed that &gt;98% of the signal attributed to the nerve resulted from exchangeable water. Following the introduction of a paramagnetic agent into the perfusate, it was found that the intermediate-lived component of the nerve T2 spectra disappeared within 10-50 min. However, the shortest- and longest-lived components remained, experiencing much more gradual long-term changes. It was thus concluded that the intermediate-lived component corresponds to the interaxonal compartment of nerve tissue based upon its closer proximity to the outside environment of the nerve. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - This paper will review the study of the neuropathology of Rett syndrome as it has evolved through several phases. In the 1986 the first descriptions of the Rett brain, by Seitelberger and Jellinger, identified that the brains were small, and that there was quantitatively less melanin in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra than in non-Rett brains. There were reports of non- specific gliosis and cell loss in the spinal cords and in the cerebellum, but with traditional neuropathology techniques there were no pathognomonic features that defined a specific neuropathology for Rett syndrome. This apparent absence of pathology was enigmatic in view of the profound clinical phenotype which involved dysfunction of cortex, basal ganglia, the limbic. autonomic and peripheral nervous systems. In the 1990's evaluation of the accumulating and careful reports of the clinical, functional, anatomic and chemical features of Rett syndrome suggested that the basis of Rett syndrome could be an interruption of brain development. MRI and autopsy examinations revealed that the brain in Rett syndrome was small, and that, unlike the brain in a degenerative disease, it did not become progressively smaller over time. Moreover, only the brain, and no other organ was small, emphasizing the susceptibility of the nervous system in the Rett disorder. Using Golgi studies a selective alteration in the size of dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the frontal, motor and temporal lobes was defined. Regional decreases of dendritic spines were also observed and immunocytochemical studies defined alterations in synaptic sites, early response gene activity and interneurons. MAP-2 immunoreactivity was found to be altered in selected neuronal populations. Studies of neurotransmitters using various techniques in various brain regions and CSF defined alterations (increases or decreases) in most systems, with only, according to Wenk, the studies of the cholinergic system being consistently decreased. The hypothesis that there are decreased neurotransmitters in Rett syndrome remains attractive, for it explains many of the functional deficits in Rett syndrome, and suggests a mechanism for defective brain maturation. However, the measurement of neurotransmitters and the interpretation of the results is problematic; the studies have included girls and women at various stages of the Rett disorder, using numerous techniques and various Rett tissues. In 2000 Rett families and researchers rejoiced at the long awaited identification of a mutated gene in Rett syndrome. Now MeCP2 is the focus of research into the neuropathology of Rett syndrome. An understanding of how this DNA methylating protein contributes to normal brain development should allow us to understand the deficits in Rett syndrome. Most importantly, it may allow us to devise strategies for therapy. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The pathogenesis of diabetic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP) is poorly understood but there is some evidence that the disease process might extend beyond peripheral nerves. We used magnetic-resonance imaging to measure spinal-cord cross-sectional area in diabetic patients with and without DSP and in healthy controls. There were significant differences in cord area between the groups at C4/5 and T3/4 (p=0.004 and p=0.033, respectively), with a smaller cord area in those with DSP compared with controls (p=0.001 and p=0.016 for C4/5 and T3/4, respectively). These results indicate that DSP is not simply a disease of the peripheral nerve and that there is substantial involvement of the spinal cord.

AB  - Magnetic resonance techniques have become increasingly important in neurology for defining: 1 brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerve or muscle structure; 2 pathological changes in tissue structures and properties; and 3 dynamic patterns of functional activation of the brain. New applications have been driven in part by advances in hardware, particularly improvements in magnet and gradient coil design. New imaging strategies allow novel approaches to contrast with, for example, diffusion imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, perfusion imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging. In parallel with developments in hardware and image acquisition have been new approaches to image analysis. These have allowed quantitative descriptions of the image changes to be used for a precise, non-invasive definition of pathology. With the increasing capabilities and specificity of magnetic resonance techniques it is becoming more important that the neurologist is intimately involved in both the selection of magnetic resonance studies for patients and their interpretation. There is a need for considerably improved access to magnetic resonance technology, particularly in the acute or intensive care ward and in the neurosurgical theatre. This report illustrates several key developments. The task force concludes that magnetic resonance imaging is a major clinical tool of growing significance and offers recommendations for maximizing the potential future for magnetic resonance techniques in neurology.

AB  - Alpha-mannosidosis is a disease caused by the deficient activity of alpha-mannosidase, a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the degradation of glycoproteins. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides within lysosomes. The purpose of this study was to characterize the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) myelin abnormalities in cats from a breeding colony with a uniform mutation in the gene encoding alpha-mannosidase. Three affected cats and 3 normal cats from 2 litters were examined weekly from 4 to 18 wk of age. Progressively worsening neurological signs developed in affected cats that included tremors, loss of balance and nystagmus. In the PNS, affected cats showed slow motor nerve conduction velocity and increased F-wave latency. Single nerve fiber teasing revealed significant demyelination/remyelination in affected cats. Mean G-ratios of nerves showed a significant increase in affected cats compared to normal cats. Magnetic resonance imaging of the CNS revealed diffuse white matter signal abnormalities throughout the brain of affected cats. Quantitative magnetization transfer imaging showed a 8%-16% decrease in the magnetization transfer ratio in brain white matter of affected cats compared to normal cats, consistent with myelin abnormalities. Histology confirmed myelin loss throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. Thus, histology, electrodiagnostic testing, and magnetic resonance imaging identified significant myelination abnormalities in both the PNS and CNS that have not been described previously in alpha-mannosidosis.

AB  - Background: The frequency of the association between chronic demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) and central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating lesions is probably underestimated.Objective: To investigate the occurrence of combined central and peripheral demyelination in CIDP patients and to correlate visual evoked potential (VEP) abnormalities with CNS demyelinating lesions, observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and antibodies against glycolipids.Methods: Nerve conduction studies, brain MRI and antibodies against glycolipids were prospectively studied in 17 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria proposed for CIDP (Cornblath DR, Asbury AK, Albers JW, Feasby TE, Hahn AF, McLeod JG, Mendell JR, Parry GJ, Pollard JD, Thomas PK. Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task Force. Research criteria for diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Neurology, 1991;41:617-618). VEPs were performed in each case before and after 6 months treatment with either intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or steroids.Results: Eight patients (47%) had increased latencies in at least one eye or showed increased interocular latency difference. Four patients (23%) presented a significant high signal intensity on T2-weighted brain MRI images. Of these 4 patients, 3 had prolonged VEP latency. Two patients with delayed VEP latency had antibodies against GM1, and SGLPG and anti-sulfatides, respectively. One patient with normal VEPs also had antibodies to GM1. VEP results were not significantly modified after treatment, either with steroids or IVIG.Conclusion: This study confirmed the high frequency of abnormal VEPs in CIDP patients, and found that they are poorly correlated with CNS demyelinating lesions and antibodies against glycolipids. The VEP abnormalities of these patients may be explained by the susceptibility to immune-mediated damage of both the peripheral nervous system and the optic nerve.

AB  - Fiber tract trajectories in coherently organized brain white matter pathways were computed from in vivo diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) data. First, a continuous diffusion tensor field is constructed from this discrete, noisy, measured DT-MRI data. Then a Frenet equation, describing the evolution of a fiber tract, was solved. This approach was validated using synthesized, noisy DT-MRI data. Corpus callosum and pyramidal tract trajectories were constructed and found to be consistent with known anatomy. The method's reliability, however, degrades where the distribution of fiber tract directions is nonuniform. Moreover, background noise in diffusion-weighted MRIs can cause a computed trajectory to hop from tract to tract. Still, this method can provide quantitative information with which to visualize and study connectivity and confinuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating architectural features in other fibrous tissues and ordered media.

AB  - Objective. To analyze peripheral nerves with ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR) in leprosy and assess the role of imaging in leprosy patients. Design and patients. Fifty-eight nerves with abnormal clinical features or electromyograms were examined in 23 leprosy patients by means of gray-scale US, Doppler US and MR imaging. Image analysis included: measurement of nerve cross-sectional area; assessment of nerve structure and MR signal intensities; identification of nerve compression within osteofibrous tunnels; detection of endoneural color flow signals and Gd-DTPA enhancement. Correlations were made with clinical findings and a control group of 20 subjects. Fourteen nerves in active reversal reaction were followed up after therapy. Results. Leprosy nerves were classified into three groups based on imaging appearance: group I consisted of 17 normal-appearing nerves; group II, of 30 enlarged nerves with fascicular abnormalities; group III, of 11 nerves with absent fascicular structure. Group II nerves were from patients subjected to reversal reactions; 75% of patients with group III nerves had a history of erythema nodosum leprosum. Nerve compression in osteofibrous tunnels was identified in 33% of group II and 18% of group III nerves. Doppler US and MR imaging were 74% and 92% sensitive in identifying active reactions, based on detection of endoneural color flow signals, long T2 and Gd enhancement. In 64% of cases, follow-up studies showed decreased color flow and Gd uptake after steroids and decompressive surgery. Conclusions. US and MR imaging are able to detect nerves abnormalities in leprosy. Active reversal reactions are indicated by endoneural color flow signals as well as by an increased T2 signal and Gd enhancement. These signs would suggest rapid progression of nerve damage and a poor prognosis unless antireactional treatment is started.

AB  - A 7-year-old female presented with fever, urinary incontinence, mental regression, gait disturbance, and lethargy after diarrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal T2-weighted hypersignal lesions supportive of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Her mother had been diagnosed with hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsy. The girl was also determined to have hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy, with a 1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2 encompassing the gene for peripheral myelin protein 22 detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Hereditary peripheral neuropathies may be a factor in triggering the autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - This report details previously undescribed sonographic findings in the anterior interosseous nerve syndrome. Loss of muscle bulk, increased reflectivity, reduced perfusion on Doppler sonography, and lack of active contraction of the affected muscles were observed. These findings can aid in the localization of the pathologic process and in the exclusion of tendon rupture. Dynamic observation of muscle function and Doppler changes after exercise can also help identify the muscles involved. Both sonography and MRI may be useful in the evaluation of patients with the anterior interosseous nerve syndrome and other peripheral neuropathies.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the potential of two-point Dixon chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging to achieve uniform fat suppression in the distal parts of the extremities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two-point Dixon chemical shift imaging was performed in 31 consecutive patients clinically suspected to have bone marrow disease. In some patients, Dixon studies were performed before and after the intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, and in some patients follow-up examinations were performed, for a total of 64 studies. Areas of interest were the hand, wrist, foot, ankle, and lower leg. There was a special interest in the neuropathic foot and osteomyelitis. The uniformity of fat suppression in the entire field of view, the frequency of displacement artifacts, and the applicability of the technique in routine patient treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: In 64 (100%) Dixon studies, uniform fat suppression was achieved. In 59 (92%) studies, there were no displacement artifacts. In five (8%) studies, displacement artifacts occurred; however, in only one (2%) study did they severely hamper the reading. Thus, in 63 (98%) studies, adequate diagnostic quality was obtained. CONCLUSION: Two-point Dixon chemical shift imaging is a good technique for achieving uniform fat suppression in the distal parts of the extremities. Because the frequency of displacement artifacts is low, the technique is applicable in a routine clinical setting.

AB  - Background: Ataxia is the commonest neurological manifestation of coeliac disease. Some individuals with genetic susceptibility to the disease have serological evidence of gluten sensitivity without overt gastrointestinal symptoms or evidence of small-bowel inflammation. The sole manifestation of disease in such patients may be ataxia. We describe the clinical, radiological, and neurophysiological features of this disorder. Methods: Patients with ataxia attending the neurology outpatient clinics at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK, were screened for gluten sensitivity as shown by the titre of antibody to gliadin. Those with other causes of ataxia were excluded. We carried out clinical, neurophysiological, neuroradiological, and, in two cases, neuropathological examinations. Findings: 28 patients with gluten ataxia were identified. All had gait ataxia and most had limb ataxia. Those with more severe gait ataxia had longer disease duration. No patient had tremor or other extrapyramidal features. 19 patients showed some form of peripheral neuropathy on neurophysiological examination. 16 patients had no gastrointestinal symptoms. Distal duodenal biopsy showed lymphocytic infiltration in two patients, and changes compatible with coeliac disease in 11. Six patients had evidence of cerebellar atrophy on magnetic-resonance imaging. Necropsy was done on two patients who died; there was lymphocytic infiltration of the cerebellum, damage to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and sparse infiltration of the peripheral nerves. Interpretation: Gluten sensitivity is an important cause of apparently idiopathic ataxia and may be progressive. The ataxia is a result of immunological damage to the cerebellum, to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and to peripheral nerves. We propose the term gluten ataxia to describe this disorder.

AB  - We report here a study of longitudinal relaxation (T1) and magnetisation transfer (MT) in peripheral nerve. Amphibian sciatic nerve was maintained in vitro and studied at a magnetic field strength of 3 T. A CPMG pulse sequence was modified to include either a saturation pulse to measure T1 relaxation or an off-resonance RF irradiation pulse to measure MT. The resulting transverse relaxation (T2) spectra yielded four components corresponding to three nerve compartments, taken to result from myelinic, axonal, and inter-axonal water, and a fourth corresponding to the buffer solution water in which the nerve sample was bathed. Each nerve component was analysed for T1 relaxation and MT. All three nerve T2 components exhibited unique T1 relaxation and MT characteristics, providing further support for the assignment of the components to unique physical compartments of water. Numerical investigation of T(1sat) measurements of each of the three nerve T2 components indicates that while the two shorter-lived exhibit similar steady-state magnetisation transfer ratios (MTRs), their respective MT properties are quite different. Simulations demonstrate that mobile water exchange between these two components is not necessary to explain their similar steady-state MTR. In the context of the assignment of these two components to signal from myelinic and axonal water, this is to say that these two microanatomical regions of nerve may exhibit similar steady-state MTR characteristics despite possessing widely different MT exchange rates. Therefore, interpreting changes in MTR solely to reflect a change in degree of myelination could lead to erroneous conclusions.

AB  - The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the potential of MR imaging to depict morphologic alterations of the median nerve correlating with the stage of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Eighteen wrists of normal subjects and 81 wrists of patients with CTS were examined. MR imaging was performed with proton-density- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences. Staging of CTS was done on the basis of clinical and electrophysiological testing, including evaluation of the number of previous steroid infiltrations in conservative treatment. Median nerve flattening, cross-sectional area, and signal intensity were measured from the distal radius to the end of the carpal tunnel. Delineation and structure of the median nerve were recorded qualitatively by two experienced radiologists in consensus. Three major MR imaging criteria of early CTS were (a) isolated prestenotic and intracarpal swelling of the median nerve (P < .01), (b) the absence of significant flattening, and (c) a generalized increase in signal intensity retrograde to the distal radius (P < .01). The nerve showed sharply delineated contours and a homogeneous signal pattern. Advanced CTS was characterized by retrograde swelling of the median nerve to the distal radius (P < .01) and decreased signal intensity (P < .05). Demarcation of the nerve became poorer, and its signal pattern appeared fasciculated. After steroid infiltration, the median nerve was difficult to delineate, showed an inhomogeneous structure, and swelling was less pronounced than without steroid infiltration (P < .05). MR imaging yields typical morphologic findings that correlate with the duration and severity of median nerve compression. Hence, MR imaging allows staging of median nerve compression in CTS and thus may contribute to therapeutic decision-making.

AB  - Background and Objectives. Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) is a technique that is worthwhile for anesthesiologists because it allows spinal cord and plexus anatomy to be visualized three dimensionally and followed over time in the same animal. For example, the long-term effect of indwelling intrathecal or plexus catheters can be studied in situ, and convective and diffusive forces within intrathecal, epidural, or nerve sheath spaces can be investigated. Further, diffusion-weighted MRM, which measures an 'apparent diffusion coefficient' (ADC), can be used to track the presence of ischemia, hypoperfusion, or cytotoxic edema. This study investigates problems associated with the use of in vivo MRM for spinal cord and peripheral nerve studies in the rat. Methods. Twenty-one anesthetized female Fisher CDF rats were used. Group 1 (n = 7) was used for anatomic three-dimensional studies. Groups 2 (n = 4), 3 (n = 4), and 4 (n = 6) were used for measurements of the ADC. Group 2 served as controls, group 3 received lumbar intrathecal catheters, and group 4 received cervical intrathecal catheters. Results. Cervical spine, lumbar spine, and spinal nerves and ganglia were accurately visualized with MRM. As a rule, spinal cord gray and white matter were better demonstrated using diffusion-weighted proton stains. By contrast, T2-weighted proton staining superiorly demonstrated structures surrounding the spinal cord. In groups 3 and 4, indwelling intrathecal catheters did not affect the spinal cord ADC, indicating normal blood flow and no cytotoxic edema. Contrast studies revealed nonhomogeneous distribution of contrast predominately in the lateral and ventral intrathecal space. Conclusions. Three-dimensional diffusion-weighted MRM displays cervical and lumbar spine anatomy accurately in vivo. Apparent diffusion coefficients measurements are feasible in rat cervical spinal cord with intrathecal catheters. Spinal cord ADCs are unaffected by intrathecal catheters, indicating normal spinal cord perfusion.

AB  - Seventy-seven families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia were analyzed for the CAG repeat expansions causing spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, and 6. The SCA1 mutation accounted for 9%, SCA2 for 10%, SCA3 for 42%, and SCA6 for 22% of German ataxia families. Seven of 27 SCA6 patients had no family history of ataxia. Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length in all subtypes. Yet the average effect of one CAG unit on onset age was different for each SCA subtype. We compared clinical, electrophysiological, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to identify phenotypic characteristics of genetically defined SCA subtypes. Slow saccades, hyporeflexia, myoclonus, and action tremor proposed SCA2. SCA3 patients frequently developed diplopia, severe spasticity or pronounced peripheral neuropathy, and impaired temperature discrimination, apart from ataxia. SCA6 presented with a predominantly cerebellar syndrome and patients often had onset after 55 years of age. SCA1 was characterized by markedly prolonged peripheral and central motor conduction times in motor evoked potentials. MRI scans showed pontine and cerebellar atrophy in SCA1 and SCA2. In SCA3, enlargement of the fourth ventricle was the main sequel of atrophy. SCA6 presented with pure cerebellar atrophy on MRI. However, overlap between the four SCA subtypes was broad.

AB  - The MR imaging features of a paraganglioma of the cauda equina with associated spinal cord cysts are presented. MR imaging showed the tumor to be isointense with the spinal cord on all pulse sequences and to enhance homogeneously. The intramedullary cysts had increased signal intensity on proton density- and T2-weighted images, and involved the cervical and thoracic regions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinically symptomatic carpal tunnel syndrome is not necessarily accompanied by impaired nerve conduction values. Surgical decompression, however, may immediately lead to complete and lasting relief of symptoms in these patients. Because minimally invasive techniques have reduced perioperative morbidity and vocational impairment related to operative decompression, the decision to decompress symptomatic patients (despite still unimpaired nerve conduction values) might be subject to discussion in the future. New diagnostic tools may be helpful in deciding which therapeutical options to choose. When the wrist is held either in flexion or in extension, the carpal tunnel pressure increases. To investigate the dynamic changes of the carpal tunnel shape during wrist motion, as well as the variations of space for the median nerve and its signal intensity in T2-weighting, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on patients and healthy volunteers alike. Restitution and the persistence of pathological findings were assessed pre- and postoperatively. METHODS: MRI (1.0 T) was performed on 20 wrists of patients with clinical symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and pathological nerve conduction values. Healthy volunteers (20 wrists) were matched according to sex and age. MRI was performed in neutral, 45-degree extension, and 45-degree wrist flexion positions. T2- weighted signal intensity of the median nerve was measured in 18 patients pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS: The cross-sectional area of the carpal tunnel in patients with CTS tends to be smaller than that found in nonsymptomatic volunteers. The cross-sectional area of the carpal tunnel decreases during wrist flexion at the pisiform and hamate level. During wrist extension, the cross-sectional area of the carpal tunnel decreases at the level of the pisiform. During extension, it increases at the level of the hamate. The cross-sectional area of the median nerve showed an increase at the pisiform level (P < 0.05), a flattening of the median nerve at the hamate hook level (P < 0.05), and palmar deviation of the flexor retinaculum at the pisiform and hamate hook level (P < 0.001). This was significantly greater in CTS patients than in individuals with normal wrists. Postoperatively, the distal flattening of the median nerve recovered in 94% of the cases reviewed. Although the signal intensity of the median nerve on T2-weighted images decreased by 67%, the motor latency recovered in only 39% of the cases. CONCLUSION: The carpal tunnel was smaller in CTS patients than in healthy volunteers. During flexion and extension, the space available for the median nerve narrows. This may lead to potential median nerve compression. MRI is accurate and reliable for diagnosis and postoperative follow-up of carpal tunnel syndrome. In cases with obvious clinical symptoms and yet not measurably impaired median nerve conduction values, it may be helpful in making a decision for surgical decompression.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. The authors evaluate the changes in magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation times of rat skeletal muscles in vivo after nerve injury and during neural recovery, and determine the major determinants of relaxation times. MATERIALS. Magnetic resonance relaxation times, blood volume, and water and fat content were examined after nerve injury and during recovery with time course. RESULTS. Nerve injury led to longer T2 values compared with controls, but there were no significant changes in T1 values. After the initial prolongation of T2 after nerve injury, no changes were observed. Neural recovery resulted in a return of T2 values to normal. The time course of changes in blood volume was similar to that of changes in T2, and T2 values were correlated strongly with 19-fluorine-MR spectroscopy estimates of blood volume (r2=0.94). CONCLUSIONS. T2 values may be useful to monitor recovery after nerve injury and may be related to the blood volume in skeletal muscle.

AB  - The 2H double-quantum-filtered (DQF) NMR spectrum of isolated rat sciatic nerve, equilibrated with deuterated saline, is composed of three quadrupolar-split water signals. On the basis of the time course of their shift by Co-EDTA2- and CoCl2, the signals with quadrupolar splittings of about 120, 470, and 9 Hz were assigned to water in the epineurium, endoneurium, and intraaxonal compartments, respectively. The signal of the bulk water, which experiences isotropic motion, was eliminated by the DQF pulse sequence. As the maximum intensities of the water signals in the three anisotropic compartments occur at different creation times, in the DQF pulse sequence, it is possible to resolve the signals and measure their properties, such as relaxation times, independently, without perturbing the system with shift reagents. © 1997 Academic Press.

AB  - The multiexponential T2 relaxation spectrum of peripheral nerve undergoing Wallerian degeneration has been measured both in vivo and in vitro. Degeneration of the sciatic nerve of the amphibian Xenopus laevis was induced by crush injury, and T2 relaxation spectra of the nerve were measured at several times up to 35 days following injury. Histologic evidence verified that the nerve underwent Wallerian degeneration. Relaxation spectra were observed to undergo measurable changes as degeneration progressed, the most evident being a reduction from three well-resolved T2 components to one and a decline in the fraction of the spectra associated with the shortest T2 component. The former appears to reflect the collapse and loss of myelinated fibers, while the latter a combination of interstitial edema and myelin loss.

AB  - Intraoperative measures of functioning brain are an important aspect to understanding normal and diseased cortical response. Previous studies, in animal models, have used optical reflectance maps to illustrate the location and timing of functional activity. We used optical reflectance mapping in patients undergoing parietal tumor resection to reveal the temporal/spatial evolution of perfusion and other related metabolic responses of sensorimotor cortex to peripheral somesthetic stimulation. The somatosensory cortex of seven anesthetized patients was mapped in response to transcutaneous electrical median and ulnar nerve stimulation using optical reflectance imaging. The time course and spatial extent of this response were measured end cor related with evoked potential maps collected during the same conditions.Observable signals first appeared within 1-2 sac, peaked at 3 sec, and disappeared by 9 sec. These signals colocalized with the largest evoked potentials in both the sensory and motor regions end demonstrated topological specificity with median and ulner nerve stimulation. Maps of this temporal/spatial resolution illustrate the integrative and dynamic nature of the neurenal, vascular, and metabolic responses of human cortex. These data also provide insight to the mechanisms responsible for signals obtained using other brain imaging techniques such as PET end fMRI. © 1995 Oxford University Press.

AB  - It is demonstrated that multi-exponential transverse (T2) relaxation components can be estimated from multi-echo images of peripheral nerve. Three T2-relaxation components with T2 values ± standard deviations (populations ± standard deviations) of 19 ± 7 ms (26 ± 9%), 63 ± 31 ms (29 ± 11%) and 241 ± 24 ms (45 ± 7%) have been identified in vivo in the sciatic nerve of the amphibian Xenopus laevis. The longer-lived component, not identified previously in vivo, provides a significant contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between nerve and muscle in the latter-echo images. It is shown that the CNR can be further improved by the averaging of selected images from the multi-echo set. © 1995.

AB  - WE UNDERTOOK A prospective study of 43 wrists in 32 patients who had been clinically diagnosed as having carpal tunnel syndrome (study group) and 5 wrists in people who had no symptoms (control group), correlating the clinical, electrodiagnostic, intraoperative, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. MRI of the carpal tunnel and thenar eminence was performed, using coronal and axial T1- and T2-weighted, proton density, and short tau inversion recovery sequences. Abnormalities of the median nerve, as revealed by MRI, were found in 43 of 43 (100%) wrists in the study group and in 0 of 5 (0%) wrists in the control group. Increased signal of the median nerve was seen in 41 of 43 (95%) wrists, increased signal of the flexor tendon sheath in 41 of 43 (95%), volar bowing of the flexor retinaculum in 39 of 43 (91%), increased distance between the flexor tendons in 37 of 43 (86%), and abnormal nerve configuration in 28 of 43 (65%). Increased short tau inversion recovery signal of the thenar muscles was found in 5 of 43 (12%) wrists, all of which had undergone severe denervation changes, as revealed by electromyography. Operative release was performed for 27 of 43 (63%) wrists, and follow-up was obtained for 42 of 43 (98%). A good or excellent postoperative outcome resulted for 20 of 27 (74%) patients, a fair outcome for 2 of 27 (7%), and a poor outcome for 4 of 27 (15%), and 1 of 27 (4%) patients was lost to follow-up. For patients undergoing carpal tunnel release whose MRI revealed an abnormal nerve configuration, the outcome was improved, with good or excellent results in 15 of 18 (83%) patients. No association with outcome was seen with median nerve or flexor tendon signal changes, increased interspace between the flexor tendons, or flexor retinaculum bowing. Our results indicate that MRI is a sensitive diagnostic modality that can demonstrate signal and configurational abnormalities of the median nerve in patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Increased signal of the thenar muscles, as revealed by MRI, using short tau inversion recovery sequences, occurs only in muscles that have undergone severe denervation changes, as revealed by electromyography.

AB  - We examined 62 patients (72 hands) with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the carpal tunnel and latency measurements of the median nerve. In 32 of 72 hands a probable causative lesion of the CTS was identified by MRI, for example tenosynovitis, a cyst-like structure, or an aberrant muscle. The MRI findings were confirmed by surgery in 16 of 24 hands, slightly corrected in 5, and not substantiated in 3. In 65 of 72 hands, MRI disclosed pathology of the median nerve, most prominently an enlargement of the nerve at the level of the os pisiforme, a finding not seen during surgery. Oedema of the nerve was found in 14 of 72 hands. The distal latencies were prolonged in 62 of 72 hands. The sensory latencies correlated significantly with the MRI-determined cross-sectional area of the nerve at the level of the distal radius. The lack of other correlations suggests that partly independent features of the nerve lesion are demonstrated in each method or that the sensitivity and specificity of both methods are limited. Further experience with MRI in CTS is desirable. At present, the practical use of MRI in CTS should be restricted to special diagnostic problems such as carpal tunnel syndromes which do not respond adequately to conservative or surgical treatment. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This report describes a subependymoma of the filum terminale evaluated by MRI. The mass demonstrated hyperintense signal on conventional spin echo Tl-weighted, proton density, and T2-weighted imaging and nonenhancement after intravenous gadolinium administration. These characteristics distinguish this lesion from other more common neoplastic and inflammatory lesions arising in the lumbar spinal canal that are typically isointense on Tl- weighted spin echo acquisitions, hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and enhance variably after intravenous gadolinium administration. © 1994 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

AB  - The incidence of seizures increases significantly after age 60, mainly because of an associated rise in the prevalence of such etiologies as stoke, brain tumors, and toxic metabolic disturbances, including alcohol or drug misuse and diabetes. The differential diagnosis must rule out transient ischemic attacks, syncope, and psychiatric disorders, among other conditions. Treatment is based on the underlying cause. Seizures caused by toxic metabolic disturbances are treated by correcting the underlying condition. Those with other etiologies require single drug therapy with an anticonvulsant, such as phenytoin, valproic acid or carbamazepine.

AB  - To compare the efficacies of fast spinecho (FSE) and inversion-recovery FSE (IRFSE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in evaluating head and neck disorders, the authors evaluated 46 lesions in 23 consecutive patients. Twenty-seven lesions were related to neoplasms; 19 lesions resulted from infectious, allergic, or radiation-induced inflammation. Conventional T1-weighted, FSE, and IRFSE images were obtained in all patients. The FSE and IRFSE images were qualitatively compared in an unblinded manner for conspicuity of lesion margins and extent. IRFSE imaging improved conspicuity of 22 lesions (48%) and showed equal conspicuity of 18 (39%). IRFSE imaging proved most useful for small lesions with long T2 relaxation times that were surrounded by fat. IRFSE imaging improved visibility of small optic nerve gliomas, salivary gland inflammation, peripheral nerve tumors, and small lymph nodes. Early changes secondary to spread of tumor across fascial planes were also well visualized with IRFSE sequences. In six lesions (13%) that did not have long T2 relaxation times, the FSE images provided better conspicuity. The authors conclude that by improving conspicuity of small lesions adjacent to or surrounded by fat, IRFSE sequences can supplement FSE sequences in imaging the head and neck.

AB  - We have made cross‐sectional image “neurograms” in which peripheral nerve has a greater signal intensity than that of other tissue. Neurographic images of the rabbit forelimb were obtained using a spin‐echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that combines fat suppression and diffusion weighting. After fat suppression the nerve shows up in relative isolation and is brighter than the surrounding tissue due to its longer T2 relaxation time of ≈ 50 ms compared to ≈ 27 ms for muscle. The addition of pulsed gradients for diffusion weighting of the MR signal further enhances the intensity of the nerve signal relative to that of surrounding muscle tissue. The greater diffusional anisotropy of nerve tissue (D∥/D∥ = 3.1) compared to that of muscle (D∥/D∥ = 1.9) allows further enhancement of the nerve by a subtraction of two diffusion‐weighted images, one with the gradients oriented parallel and one with the gradients oriented perpendicular to the nerve orientation. We show that by manipulation of the MRI parameters, either echo time or pulsed gradient strength, the nerves can be made to show up as the most intense feature. This verifies the feasibility of generating three‐dimensional “neurographic” images, analogous to angiograms, but which demonstrate the peripheral nerve tracts in apparent isolation.© 1992 Academic Press,Inc.

AB  - Axonotmesis of the left sciatic nerve was performed on adult male Wistar rats. T1 values of the crushed nerve samples were determined with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Denervation changes of the dependent hind plantar flexor muscles were assessed with proton magnetic resonance imaging of their cross-sectional area and muscle force measurements. However, Tl relaxation time of the crushed nerve samples remained prolonged implying the absence of nerve regeneration. This would be in contradiction with what is known about regeneration after simple crash and the muscle force and magnetic resonance imaging measurements of the dependent plantar flexor muscles. These studies indicated that sufficient nerve regeneration had taken place to restore their muscle force and volume. A model is suggested to explain the persistence of prolonged Tl values in the presence of muscle force recovery. © 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - THE FORCE AND fatigue of the wrist extensor muscles during maximal voluntary and tetanic contractions were measured and compared in the injured and noninjured extremities of 11 patients with radial nerve gap injury and in 9 normal volunteers. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the wrist extensor muscles was determined by magnetic resonance imaging and was correlated with force. In the patient group, an average of three (range, 2–4) sural nerve cable grafts, measuring 11.5 ± 5 cm (range, 5–20 cm) in length, were sutured to the nerve stumps at least 9 years before this study. Differences in the CSA values of the injured and noninjured arms were compared, and a ratio was established (CSAR). The mean CSAR was 82.9% ± 14.3. These differences were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.10, paired t-test). Despite very well-recovered muscular mass, the maximal voluntary contraction force was found to be incompletely recovered by up to 62.7% ± 23, when compared with the noninjured side (P &lt; 0.05, paired t-test). The fraction maximal voluntary contraction force/CSA had decreased by up to 76.4% ± 25.5 (P &lt; 0.05, paired t-test). An increased fatigability of the affected muscles persisted in all patients. The patients' noninjured extremity behaved in the same way as that of the dominant extremity of normal volunteers with regard to force, lever, and CSA values. In the best-recovered patients, the relation of the maximal voluntary contraction force between the noninjured and the injured side was the same (90% ± 9.9) as that found between the dominant and the nondominant extremity of normal volunteers (P &lt; 0.05, paired t-test). In more than half of the patients, sural nerve cables provided adequate reinnervation of the wrist extensor muscles to enable them to recover and even to exceed the bottom 5% contraction force (139 N) reported by other authors for the normal male population. Several anatomical features of the radial nerve, however, also participated in a favorable outcome of the motor function after autografting of this nerve. © by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

AB  - To assess the utility of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) and of MR imaging in the evaluation of spinal cord tumors, ten consecutive patients were prospectively evaluated. T1-proton density-, and T2-weighted images were obtained in sagittal or axial planes. T1-weighted images were obtained before and after intravenous administration. Five tumors were within the cervical spinal cord; 3 neoplasms were within the thoracic cord; 1 neoplasm extended from the cervical to the thoracic cord and 1 neoplasm extended from the cervical cord to the conus medullaris. Four tumors were ependymomas; 3 were astrocytomas; 1 was an hemangioblastoma, and 1 was a metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The remaining patient died prior to spinal surgery and no autopsy was obtained. Of the precontrast sequences, tumors were best evaluated using T1-weighted images. Abnormal findings included cord widening, presence of a tumor mass, intratumoral or other associated cyst(s), and hemorrhage. Nevertheless, T1-weighted images obtained following the administration of GD were superior relative to all other pre- and post-contrast sequences for defining tumor margins, characterizing cyst(s) and delineating tumor masses. Based primarily on their appearance on post-contrast T1-weighted images, tumor-associated cysts could be subcategorized into 3 types: intratumoral cysts (found within the contrast-enhancing soft tissue mass); nonenhancing extratumoral cysts (found either rostral or caudal to the enhancing tumor mass); and enhancing extratumoral cysts (having an enhancing wall or containing an enhancing nodule). Our results indicate that T1-weighted MR images obtained both before and after administration of Gd are sufficient for characterizing the varying components of intramedullary spinal cord tumors. This information assists in treatment planning and follow-up of patients with these tumors. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate 22 histologically proven peripheral nerve sheath tumors, approximately two-thirds of which arose in the lower extremity. The histologic distribution was as follows: 12 schwannomas, 7 neurofibromas, and 3 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (2 of which occurred in patients with neurofibromatosis). Most lesions demonstrated an intermediate to moderately bright signal on T1-weighted images and were minimally inhomogeneous. All lesions were moderately bright on proton-density-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images, again with variable inhomogeneity. The extent of the tumor was best assessed on proton-density- and T2-weighted images. Smooth margins were noted in 19 lesions. Of the 3 remaining lesions, 2 were malignant (but had been subjected to biopsy prior to MRI), and the other lesion was a plexiform neurofibroma. MRI accurately determined the relationship between the lesion and the adjacent neurovascular structures and muscles, thereby assisting surgical management. On MRI, 5 lesions demonstrated coexistent subtle muscle atrophy along the longitudinal axis of surrounding or distally innervated musculature. This latter finding, together with the presence of a tumor in the vicinity of a large nerve trunk, suggests a peripheral nerve sheath neoplasm. © 1991 International Skeletal Society.

AB  - Two promising advances in MRI have recently evolved Water proton directional “diffusion” as well as “perfusion” processes can be imaged in a rapid (on the order of milliseconds) and accurate manner. MR diffusion imaging is shown to effectively allow determination of the presence of anisotropic water diffusion in animal and human cerebral and spinal white matter and in peripheral nerves. In another important application, the measured apparent water proton diffusion is observed to be significantly slowed in cerebral gray matter within the first minutes following experimental stroke suggesting that MRI could be useful in rapid initial assessments of ischemic damage. MR contrast media can cause regional signal changes due to either magnetic susceptibility-induced T2 shortening or to paramagnetic-induced T1 shortening. The passage of a contrast bolus through the microcirculation can be monitored using high-speed MRI and can provide significant contrast enhancement in ischemic and normally perfused tissues. © 1991 Aspen Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Seventeen benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors were studied using MR. In all cases T2 relaxation time, signal intensity on Tl-weighted images (lesion/muscle ratio), detectability of nerve of origin, nerve-lesion relationship, and presence of a capsule were assessed. Sixteen tumors showed marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted images with T2 relaxation times values >95 ms. One schwannoma was almost isointense with fat (T2 60 ms). All lesions were isointense with muscle on Tl-weighted images. In schwannomas the nerve was usually situated at the periphery of the lesion and only in one case was it obliterated by the mass. In neurofibromas the nerve was either visible in a central position within the mass (two cases) or no longer visible (five cases). A capsule could be detected in 70% of the schwannomas and in 30% of the neurofibromas. In patients with soft tissue masses, MR may contribute to recognition of nerve sheath tumors by showing the nerve of origin and typical signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. It can also be helpful in distinguishing between schwannomas and neurofibromas by the location of the nerve of origin and the presence of a capsule. © 1991 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

AB  - Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of a case of Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD) using a 1.5 T system is described. The patient showed progressive spastic diplegia with equinovarus deformity of the feet, dystonic postural movements, dysarthria, dysphagia, mental deterioration, optic nerve atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. These clinical features were compatible with HSD. Symmetrical, decreased signal intensity was seen on both proton density weighted and T2-weighted spin echo images in the globus pallidus as well as in the substantia nigra (Group I). This MR finding suggests an increased iron deposition in these subcortical nuclei, which is characteristic of HSD. The characteristic MR imaging, together with the relevant clinical features, was considered to be useful for establishing the diagnosis of HSD © 1988 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

AB  - We examined two patients with optic nerve evulsion as well as nasal peripapillary retinal and retinal pigment epithelial evulsion after ocular trauma. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated an intact peripapillary choriocapillaris, loss of peripapillary retina and retinal pigment epithelium, and complete disruption of retinal perfusion. We have postulated a mechanism for traumatic peripapillary retinal evulsion involving severe anterior displacement and abduction of the globe that may explain how the disruptive force was transmitted to the nasal retinal nerve fiber layer. We have provided a clinical correlation with magnetic resonance imaging of the optic nerve and globe of a normal individual. © 1987.

AB  - Orbital fat surrounding the optic nerve causes considerable difficulties in NMR imaging due to its high image intensity and the chemical shift artefact. We have investigated the ability of inversion recovery seqeunces with short inversion times (STIR sequences) to suppress fat signals in imaging the optic nerve. We have also compared the contrast attainable with STIR sequences with that obtainable from other sequences. Measurements were made on 4 normal controls and 5 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) to obtain typical values of relaxation times and proton densities for orbital fat, cerebral white matter and MS lesions. The fat T1 measurements were used to predict an appropriate inversion time for the STIR sequence and estimate how much residual fat signal might be expected as a result of natural variations in fat T1. STIR sequences can be used to suppress the signal from orbital fat with little residual signal. Measurements from white matter and MS lesions were used to predict the contrast between normal and pathological tissues that is attainable with STIR sequences. STIR contrast compares favourably with that obtainable from other sequences. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - High‐field strength (1.5 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging in 15 patients with multiple and extensive white‐matter lesions and clinically definite multiple sclerosis delineated a previously underscribed finding of abnormally Decemberreased signal intensity on T2‐weighted images in the thalamus and putamen. The Decemberreased signal intensity (preferential Decemberreased T2 relaxation time) is most likely to be related to abnormally increased iron accumulation causing local magnetic field heterogeneities.

AB  - We examined the hypothesis that the polyol accumulation resulting from chronic galactose supplementation in the diet produces endoneurial edema that can be prevented by inhibition of aldose reductase. We explored the potential of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to quantitate and characterize the water accumulation in the sciatic nerve in this "galactose neuropathy." The data demonstrate a 16% increase in gravimetrically determined total water content of nerve in the galactose-fed rat after 8 mo of this diet and a 50% increase in the T1 relaxation time for nerve water as determined by NMR spectroscopy. Prolongation of the T1 relaxation time reflects increased rotation of water in a magnetic field, consistent with an extracellular site of the additional water. Simultaneous feeding of sorbinil to inhibit aldose reductase resulted in normalization of both total nerve water and of the prolongation of T1 relaxation time. These data define the NMR-spectroscopic state of endoneurial edema in the galactose-fed rat and suggest specific application to the investigation of the role of aldose reductase in human diabetic neuropathy.

AB  - A field mapping technique was used to detect changes in the local magnetic field in 14 tumors, five hematomas, one lacunar infarct, and two cases of multiple sclerosis. These changes were attributed to variations in the tissue susceptibility. A partial or complete rim of changed susceptibility was detected at the margin of five of the tumors and localized changes were seen within two of the tumors. All five hematomas displayed susceptibility effects. These were seen at the rim of the hematoma in all cases but central effects were also seen in four cases. One area of probable lacunar infarction also displayed susceptibility effects. The effects described may be due to the paramagnetic contribution of species such as deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, free ferric iron, hemosiderin, and other breakdown products of blood. Local field inhomogeneities due to changes in tissue susceptibility have implications for magnetic resonance (MR) image interpretation and the performance of MR spectroscopy. © Raven Press, New York.

AB  - Magnetic Resonance Imaging was performed in more than 200 patients with clinical suspicion or knowledge of Multiple Sclerosis. One hundred and forty-seven (60 males and 87 females) had MR evidence of multiple sclerosis lesions. The MR signal of demyelinating plaques characteristically has prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times and the T2-weighted spin-echo sequences are generally superior to the T1-weighted images because the lesions are better visualized as areas of increased signal intensity. MR is also able to detect plaques in the brainstem, cerebellum and within the cervical spinal cord. MR appears to be an important, non-invasive method for the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis and has proven to be diagnostically superior to CT, evoked potentials (EP) and CSF examination. In a selected group of 30 patients, with the whole battery of the relevant MS studies, MR was positive in 100%, CT in 33,3%, EP in 56% and CSF examination in 60%. In patients clinically presenting only with signs of spinal cord involvement or optic neuritis or when the clinical presentation is uncertain MR has proven to be a very useful diagnostic tool for diagnosis of MS by demonstrating unsuspected lesions in the cerebral hemispheres. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Magnetic resonance (MR) images - both nonenhanced and enhanced with gadolinium DTPA/dimeglumine (Gd) - were compared with high-iodine (88.1 g I) computed tomographic (HICT) scans in demonstrating lesions in 15 patients known to have multiple sclerosis (MS). T1-weighted, mixed (T1, proton density, and T2), and T2-weighted MR pulse sequences were used. More than 20 lesions in each of 14 patients were demonstrated by pre-Gd mixed images and T2WI. Nine patients had clinical symptoms of active disease. Gd-enhanced T1WI showed at least one lesion that appeared to correspond with newly reported symptoms or signs. In addition, three clinically stable patients showed enhancement. Enhancement was best seen on 3-minute T1WI. HICT scans showed enhancement in four of the nine patients with active disease and in none of five clinically stable patients. Gd-enhanced MR imaging appears to be more sensitive than HICT in the detection of the transient abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier that occur in patients with active MS and appears capable of distinguishing active lesions that may correspond to the anatomic regions responsible for abnormal clinical findings.

AB  - Proton MR relaxation times T1 and T2 were determined in vitro in 136 small specimens of astrocytomas grades I-IV, of oligodendrogliomas, metastases of adenocarcinomas, meningiomas and acoustic neuromas. In addition, 7 samples of peritumoural white matter were analysed. The analysed specimens were studied microscopically in their entirety regarding tumour type and occurrence of necrosis and non-tumour tissue admixture, such as fibrosis and haemorrhage. Most of the gliomas had longer relaxation times than normal white matter and T2 was significantly longer than in the other three tumour groups. The metastases had longer T1 than normal white matter, while T2 varied. The astrocytomas tended to show shorter relaxation times with increasing degree of malignancy, and shortening of T1 and T2 correlating with the proportion of tissue necrosis. Similarly, the metastases with tissue necrosis had shorter T1 and T2 than non-necrotic samples. The meningiomas had T1 values comparable with normal cortex, while the T2 values varied. Tumours containing a large proportion of fibrous tissue had shorter relaxation times than the others. Acoustic neuromas had only slightly longer T1 than normal white matter, while T2 was not prolonged. Both T1 and T2 were significantly shorter than in all other tumours studied. Peritumoural white matter had prolonged relaxation times compared with normal white matter, correlating to increased water content. These in vitro differences regarding relaxation times in various types of tumours of the central nervous system, dependent on various types of tissue alterations, should be of interest for the interpretation of in vivo images.

AB  - Our present understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis is discussed in relation to the views of Sir William Gowers. He perceived that both environmental and genetic factors might be implicated in the aetiology of the disease. Evidence for the former was first reported in 1903, but has become convincing only in the past 20 years; the nature of the environmental factor remains obscure. Evidence for a genetic influence on susceptibility has accumulated since the 1930s, the most compelling coming from the recent Canadian twin study. The number and mode of operation of the genetic factors is still uncertain, but there is eivdence for the implication of genetically controlled cellular immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of the disease. The precise relationship between transient changes in immunological status and the development of new lesions has yet to be defined; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) promises to play a significant role in this analysis because of its sensitivity in detecting abnormalities in multiple sclerosis. MRI is not in itself specific; it is probable that the similar appearances in multiple sclerosis and cerebral vascular disease both derive at least in part from the influence of astrocytic gliosis on proton content and distribution. The significance of the gliosis is uncertain. Gowers believed that the primary defect in multiple sclerosis lay in the astrocyte. Recent observations on the immunological functions of this cell in vitro suggest that it could be involved early in the pathogenesis of the lesion.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the cerebral white matter of three subject groups: (1) 22 patients with known multiple sclerosis (MS) (11 with disease of shorter duration (0–5 years) and 11 with disease of longer duration (&gt;5 years)); (2) 9 patients with suspected MS; and (3) 12 normal volunteers. Transverse spin‐echo (SE) 30/ 500 and 120/1000 radiofrequency pulse sequences were used for anatomic localization and plaque identification, respectively, while combined spin echo‐inversion recovery was used for T1 determination. T1 values were calculated for grossly normal cerebral white matter in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes of normal volunteers and MS patients, and for plaques in MS patients. When compared with normals, the T1 values of plaquefree areas from definite MS patients (shorter and longer duration disease groups combined) were significantly longer in the frontal lobe (MS = 374 ± 34 ms, Normal = 352 ± 39 ms, P &lt; 0.05) and in the occipital lobe (MS = 414 ± 37, Normal = 378 ± 40, P &lt; 0.02). Although the T1 values of the shorter duration MS group were longer than those of normals, the difference was not statistically significant. Thus, the significant difference between the definite MS group (both shorter and longer duration) is more heavily weighted by the longer duration MS group. T1 values in patients with suspected MS without plaques were not significantly different from those of normals. In diagnosed MS patients, T1 values of plaques were significantly longer than T1 values of corresponding normal areas (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, plaque‐free white matter in patients with clinically diagnosed MS has longer T1 values than white matter in normals, suggesting the presence of biophysical abnormalities which are not seen on other routine imaging modalities. These differences may be accentuated as the disease progresses. Thus, it may be possible in the future to evaluate MS disease activity based on T1 characteristics of normal appearing white matter. © 1986 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations were performed in ten patients with 12 acoustic neuromas before and after intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). The degree of enhancement was greatest with the inversion recovery sequence 1,500/500/44 (repetition time [TR]/inversion time/echo delay time [TE]), followed by spin-echo (SE) 544/44 (TR/TE) sequences, then by SE 1,500/44 and SE 1,500/80 sequences. After enhancement there was a 50% reduction for measured T1 values, 33% for T2, and no significant change for proton density. There were no toxic effects on patients. Enhanced CT scans failed to demonstrate lesions in six of 12 cases. Air-CT technique improved sensitivity in four of five cases. Enhanced MR imaging added significant clinical information in two small intracanalicular tumors and in one recurrent tumor.

AB  - Fourteen patients and five healthy individuals underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to determine an effective multiple spin echo pulse sequence for estimating T2. Lesions examined included infarction, glioma, multiple sclerosis, and acute hematoma. A pulse repetition time (TR) of 1,500 msec and echo delays (TEs) of 25, 50, 75, and 100 msec were used. Computed T2 images were derived from all four echoes, the first two echoes, and the first and fourth echoes. T2 values were obtained from specific brain locales using region-of-interest analysis. Use of either the first two echoes or the first and fourth in the T2 fit provided T2 estimates which closely correlated with that of the four-echo analysis. The noise level in T2 maps constructed from the 25- and 100-msec echoes was modestly (typically 10%) higher than that from four echoes; noise level from the 25- and 50-msec echoes was markedly higher, typically 60%. This behavior is remarkably consistent with that predicted from theory. All 19 subjects displayed consistent relative T2 values for specific brain structures; in 13, the absolute T2 values fell within a limited range. Despite the high sensitivity of T2 images, their specificity in the detection of most brain disease appears limited except in acute intra-cerebral hematoma, which exhibited a decreased T2 relaxation time using high-field-strength MR imaging.

AB  - The clinical application of the intravascular paramagnetic contrast agent gadolinium-DTPA for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging of tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) has been assessed over the past 3 years. Various patterns of contrast enhancement were observed, and situations in MRI where the administration of contrast medium may be useful have been defined. These include lesions which are isointense with normal brain matter, the separation of tumour from surrounding oedema, evaluation of the degree of blood-brain barrier breakdown, delineation of tumours obscured by overlying calcification on computed tomography (CT) and in the investigation of lesions in anatomical areas where CT has known limitations (brain stem, cervical spine). Changes in relaxation times in normal and abnormal tissues following contrast medium, toxicity and dosage of gadolinium-DTPA, and MRI pulse sequence techniques are reviewed.

AB  - The choline-containing phospholipids of mammalian membranes have been biosynthetically deuterated by raising rats on a diet supplemented with [HOCH2CH2N(CD3)3]+C1 or [HOCD2CH2N-(CH3)3]+C1. Deuterium NMR spectra have been obtained from excised deuterated brain, sciatic nerve, heart, and lung, from isolated brain myelin and brain microsomes, and from aqueous dispersions of lipid extracts. Measurements of residual quadrupole splittings for excised deuterated neural tissues demonstrate that the orientational order of the choline head group is similar to that observed in model membranes. The spin-lattice relaxation time of the choline head group in deuterated neural tissue is indistinguishable from that observed in model membranes. These results support the proposal that the conformation and motional dynamics of the choline head groups of the bulk choline-containing lipids of neural tissue are similar to those in model membranes. Spectra of biosynthetically deuterated brain myelin and brain microsomes exhibit similar quadrupole splittings. Since these membranes have significantly different protein contents, these results indicate that no strong polar interactions exist between membrane proteins and the choline head groups of choline-containing membrane lipids. Spectra of intact deuterated heart and lung exhibit broad lines and a range of quadrupole splittings. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these tissues, interpretation is difficult. However, no strong ordering of the lipid head group by protein is indicated. © 1985, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The potential clinical importance of T1 and T2 relaxation times in distinguishing normal and pathologic tissue with magnetic resonance (MR) is discussed and clinical examples of cerebral abnormalities are given. T1 and T2 values may be used in three ways: (a) Relative values, obtained by an analysis of intensity images with varying dependence on T1 and T2, may be used if absolute values for T1 and T2 are not required for diagnosis. (b) If an absolute value is desired, the numerical values for the relaxation times may be generated using a region of interest on the intensity images. (c) In cases in which both T1 and T2 change may require a calculated image to indicate the contribution of each to the signal intensity, the numerical value may be used to generate analogue images of T1 or T2 calculations. Five patients with cerebral infarction, 15 with multiple sclerosis, two with Wilson disease, and four with tumors were imaged. Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents were distinguished using the spin echo technique. In the patients with multiple sclerosis, lesions had prolonged T1 and T2 times, but the definition of plaque was limited by spatial resolution. No abnormalities in signal intensity were seen in the patient with Wilson disease who was no longer severely disabled; abnormal increased signal intensity in the basal ganglia was found in the second patient with Wilson disease. Four tumors produced abnormal T1 and T2 relaxation times but these values alone were not sufficient for tumor characterization.

AB  - Wallerian degeneration of rat sciatic nerves was induced by nerve section. Fifteen days later the degenerated nerves were compared with the intact contraleteral nerves from the same animal. Histological sections showed the changes typical of wallerian degeneration: axonal degeneration and secondary demyelination. The freshly dissected nerves were analyzed by magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy at 10 MHz, and the water content was determined by dehydration. In the degenerated nerves there was a marked prolongation of both T1 and T2 relaxation times, accompanied by an increase of water content. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of MR for detection of secondary demyelination and disintegration of nerve structures. These results suggest that it should be possible to detect wallerian degeneration in MR images; this will have an important impact on neuropathological diagnosis of central and peripheral nervous system lesions.

AB  - An in vitro study of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) response of protons in normal and pathological human skeletal muscle is presented. Muscle biopsies from 34 patients with various neuromuscular diseases and five normal subjects were studied by proton NMR techniques and the results were compared with those of light and electron microscopy. Proton spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and recovery law for the nuclear magnetization have been determined at 37°C and 43.5 MHz. The T1s for normal tissues were in the 650 to 800 ms range and the recovery process was nearly exponential. Muscles with well defined neuromuscular diseases were associated with highly nonexponential relaxation processes. The relationship between morphological alterations of the muscle tissues and the proton NMR response may become the basis of a fast and simple method for the diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases. © 1983.

AB  - Three series of bicyclic, semirigid congeners of β-phenethylamine have been prepared for evaluation of the effect of ring size (and of concomitant conformational variation) on biological activity in a variety of assays for adrenergic and dopaminergic actions. Pharmacologic activity was associated with 2-aminotetralin and 2-aminoindan derivatives, but was not found with 6-aminobenzocycloheptene derivatives. Noteworthy is the ability of several aminotetralins and aminoindans to increase the hot-plate reaction time without eliciting dopaminergic effects. This action was not blocked by pretreatment with naloxone. © 1980, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two enantiomeric pairs of neuromuscular junction blocking agents were prepared in which an asymmetric carbon atom is adjacent to an asymmetric quaternized nitrogen moiety. The blocking agents were obtained from the enantiomers of laudanosine by stereoselective quaternization with benzyl and ethyl iodides. Curarimimetic potencies were measured with an in vivo cat hypoglossal nerve‐tongue muscle preparation. The studies suggest that the asymmetry present in these structures does not lead to significant differences in blocking potency between enantiomers. Copyright © 1979 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - Semisynthetic (+)‐tubocurarine chloride (II) was prepared by monoquaternization of (+)‐tubocurine. The method involved treating (+)‐tubocurine with a 0.5 M equivalent of hydrochloric acid prior to quaternization with methyl iodide, followed by neutralization and iodide‐chloride ion‐exchange. Column chromatography and crystallization procedures were utilized for pure semisynthetic II preparation. The neuromuscular junction blocking activities of the semisynthetic and commercial II were determined by the in vivo cat hypoglossal nerve‐tongue muscle preparation. No detectable differences among physical constants, spectral data, and neuromuscular junction blocking activities were noted between the commercial product and the semisynthetic II. This result substantiates the chemical and biological data for the well‐accepted new formula for II. The unexplained M + n 14 mass spectral peaks shown by the curare‐type bases are characteristic of the molecular species rather than a result of contaminants.

AB  - A proton spin-echo study of the water in the sciatic nerve trunk of the bullfrog reveals two distinct types of water as distinguished by their spin-spin relaxation times. The relative concentrations of these two types were determined for nerves which had been treated with normal Ringer's solution and also for nerves which had been treated with potassium-doped (0.15 M) Ringer's solution. In both cases the relative concentrations are the same as those previously determined through signal integration of high resolution proton magnetic resonance spectra obtained for the same systems, although the high resolution studies were performed on nerves doped with paramagnetic ions and the spin-echo studies were performed on undoped nerves. The doping procedure would appear to be a valid and very useful way of studying water in this neural system. © 1969, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.
