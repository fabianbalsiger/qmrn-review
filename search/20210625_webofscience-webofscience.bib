Title = {{Mapping the peripheral nervous system in the whole mouse via compressed
   sensing tractography}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the central
   nervous system with the rest of the body to regulate many physiological
   functions and is therapeutically targeted to treat diseases such as
   epilepsy, depression, intestinal dysmotility, chronic pain, and more.
   However, we still lack understanding of PNS innervation in most organs
   because the large span, diffuse nature, and small terminal nerve bundle
   fibers have precluded whole-organism, high resolution mapping of the
   PNS. We sought to produce a comprehensive peripheral nerve atlas for use
   in future interrogation of neural circuitry and selection of targets for
   neuromodulation. Approach. We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance
   imaging (DT-MRI) with high-speed compressed sensing to generate a
   tractogram of the whole mouse PNS. The tractography generated from the
   DT-MRI data is validated using lightsheet microscopy on optically
   cleared, antibody stained tissue. Main results. Herein we demonstrate
   the first comprehensive PNS tractography in a whole mouse. Using this
   technique, we scanned the whole mouse in 28 h and mapped PNS innervation
   and fiber network in multiple organs including heart, lung, liver,
   kidneys, stomach, intestines, and bladder at 70 mu m resolution. This
   whole-body PNS tractography map has provided unparalleled information;
   for example, it delineates the innervation along the gastrointestinal
   tract by multiple sacral levels and by the vagal nerves. The map enabled
   a quantitative tractogram that revealed relative innervation of the
   major organs by each vertebral foramen as well as the vagus nerve.
   Significance. This novel high-resolution nerve atlas provides a
   potential roadmap for future neuromodulation therapies and other
   investigations into the neural circuits which drive homeostasis and
   disease throughout the body.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Objectives To assess the interreader and test-retest reliability of
   magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry in sciatic nerve
   MR neurography (MRN). Materials and methods In this prospective study,
   21 healthy volunteers were examined three times on separate days by a
   standardized MRN protocol at 3 Tesla, consisting of an MTI sequence, a
   multi-echo T2 relaxometry sequence, and a high-resolution T2-weighted
   sequence. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), T2 relaxation time, and
   proton spin density (PSD) of the sciatic nerve were assessed by two
   independent observers, and both interreader and test-retest reliability
   for all readout parameters were reported by intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Results For
   the sciatic nerve, overall mean +/- standard deviation MTR was 26.75 +/-
   3.5\%, T2 was 64.54 +/- 8.2 ms, and PSD was 340.93 +/- 78.8. ICCs ranged
   between 0.81 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for interreader reliability and
   between 0.75 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for test-retest reliability. SEM for
   interreader reliability was 1.7\% for MTR, 2.67 ms for T2, and 21.3 for
   PSD. SEM for test-retest reliability was 1.7\% for MTR, 2.66 ms for T2,
   and 20.1 for PSD. Conclusions MTI and T2 relaxometry of the sciatic
   nerve are reliable and reproducible. The values of measurement
   imprecision reported here may serve as a guide for correct
   interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Although diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is predominantly
   considered a disorder of the peripheral nerves, some evidence for
   central nervous system involvement has recently emerged. However,
   whether or to what extent the microstructure of central somatosensory
   tracts may be injured remains unknown.
   Objective: This work aimed to detect the microstructure of central
   somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients and to correlate it
   with the severity of DPN.
   Methods: A case-control study at a tertiary referral hospital took place
   with 57 individuals with type 2 diabetes (25 with DPN, 32 without DPN)
   and 33 nondiabetic controls. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of 2
   major somatosensory tracts (the spinothalamic tract and its
   thalamocortical {[}spino-thalamo-cortical, STC] pathway, the medial
   lemniscus and its thalamocortical {[}medial lemnisco-thalamo-cortical,
   MLTC] pathway) were assessed based on diffusion tensor tractography.
   Regression models were further applied to detect the association of FA
   values with the severity of DPN in diabetic patients.
   Results: The mean FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were
   significantly lower in patients with DPN than those without DPN and
   controls. Moreover, FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were
   significantly associated with the severity of DPN (expressed as Toronto
   Clinical Scoring System values) in patients after adjusting for multiple
   confounders.
   Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated the axonal degeneration of central
   somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients with DPN. The parallel
   disease progression of the intracranial and extracranial somatosensory
   system merits further attention to the central nerves in diabetic
   patients with DPN.}},

Title = {{A Fully-Automatic Segmentation of the Carpal Tunnel from Magnetic
   Resonance Images Based on the Convolutional Neural Network-Based
   Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the common peripheral
   neuropathies. For magnetic resonance imaging, segmentation of the carpal
   tunnel and its contents, including flexor tendons and the median nerve
   for magnetic resonance images is an important issue. In this study, a
   convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which was modified by the
   original DeepLabv3 + model to segment three primary structures of the
   carpal tunnel: the carpal tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve.
   Methods To extract important feature maps for segmentation of the carpal
   tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve, the proposed CNN model termed
   modified DeepLabv3 + uses DenseNet-121 as a backbone and adds dilated
   convolution to the original spatial pyramid pooling module. A MaskTrack
   method was used to refine the segmented results generated by modified
   DeepLabv3 +, which have a small and blurred appearance. For evaluation
   of the segmentation results, the average Dice similarity coefficients
   (ADSC) were used as the performance index.
   Results Sixteen MR images corresponding to different subjects were
   obtained from the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Our proposed
   modified DeepLabv3 + generated the following ADSCs: 0.928 for carpal
   tunnel, 0.872 for flexor tendons and 0.785 for the median nerve. The
   ADSC value of 0.8053 generated the MaskTrack that 0.22 ADSC measure were
   improved for measuring the median nerve.
   Conclusions The experimental results showed that the proposed modified
   DeepLabv3 + model can promote segmentations of the carpal tunnel and its
   contents. The results are superior to the results generated by original
   DeepLabv3 +. Additionally, MaskTrack can also effectively refine median
   nerve segmentations.}},

Journal = {{YONSEI MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{431-438}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: AGel amyloidosis is systemic amyloidosis caused by pathogenic
   variants in the GSN gene. In this study, we sought to characterize the
   clinical and brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) features of Korean
   patients with AGel amyloidosis.
   Materials and Methods: We examined 13 patients with AGel amyloidosis
   from three unrelated families. Brain MRIs were performed in eight
   patients and eight age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Therein, we
   analyzed gray and white matter content using voxel-based morphometry
   (VBM), tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and FreeSurfer.
   Results: The median age at examination was 73 (interquartile range: 64
   \& ndash;76) years. The median age at onset of cutis laxa was 20
   (interquartile range: 15 \& ndash;30) years. All patients over that age
   of 60 years had dysarthria, cutis laxa, dysphagia, and facial palsy. Two
   patients in their 30s had only mild cutis laxa. The median age at
   dysarthria onset was 66 (interquartile range: 63.5 \& ndash;70) years.
   Ophthalmoparesis was observed in three patients. No patient presented
   with muscle weakness of the limbs. Axial fluid-attenuated inversion
   recovery images of the brain showed no significant differences between
   the patient and control groups. Also, analysis of VBM, TBSS, and
   FreeSurfer revealed no significant differences in cortical thickness
   between patients and healthy controls at the corrected significance
   level.
   Conclusion: Our study outlines the clinical manifestations of prominent
   bulbar palsy and early-onset cutis laxa in 13 Korean patients with AGel
   amyloidosis and confirms that AGel amyloidosis mainly affects the
   peripheral nervous system rather than the central nervous system.}},

Title = {{Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Sciatic Nerve as a Surrogate Marker for
   Nerve Functionality of the Upper and Lower Limb in Patients With
   Diabetes and Prediabetes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy (DN) is assumed to begin in the
   distal legs with a subsequent progression to hands and arms at later
   stages. In contrast, recent studies have found that lower limb nerve
   lesions in DN predominate at the proximal sciatic nerve and that, in the
   upper limb, nerve functions can be impaired at early stages of DN.
   Materials and Methods
   In this prospective, single-center cross-sectional study, participants
   underwent diffusion-weighted 3 Tesla magnetic resonance neurography in
   order to calculate the sciatic nerve's fractional anisotropy (FA), a
   surrogate parameter for structural nerve integrity. Results were
   correlated with clinical and electrophysiological assessments of the
   lower limb and an examination of hand function derived from the Purdue
   Pegboard Test.
   Results
   Overall, 71 patients with diabetes, 11 patients with prediabetes and 25
   age-matched control subjects took part in this study. In patients with
   diabetes, the sciatic nerve's FA showed positive correlations with
   tibial and peroneal nerve conduction velocities (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and
   r = 0.56; p < 0.001, respectively), and tibial and peroneal nerve
   compound motor action potentials (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and r = 0.63; p <
   0.001, respectively). Moreover, the sciatic nerve's FA was correlated
   with the Pegboard Test results in patients with diabetes (r = 0.52; p <
   0.001), prediabetes (r = 0.76; p < 0.001) and in controls (r = 0.79; p =
   0.007).
   Conclusion
   This study is the first to show that the sciatic nerve's FA is a
   surrogate marker for functional and electrophysiological parameters of
   both upper and lower limbs in patients with diabetes and prediabetes,
   suggesting that nerve damage in these patients is not restricted to the
   level of the symptomatic limbs but rather affects the entire peripheral
   nervous system.}},

Abstract = {{MR tractography of the lumbosacral plexus (LSP) is challenging due to
   the difficulty of acquiring high quality data and accurately estimating
   the neuronal tracts. We proposed an algorithm for an accurate
   visualization and assessment of the major LSP bundles using the
   segmentation of the cauda equina as seed points for the initial starting
   area for the fiber tracking algorithm. Twenty-six healthy volunteers
   underwent MRI examinations on a 3T MR scanner using the phased array
   coils with optimized measurement protocols for diffusion-weighted images
   and coronal T2 weighted 3D short-term inversion recovery sampling
   perfection with application optimized contrast using varying flip angle
   evaluation sequences used for LSP fiber reconstruction and MR
   neurography (MRN). The fiber bundles reconstruction was optimized in
   terms of eliminating the muscle fibers contamination using the
   segmentation of cauda equina, the effects of the normalized quantitative
   anisotropy (NQA) and angular threshold on reconstruction of the LSP. In
   this study, the NQA parameter has been used for fiber tracking instead
   of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the regions of interest positioning
   was precisely adjusted bilaterally and symmetrically in each individual
   subject. The diffusion data were processed in individual L3-S2 nerve
   fibers using the generalized Q-sampling imaging algorithm. Data (mean
   FA, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity, and
   normalized quantitative anisotropy) were statistically analyzed using
   the linear mixed-effects model. The MR neurography was performed in
   MedINRIA and post-processed using the maximum intensity projection
   method to demonstrate LSP tracts in multiple planes. FA values
   significantly decreased towards the sacral region (P < .001); by
   contrast, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity and
   NQA values significantly increased towards the sacral region (P < .001).
   Fiber tractography of the LSP was feasible in all examined subjects and
   closely corresponded with the nerves visible in the maximum intensity
   projection images of MR neurography. Usage of NQA instead of FA in the
   proposed algorithm enabled better separation of muscle and nerve fibers.
   The presented algorithm yields a high quality reconstruction of the LSP
   bundles that may be helpful both in research and clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction In this study, we aimed to determine whether muscle
   transverse relaxation time (T-2) magnetic resonance (MR) mapping results
   correlate with motor unit loss, as defined by motor unit recruitment
   patterns on electromyography (EMG).
   Methods EMG and 3-Tesla MRI exams were acquired no more than 31 days
   apart in subjects referred for peripheral nerve MRI. Two musculoskeletal
   radiologists qualitatively graded T-2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequences
   for severity of muscle edema-like patterns and manually placed regions
   of interest within muscles to obtain T-2 values from T-2-mapping
   sequences. Concordance was calculated between qualitative and
   quantitative MR grades and EMG recruitment categories (none, discrete,
   decreased) as well as interobserver agreement for both MR grades.
   Results Thirty-four muscles (21 abnormal, 13 control) were assessed in
   13 subjects (5 females and 8 males; mean age, 46 years) with 14 EMG-MRI
   pairs. T-2-relaxation times were significantly (P < .001) increased in
   all EMG recruitment categories compared with control muscles. T-2
   differences were not significant between EMG grades of motor unit
   recruitment (P = .151-.702). T-2 and EMG score concordance was
   acceptable (Harrell \& apos;s concordance index {[}c index]: rater A,
   0.71; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.51-0.87; rater B, 0.77; 95\%
   CI, 0.57-0.91). Qualitative MRI and EMG score concordance was poor to
   acceptable (c index: rater A, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.50-0.79; rater B, 0.72;
   95\% CI, 0.55-0.89). T-2 values had moderate-to-substantial ability to
   distinguish between absent vs incomplete (ie, decreased or discrete)
   motor unit recruitment (c index: rater A, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.50-1.00;
   rater B, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.57-1.00).
   Discussion Quantitative T-2 MR muscle mapping is a promising tool for
   noninvasive evaluation of the degree of motor unit recruitment loss.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has demonstrated key diffusion
   tensor imaging-based diffusivity alterations in the trigeminal nerve;
   however, imaging has primarily focused on the peripheral nerve segment
   because of previous limitations in reliably segmenting small fiber
   bundles across multiple subjects. We used Selective Automated Group
   Integrated Tractography to study 36 subjects with TN (right-sided pain)
   and 36 sex-matched controls to examine the trigeminal nerve (fifth
   cranial nerve {[}CN V]), pontine decussation (TPT), and thalamocortical
   fibers (S1). Gaussian process classifiers were trained by scrolling a
   moving window over CN V, TPT, and S1 tractography centroids. Fractional
   anisotropy (FA), generalized FA, radial diffusivity, axial diffusivity,
   and mean diffusivity metrics were evaluated for both groups, analyzing
   TN vs control groups and affected vs unaffected sides. Classifiers that
   performed at greater-than-or-equal-to 70\% accuracy were included.
   Gaussian process classifier consistently demonstrated bilateral
   trigeminal changes, differentiating them from controls with an accuracy
   of 80\%. Affected and unaffected sides could be differentiated from each
   other with 75\% accuracy. Bilateral TPT could be distinguished from
   controls with at least 85\% accuracy. TPT left-right classification
   achieved 98\% accuracy. Bilateral S1 could be differentiated from
   controls, where the affected S1 radial diffusivity classifier achieved
   87\% accuracy. This is the first TN study that combines group-wise
   merged tractography, machine learning classification, and analysis of
   the complete trigeminal pathways from the peripheral fibers to S1
   cortex. This analysis demonstrates that TN is characterized by bilateral
   abnormalities throughout the trigeminal pathway compared with controls
   and abnormalities between affected and unaffected sides. This full
   pathway tractography study of TN demonstrates bilateral changes
   throughout the trigeminal pathway and changes between affected and
   unaffected sides.}},

Title = {{Reduced Thalamic Volume and Metabolites in Type 1 Diabetes with

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY \& DIABETES}},
Abstract = {{Objective Thalamus is essential in processing of sensory information.
   This study explored the associations between thalamic volume and
   intra-thalamic metabolites and associations to clinical and experimental
   characteristics of sensory function in adults with diabetic
   polyneuropathy.
   Methods 48 adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed distal symmetric
   peripheral neuropathy (DPSN) and 28 healthy controls participated in a
   cross-sectional study and underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging
   scan. Estimates for thalamic volume were extracted using voxel-based
   morphometry and intra-thalamic N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/cre)
   levels were assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Associations
   between thalamic volume and clinical measures, quantitative sensory
   testing and neuropathic phenotype were explored.
   Results In diabetes, reduced gray matter volume was identified including
   bilateral thalamus (all p <= 0.001) in comparison to healthy
   participants. Thalamic volume estimates were positively associated to
   intra-thalamic NAA/cre (r=0.4; p= 0.006), however not to diabetes
   duration (p = 0.5), severity of DSPN (p= 0.7), or presence of pain (p=
   0.3). Individuals with the lowest thalamic volume had greatest loss of
   protective sensation (light touch using von Frey-like filaments, p=
   0.037) and highest pain tolerance to electric stimulation (tetanic
   stimulation, p= 0.008) compared to individuals with the highest thalamic
   volume.
   Conclusions In this cohort with type 1 diabetes and severe DSPN,
   thalamic atrophy was present and associated with reduced NAA/cre,
   indicating thalamic structural loss and dysfunction. Thalamic atrophy
   was associated to reduced sensory function involving large fiber
   neuropathy and sensation to tetanic stimulation that may reflect
   synaptic transmission. This may ultimately contribute to the current
   understanding of the pathophysiology behind the perception changes
   evident in DSPN.}},

Title = {{Mapping the rest of the human connectome: Atlasing the spinal cord and
   peripheral nervous system}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{225}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of diffusion, structural, and functional neuroimaging
   methods has enabled major multi-site efforts to map the human
   connectome, which has heretofore been defined as containing all neural
   connections in the central nervous system (CNS). However, these efforts
   are not structured to examine the richness and complexity of the
   peripheral nervous system (PNS), which arguably forms the (neglected)
   rest of the connectome. Despite increasing interest in an atlas of the
   spinal cord (SC) and PNS which is simultaneously stereotactic,
   interactive, electronically dissectible, scalable, population-based and
   deformable, little attention has thus far been devoted to this task of
   critical importance. Nevertheless, the atlasing of these complete neural
   structures is essential for neurosurgical planning, neurological
   localization, and for mapping those components of the human connectome
   located outside of the CNS. Here we recommend a modification to the
   definition of the human connectome to include the SC and PNS, and argue
   for the creation of an inclusive atlas to complement current efforts to
   map the brain's human connectome, to enhance clinical education, and to
   assist progress in neuroscience research. In addition to providing a
   critical overview of existing neuroimaging techniques, image processing
   methodologies and algorithmic advances which can be combined for the
   creation of a full connectome atlas, we outline a blueprint for
   ultimately mapping the entire human nervous system and, thereby, for
   filling a critical gap in our scientific knowledge of neural
   connectivity.}},

Title = {{Automation of Quantifying Axonal Loss in Patients with Peripheral
   Neuropathies through Deep Learning Derived Muscle Fat Fraction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Background: Axonal loss denervates muscle, leading to an increase of fat
   accumulation in the muscle. Therefore, fat fraction (FF) in whole limb
   muscle using MRI has emerged as a monitoring biomarker for axonal loss
   in patients with peripheral neuropathies. In this study, we are testing
   whether deep learning-based model can automate quantification of the FF
   in individual muscles. While individual muscle is smaller with irregular
   shape, manually segmented muscle MRI images have been accumulated in
   this lab; and make the deep learning feasible.
   Purpose: To automate segmentation on muscle MRI images through deep
   learning for quantifying individual muscle FF in patients with
   peripheral neuropathies.
   Study Type: Retrospective.
   Subjects: 24 patients and 19 healthy controls.
   Field Strength/Sequences: 3T; Interleaved 3D GRE.
   Assessment: A 3D U-Net model was implemented in segmenting muscle MRI
   images. This was enabled by leveraging a large set of manually segmented
   muscle MRI images. B-1(+) and B-1(-) maps were used to correct image
   inhomogeneity. Accuracy of the automation was evaluated using Pixel
   Accuracy (PA), Dice Coefficient (DC) in binary masks; and Bland-Altman
   and Pearson correlation by comparing FF values between manual and
   automated methods.
   Statistical Tests: PA and DC were reported with their median value and
   standard deviation. Two methods were compared using the +/- 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI) of Bland-Altman analysis and the Pearson's
   coefficient (r(2)).
   Results: DC values were from 0.83 +/- 0.17 to 0.98 +/- 0.02 in thigh and
   from 0.63 +/- 0.18 to 0.96 +/- 0.02 in calf muscles. For FF values, the
   overall +/- 95\% CI and r(2) were {[}0.49, -0.56] and 0.989 in thigh and
   {[}0.84, -0.71] and 0.971 in the calf.
   Data Conclusion: Automated results well agreed with the manual results
   in quantifying FF for individual muscles. This method mitigates the
   formidable time consumption and intense labor in manual segmentations;
   and enables the use of individual muscle FF as outcome measures in
   upcoming longitudinal studies.}},

Title = {{Fractional anisotropy thresholding for deterministic tractography of the
   roots of the brachial plexus}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, such as the fractional
   anisotropy (FA) and estimates of diffusivity are sensitive to the
   microstructure of peripheral nerves and may be displayed as tractograms.
   However, the ideal conditions for tractography of the roots of the
   brachial plexus are unclear, which represents the rationale for this
   study. Ten healthy adults were scanned using a Siemens Prisma (3T) and
   single-shot echo-planar imaging (b-value 0/1000 s/mm(2), 64 directions,
   2.5 mm(3) with 4 averages; repeated in opposing phase encoding
   directions). Susceptibility correction and tractography were performed
   in DSI Studio by two independent raters. The effect of FA thresholding
   at increments of 0.01 (from 0.04 to 0.10) were tested. The mean FA
   varied between subjects by 2\% (95\% CI 1\%, 3\%). FA thresholds of
   0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 all propagated 96\% of tracts representing the
   roots; thresholding at 0.07 yielded 4\% fewer tracts (p=0.2), 0.08
   yielded 11\% fewer tracts (p=0.008), 0.09 yielded 15\% fewer tracts
   (p=0.001) and 0.1 yielded 20\% fewer tracts (p<0.001). There was<0.1\%
   inter-rater variability in the measured FA and 99\% agreement for
   tractography (kappa =0.92, p<0.001). The fractional anisotropy
   thresholds required to generate tractograms of the roots of the brachial
   plexus appears to be lower than those used in the brain. We provide
   estimates of the probability of generating true tracts for each spinal
   nerve root of the brachial plexus, at different fractional anisotropy
   thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Management of peripheral nerve injuries requires physicians
   to rely on qualitative measures from patient history, electromyography,
   and physical exam. Determining a successful nerve repair can take months
   to years for proximal injuries, and the resulting delays in clinical
   decision-making can lead to a negative impact on patient outcomes. Early
   identification of a failed nerve repair could prevent permanent muscle
   atrophy and loss of function. This study aims to test the feasibility of
   performing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate injury and
   recovery following repair of wrist trauma. We hypothesize that DTI
   provides a noninvasive and reliable assessment of regeneration, which
   may improve clinical decision-making and alter the clinical course of
   surgical interventions. Methods: Clinical and MRI measurements from
   subjects with traumatic peripheral nerve injury, carpal tunnel syndrome,
   and healthy control subjects were compared to evaluate the relationship
   between DTI metrics and injury severity. Results: Fractional anisotropy
   from DTI was sensitive to differences between damaged and healthy
   nerves, damaged and compressed nerves, and injured and healthy
   contralateral nerves. Longitudinal measurements in two injury subjects
   also related to clinical outcomes. Implications of other diffusion
   measures are also discussed. Interpretation: DTI is a sensitive tool for
   wrist nerve injuries and can be utilized for monitoring nerve recovery.
   Across three subjects with nerve injuries, this study has shown how DTI
   can detect abnormalities between injured and healthy nerves, measure
   recovery, and determine if re-operation was successful. Additional
   comparisons to carpal tunnel syndrome and healthy nerves show that DTI
   is sensitive to the degree of impairment.}},

Title = {{Nanofibrous nerve guidance conduits decorated with decellularized matrix
   hydrogel facilitate peripheral nerve injury repair}},
Journal = {{THERANOSTICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{2917-2931}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a great challenge for
   regenerative medicine. Nerve autograft is the gold standard for clinical
   PNI repair. Due to its significant drawbacks, artificial nerve guidance
   conduits (NGCs) have drawn much attention as replacement therapies. We
   developed a combinatorial NGC consisting of longitudinally aligned
   electrospun nanofibers and porcine decellularized nerve matrix hydrogel
   (pDNM gel). The in vivo capacity for facilitating nerve tissue
   regeneration and functional recovery was evaluated in a rat sciatic
   nerve defect model.
   Methods: Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) was electrospun into randomly
   oriented (PLLA-random) and longitudinally aligned (PLLA-aligned)
   nanofibers. PLLA-aligned were further coated with pDNM gel at
   concentrations of 0.25\% (PLLA-aligned/0.25\% pDNM gel) and 1\%
   (PLLA-aligned/1\% pDNM gel). Axonal extension and Schwann cells
   migration were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining of dorsal root
   ganglia cultured on the scaffolds. To fabricate implantable NGCs, the
   nanofibrous scaffolds were rolled and covered with an electrospun
   protection tube. The fabricated NGCs were then implanted into a 5 mm
   sciatic nerve defect model in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Nerves
   treated with NGCs were compared to contralateral uninjured nerves
   (control group), injured but untreated nerves (unstitched group), and
   autografted nerves. Nerve regeneration was monitored by an established
   set of assays, including T2 values and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   derived from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
   histological assessments, and immunostaining. Nerve functional recovery
   was evaluated by walking track analysis.
   Results: PLLA-aligned/0.25\% pDNM gel scaffold exhibited the best
   performance in facilitating directed axonal extension and Schwann cells
   migration in vitro due to the combined effects of the topological cues
   provided by the aligned nanofibers and the biochemical cues retained in
   the pDNM gel. Consistent results were obtained in animal experiments
   with the fabricated NGCs. Both the T2 and fractional anisotropy values
   of the PLLA-aligned/0.25\% pDNM gel group were the closest to those of
   the autografted group, and returned to normal much faster than those of
   the other NGCs groups. Histological assessment indicated that the
   implanted PLLA-aligned/0.25\% pDNM gel NGC resulted in the largest
   number of axons and the most extensive myelination among all fabricated
   NGCs. Further, the PLLA-aligned/0.25\% pDNM gel group exhibited the
   highest sciatic nerve function index, which was comparable to that of
   the autografted group, at 8 weeks post-surgery.
   Conclusions: NGCs composed of aligned PLLA nanofibers decorated with
   0.25\% pDNM gel provided both topological and biochemical guidance for
   directing and promoting axonal extension, nerve fiber myelination, and
   functional recovery. Moreover, T2-mapping and DTI metrics were found to
   be useful non-invasive monitoring techniques for PNI treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To determine normative morphological and functional magnetic
   resonance (MR) neurography values in children and adolescents in
   correlation to demographic determinants. Methods In this study 29
   healthy underage subjects (mean age 13.9 years, range 10-17 years) were
   examined using a standardized MR neurography protocol of the lumbosacral
   plexus and the right lower extremity at 3 T. Volumes of the dorsal root
   ganglia L3-S2, cross-sectional area of the sciatic and tibial nerves, as
   well as T2-weighted contrast nerve-muscle ratio and quantitative
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) values of the sciatic nerve were obtained
   and correlated with the demographic parameters sex, age, height and
   weight. Results While all obtained morphological and functional MR
   neurography values did not differ between male and female sex, dorsal
   root ganglia volume, sciatic and tibial nerve cross-sectional area
   correlated positively with age, height, and weight. The T2-weighted
   signal of the sciatic nerve was independent of demographic determinants.
   Negative correlation was found for fractional anisotropy (FA) with age,
   height, and weight, whereas radial diffusivity (RD) showed a positive
   correlation only with age. Mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity
   (AD) revealed no correlation with demographic determinants. Conclusion
   The results of this study suggest that selection of sex-matched controls
   for further studies assessing peripheral nerve pathologies in underage
   patients may not be necessary; however, control subjects should be
   adapted to age, height, and weight of the patient population, especially
   if assessing dorsal root ganglia volume, nerve cross-sectional area and
   DTI.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Neurologic complications in coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19) have been described, but the understanding of their
   pathophysiologic causes and neuroanatomical correlates remains limited.
   Purpose: To report on the frequency and type of neuroradiological
   findings in COVID-19.
   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, all consecutive
   adult hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction positivity
   for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who underwent
   neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May
   24, 2020, were included. All examinations were systematically
   re-evaluated by 12 readers. Summary descriptive statistics were
   calculated.
   Results: A total of 185 patients with COVID-19 (62 years 6 14
   {[}standard deviation]; 138 men) underwent neuroimaging. In total, 222
   brain CT, 47 brain MRI, and seven spinal MRI examinations were
   performed. Intra-axial susceptibility abnormalities were the most common
   finding (29 of 39; 74\%, 95\% CI: 58, 87) in patients who underwent
   brain MRI, often with an ovoid shape suggestive of microvascular
   pathology and with a predilection for the corpus callosum (23 of 39;
   59\%; 95\% CI: 42, 74) and juxtacortical areas (14 of 39; 36\%; 95\% CI:
   21, 53). Ischemic and macrohemorrhagic manifestations were also
   observed, but vascular imaging did not demonstrate overt abnormalities.
   Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 19 patients did not
   reveal consistent asymmetries between hemispheres or regions. Many
   patients (18 of 41; 44\%; 95\% CI: 28, 60) had leukoencephalopathy and
   one patient had a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum. Other
   findings included olfactory bulb signal abnormalities (seven of 37;
   19\%), prominent optic nerve subarachnoid spaces (20 of 36; 56\%), and
   enhancement of the parenchyma (three of 20; 15\%), leptomeninges (three
   of 20; 15\%), cranial nerves (two of 20; 10\%), and spinal nerves (two
   of four; 50\%). At MRI follow-up, regression of leukoencephalopathy and
   progressive leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in one patient each,
   respectively, which is suggestive of dynamic processes.
   Conclusion: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 had a wide spectrum
   of vascular and inflammatory involvement of both the central and
   peripheral nervous system. (C) RSNA, 2020}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. We examined the chronic inflammatory demyelinating
   polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) patients and non-CIDP patients who have
   similar symptoms and difficult to differential diagnosis with CIDP by
   magnetic resonance neurography to find the difference among them.
   Objective. To investigate the differential diagnostic value of magnetic
   resonance neurography (MRN) for CIDP and other peripheral neuropathies.
   Summary of Background Data. Thirty-two consecutive patients with CIDP
   and 22 non-CIDP patients with symptoms similar to CIDP and difficult to
   be discriminate were recruited and imaged as a control group between May
   2017 and May 2019.
   Methods. In this prospective study, the brachial plexus and lumbosacral
   plexus of 32 CIDP patients and 22 non-CIDP patients were examined by
   MRN. The clinical features and the nerve roots cross-sectional area
   (CSA) of the brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus were measured.
   Results. The CSA of nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
   type-1 and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and
   skin changes syndrome patients were all shown extensive by MRN. The
   sensitivity of MRN in diagnosing CIDP was 81.25\% (26/32), the
   specificity was 68.18\% (15/22), the positive predictive value was
   78.79\% (26/33), the negative predictive value was 71.43\% (15/21), the
   accuracy was 75.93\% (40/54), the misdiagnosis rate was 24.07\% (13/54),
   and the kappa value was 0.498. Receiver operating characteristic
   analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for CIDP with the CSA of the
   lumbosacral plexus (area under the curve {[}AUC] = 0.762) and that of
   the brachial plexus (AUC = 0.762), and the combined of both examinations
   did not improve the diagnostic efficacy compared with either (AUC =
   0.769).
   Conclusion. The nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1,
   and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin
   changes syndrome were difficult to distinguish by MRN. Atypical CIDP
   patients had less nerve root injury compared with typical CIDP patients.
   MRN of either the brachial plexus or the lumbosacral plexus had a high
   diagnostic accuracy for CIDP, and it is not necessary to perform both
   parts of the examination.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) characterises
   tissue microstructure and provides proxy measures of myelination, axon
   diameter, fibre density and organisation. This may be valuable in the
   assessment of the roots of the brachial plexus in health and disease.
   Therefore, there is a need to define the normal DTI values. Methods The
   literature was systematically searched for studies of asymptomatic
   adults who underwent DTI of the brachial plexus. Participant
   characteristics, scanning protocols, and measurements of the fractional
   anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of each spinal root were
   extracted by two independent review authors. Generalised linear
   modelling was used to estimate the effect of experimental conditions on
   the FA and MD. Meta-analysis of root-level estimates was performed using
   Cohen's method with random effects. Results Nine articles, describing
   316 adults (1:1 male:female) of mean age 35 years (SD 6) were included.
   Increments of ten diffusion sensitising gradient directions reduced the
   mean FA by 0.01 (95\% CI 0.01, 0.03). Each year of life reduced the mean
   MD by 0.03 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s (95\% CI 0.01, 0.04). At 3-T, the pooled mean
   FA of the roots was 0.36 (95\% CI 0.34, 0.38;I(2)98\%). The pooled mean
   MD of the roots was 1.51 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s (95\% CI 1.45, 1.56;I(2)99\%).
   Conclusions The FA and MD of the roots of the brachial plexus vary
   according to experimental conditions and participant factors. We provide
   summary estimates of the normative values in different conditions which
   may be valuable to researchers and clinicians alike.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe and yet most poorly
   understood complications of diabetes mellitus.In vivoimaging of dorsal
   root ganglia (DRG), a key structure for the understanding of DPN, has
   been restricted to animal studies. These have shown a correlation of
   decreased DRG volume with neuropathic symptom severity. Our objective
   was to investigate correlations of DRG morphology and signal
   characteristics at 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance neurography (MRN)
   with clinical and serological data in diabetic patients with and without
   DPN. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent 3T MRN of
   both L5 DRG using an isotropic 3D T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence
   with subsequent segmentation of DRG volume and analysis of normalized
   signal properties. Overall, 55 diabetes patients (66 +/- 9 years; 32
   men; 30 with DPN) took part in this study. DRG volume was smaller in
   patients with severe DPN when compared to patients with mild or moderate
   DPN (134.7 +/- 21.86 vs 170.1 +/- 49.22;p= 0.040). In DPN patients, DRG
   volume was negatively correlated with the neuropathy disability score
   (r= -0.43; 95\%CI = -0.66 to -0.14;p= 0.02), a measure of neuropathy
   severity. DRG volume showed negative correlations with triglycerides (r=
   -0.40; 95\%CI = -0.57 to -0.19;p= 0.006), and LDL cholesterol (r= -0.33;
   95\%CI = -0.51 to -0.11;p= 0.04). There was a strong positive
   correlation of normalized MR signal intensity (SI) with the neuropathy
   symptom score in the subgroup of patients with painful DPN (r= 0.80;
   95\%CI = 0.46 to 0.93;p= 0.005). DRG SI was positively correlated with
   HbA1c levels (r= 0.30; 95\%CI = 0.09 to 0.50;p= 0.03) and the
   triglyceride/HDL ratio (r= 0.40; 95\%CI = 0.19 to 0.57;p= 0.007). In
   this firstin vivostudy, we found DRG morphological degeneration and
   signal increase in correlation with neuropathy severity. This elucidates
   the potential importance of MR-based DRG assessments in studying
   structural and functional changes in DPN.}},

Abstract = {{Background Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is diagnosed through
   clinical findings and genetic testing. While there are
   neurophysiological tools and clinical functional scales in CMT,
   objective disease biomarkers that can facilitate in monitoring disease
   progression are limited. Purpose To investigate the utility of diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) in determining the microstructural integrity of
   sciatic and peroneal nerves and its correlation with the MRI grading of
   muscle atrophy severity and clinical function in CMT as determined by
   the CMT neuropathy score (CMTNS). Study Type Prospective case-control.
   Subjects Nine CMT patients and nine age-matched controls. Field
   Strength/Sequence 3 T T-1-weighted in-/out-of phase spoiled gradient
   recalled echo (SPGR) and DTI sequences. Assessment Fractional anisotropy
   (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean
   diffusivity (MD) values for sciatic and peroneal nerves were obtained
   from DTI. Muscle atrophy was graded according to the Goutallier
   classification using in-/out-of phase SPGRs. DTI parameters and muscle
   atrophy grades were compared between CMT and controls, and the
   relationship between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS
   were assessed. Statistical Tests The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used
   to compare DTI parameters between CMT and controls. The relationship
   between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS were analyzed
   using the Spearman correlation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   analyses of DTI parameters that can differentiate CMT from healthy
   controls were done. Results There was a significant reduction in FA and
   increase in RD of both nerves (P < 0.05) in CMT, with significant
   correlations between FA (negative;P < 0.05) and RD (positive;P < 0.05)
   with muscle atrophy grade. In the sciatic nerve, there was significant
   correlation between FA and CMTNS (r= -0.795;P < 0.05). FA and RD could
   discriminate CMT from controls with high sensitivity (77.8-100\%) and
   specificity (88.9-100\%). Data Conclusion There were significant
   differences of DTI parameters between CMT and controls, with significant
   correlations between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grade, and CMTNS.

Abstract = {{Central nervous system involvement has been described in peripheral
   neuropathies, including different forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT)
   disease. The aimof our study was to systematically investigate possible
   brain structural modifications in CMT1A patients, using volumetric MRI,
   and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this prospective cross-sectional
   study, from May 2017 to May 2019, we acquired 3T MRI brain scans of
   genetically confirmed CMT1A patients and age- and sex-comparable healthy
   controls. Patients also underwent clinical and electrophysiological
   examinations assessing motor and sensory domains. Voxel-based
   morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses
   were performed using a non-parametric approach based on permutations,
   including age and sex (and total intracranial volume for VBM) as
   nuisance covariates. When between-group differences emerged at VBM or
   TBSS analyses, the first eigenvariate was extracted from the cluster and
   its age- and sex-adjusted standardized residuals tested for correlation
   with clinical and electrophysiological variables. Twenty CMT1A patients
   (34.5 +/- 11.1 years; M/F:11/9) were enrolled, along with 20 healthy
   controls (30.1 +/- 10.2 years; M/F:11/9). The VBM analysis revealed
   clusters of significantly increased GM volume in CMT1A patients compared
   to healthy controls, encompassing the bilateral cerebellar lobules
   III-VI and the left hippocampus (all ps = 0.04), with no differences in
   terms of DTI metrics at the TBSS analysis. A negative correlation (r =
   -0.502, p = 0.03) emerged between ulnar compound motor action potential
   and the z-scores corresponding to the right cerebellar cluster of
   augmented GM volume. Our data show evidence of structural reorganization
   in the brain of CMT1A patients, possibly reflecting neural plasticity
   mechanisms in response to peripheral nerve pathology and modulating the
   effect of axonal degeneration on functional impairment.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) has been used extensively to study
   pathological conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
   However, tissue damage is assessed qualitatively with little information
   regarding the underlying pathophysiological processes involved.
   Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) is a quantitative magnetic resonance
   imaging method which is sensitive to tissue macromolecular content and
   may therefore have an important role in the study of pathologies
   affecting the PNS. This study explored the feasibility of obtaining
   reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus of healthy
   volunteers using MRN to identify and segment each lumbar segment (L2-L5)
   and regions (preganglionic, ganglionic and postganglionic).
   Reproducibility of the MTR measurements and of the segmentation method
   were assessed from repeated measurements (scan-rescan), and from the
   reanalysis of images (intra- and inter-rater assessment), by calculating
   the coefficient of variation (COV). In all segments combined (L2-L5),
   mean (+/- SD) MTR was 30.5 (+/- 2.4). Scan-rescan, intra- and
   inter-rater COV values were 3.2\%, 4.4\% and 5.3\%, respectively.
   One-way analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant
   difference in MTR between the preganglionic and postganglionic regions
   in all lumbar segments. This pilot study in healthy volunteers
   demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in
   the proximal lumbar plexus, opening up the possibility of studying a
   broad spectrum of neurological conditions in vivo.}},

Title = {{Impact of multiple sclerosis risk loci in postinfectious neurological
   syndromes}},
Journal = {{MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{44}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: The genetic component of multiple sclerosis (MS) is now set
   to 200 autosomal common variants. However, it is unclear how genetic
   knowledge be clinically used in the differential diagnosis between MS
   and other inflammatory conditions like adult-onset postinfectious
   neurological syndromes (PINS). The aim of this study was to investigate
   whether PINS and MS have a shared genetic background using an updated
   polygenic risk scores.
   Methods: Eighty-eight PINS patients have been consecutively recruited
   between 1996 and 2016 at Mondino Foundation of Pavia, diagnosed
   according to clinical, MRI and CSF findings and followed-up for several
   years. Patients were typed using Illumina array, and genotypes imputed
   using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. A weighted genetic risk
   score (wGRS) has been calculated based on autosomal MS risk loci derived
   from large-scale studies, and an HLA genetic burden (HLAGB) was also
   calculated on loci associated to MS.
   Results: PINS occurred as an episode of myelitis in 44\% of patients,
   encephalomyelitis in 44\%, and encephalitis in remaining cases, with an
   involvement of peripheral nervous system in 41\% of patients. Mean age
   of onset was 50.1 years, and female:male ratio was 1.4. Patients were
   followed-up for a mean of 7.2 years, and at last visit 55\% had a low
   disability grade (mRS 0-1). Disease was monophasic in 67\% of patients,
   relapsing in 18\% and chronic-progressive in 15\%.
   The wGRS of PINS cases was comparable to 370 healthy controls, while
   significantly lower compared to 907 bout-onset MS (BOMS) cases
   (wGRS=20.9 vs 21.2; p<0.0001). The difference was even larger for PINS
   with peripheral nervous system involvement (wGRS=20.6) vs BOMS.
   Conclusion: The distinction between MS and PINS is not easy to make in
   clinical practice. However, our study shows that the new set of MS risk
   alleles does not confer increased susceptibility to PINS. These data
   support the importance to discriminate these cases from MS with
   pathophysiological and therapeutic implications.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To investigate whether pretreatment magnetic resonance

   invasion (PNI) status in rectal cancer (RC). Material and methods A
   total of 122 RC patients with pathologically confirmed were classified
   as training cohort (n = 87) and test cohort (n = 35). 180 radiomics
   features were extracted from all lesions based on oblique axial T2WI TSE
   images. The dimensionality reduction and feature selection in training
   cohort were realized by the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR)
   algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
   (LASSO) regression model. A predictive model combining radiomics
   features and clinical risk factors (pathological N stage, pathological
   LVI status) was established by multivariate logistic regression
   analysis. The performance of the model was assessed based on its
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, nomogram, and
   calibration. Results The developed radiomics nomogram that integrated
   the radiomics signature and clinical risk factors could provide
   discrimination in the training and test cohorts. The accuracy and the
   area under the curve (AUC) for assessing PNI status were 0.82, 0.86,
   respectively, in the training cohort, while they were 0.71 and 0.85 in
   the test cohort. The goodness-of-fit of the nomogram was evaluated using
   the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p = 0.52 in training cohort andp = 0.24 in
   test cohort). Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the radiomics
   nomogram was clinically useful. Conclusion The developed radiomics
   nomogram might be helpful in the individualized assessment PNI status in
   patients with RC. This stratification of RC patients according to their
   PNI status may provide the basis for individualized adjuvant therapy,
   especially for stage II patients.}},

Abstract = {{We systematically identified and reviewed 29 studies of peripheral nerve
   ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRN) in amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis (ALS). The majority of the ultrasound studies reported smaller
   nerves and nerve roots in ALS compared to healthy controls, but there
   was a large over-lap of the cross-sectional nerve area between ALS and
   controls. Most of the MRN studies confirmed nerve abnormalities
   demonstrating slight T2 hyperintensities and, sometimes, mild
   enlargement of more proximal nerve segments (plexus, roots) in ALS. The
   size of the proximal nerve segments, i.e. nerve roots, is thus somewhat
   incongruent between nerve ultrasound and MRN in ALS. Peripheral nerve
   ultrasound has the potential to differentiate between ALS and multifocal
   motor neuropathy (MMN) in that patients with MMN have significantly
   larger nerves. Conversely, there is an overlap of MRN abnormalities in
   ALS and MMN, restricting the techniques' utility in the clinical
   setting. A subgroup of patients with ALS seems to reveal a sonographic
   nerve pattern suggesting peripheral nerve inflammation. In the future,
   combined imaging with nerve ultrasound and MRN assessing parameters such
   as blood flow or textural markers may aid in the understanding of the
   deep nerve microstructure down to the fascicle level, and thus, in the
   classification of the nerve state as more degenerative or more
   inflammatory in ALS. This systematic review provides evidence that nerve
   imaging abnormalities are common in ALS. (C) 2020 International

Abstract = {{Purpose Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is caused by
   drug-induced damage to the axons which is not detected easily due to
   lack of reliable, clinically applicable modalities. Diffuse tensor
   imaging (DTI) allows for quantitative measurements of fractional
   anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which have
   been shown to detect nerve injury by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
   Methods We sought to evaluate if DTI could be used for detection of CIPN
   in patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane. Patients with h/o
   exposure to neurotoxic chemotherapy, diabetes, or peripheral neuropathy
   were excluded. Patients completed pre- and post-chemotherapy MRI of
   bilateral legs and FACT\&GOG-Ntx. Genotyping of single-nucleotide
   variations (SNVs) was performed to detect known associations with CIPN.
   Results We had 14 evaluable patients in this prospective trial. Mean FA
   values post-chemotherapy were significantly lower than baseline at
   mid-calf (p < 0.0001) and ankle (p = 0.03). We did not find any
   significant change in mean ADC values. In patients without symptomatic
   neuropathy, mean FA values decreased more than symptomatic patients at
   mid-calf (p < 0.001). Of the 41 genotyped SNVs, only rs8110536 was found
   to be significantly associated with development of CIPN. Conclusions Our
   results show that FA values are indicative of CIPN and differential
   changes in FA values in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients
   highlights its potential to be further studied as a predictive biomarker
   for CIPN. This is the first study to highlight a non-invasive, imaging
   based, objective biomarker which, if validated, can be translated into
   clinic easily.}},

Journal = {{ACTA RADIOLOGICA}},
Abstract = {{Background Small peripheral nerve tractography is challenging because of
   the trade-off among resolution, image acquisition time, and
   signal-to-noise ratio. Purpose To optimize pixel size and slice
   thickness parameters for fiber tractography and diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel using 3T magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI). Material and Methods Fifteen healthy volunteers
   (mean age 30 +/- 6.8 years) were recruited prospectively. Axial
   T2-weighted and DTI scans were acquired, covering the cubital tunnel,
   using different pixel sizes and slice thicknesses. Three-dimensional
   (3D) nerve tractography was evaluated for the median number and length
   of the reconstructed fiber tracts and visual score from 0 to 5.
   Two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional DTI was evaluated for fractional
   anisotropy (FA) values throughout the length of the ulnar nerve. Results
   A pixel size of 1.3 mm(2)revealed the highest number of reconstructed
   nerve fibers compared to that of 1.1 mm(2)(P = 0.048), with a good
   visual score. A slice thickness of 4 mm had the highest number of
   reconstructed nerve fibers and visual score compared with other
   thicknesses (allP < 0.05). In 2D cross-sectional images, the median FA
   values were in the range of 0.40-0.63 at the proximal, central, and
   distal portions of the cubital tunnel. Inter-observer agreement for all
   parameters was good to excellent. Conclusion For fiber tractography and
   DTI of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel, optimal image quality was
   obtained using a 1.3-mm(2)pixel size and 4-mm slice thickness under MR
   parameters of this study at 3T.}},

Title = {{Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography for preoperative assessment of

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of fiber tractography and
   diffusivity analysis generated from 3D diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences
   for preoperative assessment of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
   Method: MR imaging at 3T was performed in 22 patients (mean age 41.9 +/-
   17.1y, 13 women) with histologically confirmed schwannomas (N = 18) and
   histologically confirmed neurofibromas (N = 11), including a 3D DW turbo
   spin echo sequence with fat suppression. Diffusion tensor parameters
   were computed and fiber tracks were determined. Evaluation was performed
   by two radiologists and one orthopedic surgeon blinded for final
   diagnosis. Mean diffusivity was computed to allow further assessment of
   tumor microstructure. Preoperative fascicle visualization was graded,
   fascicles were categorized regarding anatomical location and amount of
   fascicles surrounding the tumor. The agreement of imaging findings with
   intraoperative findings was assessed.
   Results: On 78.3 \% of the DTI images, the fascicle visualization was
   rated as good or very good. Tractography differences were observed in
   schwannomas and neurofibromas, showing schwannomas to be significantly
   more often located eccentrically to the nerve (94.8 \%) than
   neurofibromas (0 \%, P < 0.01). Fascicles were significantly more often
   continuous (87.5 \%) in schwannomas, while in neurofibromas, none of the
   tracks was graded to be continuous (0 \%, P = 0.014). A substantial
   agreement between fiber tracking and surgical anatomy was found
   regarding the fascicle courses surrounding the tumor (kappa = 0.78).
   Mean diffusivity of schwannomas (1.5 +/- 0.2 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) was
   significantly lower than in neurofibromas (1.8 +/- 0.2 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s;
   P < 0.001). The Youden index showed an optimal cutoff at 1.7 x
   10(-3)mm(2)/s (sensitivity, 0.91; specificity, 0.78; J = 0.69).
   Conclusions: Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging allowed to accurately
   differentiate between schwannomas and neurofibromas and to describe
   their location in relation to the nerve fascicles for preoperative
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies
   (HNPP) is caused by a heterozygous deletion of peripheral myelin
   protein-22 (PMP22) gene resulting in focal sensorimotor deficits. Our
   lab has identified a disruption of myelin junctions in excessively
   permeable myelin that impairs action potential propagation. This
   mechanism is expected to cause fatigue in patients with HNPP. Therefore,
   the objective was to characterize fatigue in patients with HNPP and
   determine the relationship of fatigue to nerve pathology, disability,
   and quality of life. Methods Nine females with HNPP participated in a
   single visit that included genotyping, nerve conduction studies,
   neurological exam, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, and a
   physical therapy exam incorporating upper and lower extremity function
   and survey measures of fatigue. This visit was followed by 2 weeks of
   ecological momentary assessment (wrist-worn device) that captured
   fatigue ratings five times per day. Results Participants demonstrated
   mild neurological impairment (CMTNS: 5.7 +/- 2.8), yet reported high
   fatigue levels (average fatigue intensity over 2 weeks: 5.9 out of 10).
   Higher fatigue levels were associated with poorer quality of life and
   more pain. Higher fatigue was associated with significantly greater
   distal nerve proton density changes on peripheral nerve MRI, which is in
   line with hyper-permeable myelin in HNPP. Interpretation Fatigue is
   common and severe among patients with HNPP whose disabilities are
   minimal by conventional outcome measures. Therapeutic interventions
   targeting fatigue have the potential to improve quality of life and may
   serve as a robust outcome measure to show longitudinal changes for
   patients with HNPP.}},

Abstract = {{We previously reported that neuropathic pain was associated with smaller
   posterior cingulate cortical (PCC) volumes, suggesting that a
   smaller/dysfunctional PCC may contribute to development of pain via
   impaired mind wandering. A gap in our previous report was lack of
   evidence for a mechanism for the genesis of PCC atrophy in HIV
   peripheral neuropathy. Here we investigate if volumetric differences in
   the subcortex for those with neuropathic paresthesia may contribute to
   smaller PCC volumes, potentially through deafferentation of ascending
   white matter tracts resulting from peripheral nerve damage in HIV
   neuropathy. Since neuropathic pain and paresthesia are highly
   correlated, statistical decomposition was used to separate pain and
   paresthesia symptoms to determine which regions of brain atrophy are
   associated with both pain and paresthesia and which are associated
   separately with pain or paresthesia. HIV+ individuals (N = 233) with and
   without paresthesia in a multisite study underwent structural brain
   magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry and a
   segmentation/registration tool were used to investigate regional brain
   volume changes associated with paresthesia. Analysis of decomposed
   variables found that smaller midbrain and thalamus volumes were
   associated with paresthesia rather than pain. However, atrophy in the
   PCC was related to both pain and paresthesia. Peak thalamic atrophy (p =
   0.004; MNIx = - 14,y = - 24,z = - 2) for more severe paresthesia was in
   a region with reciprocal connections with the PCC. This provides initial
   evidence that smaller PCC volumes in HIV peripheral neuropathy are
   related to ascending white matter deafferentation caused by small fiber
   damage observed in HIV peripheral neuropathy.}},

Abstract = {{The group of Multiplied, Added, Subtracted and/or fiTted Inversion
   Recovery (MASTIR) pulse sequences in which usually two or more inversion
   recovery (IR) images of different types are combined is described, and
   uses for this type of sequence are outlined. IR sequences of different
   types can be multiplied, added, subtracted, and/or fitted together to
   produce variants of the MASTIR sequence. The sequences provide a range
   of options for increasing image contrast, demonstrating specific tissues
   and fluids of interest, and suppressing unwanted signals. A formalism
   using the concept of pulse sequences as tissue property filters is used
   to explain the signal, contrast and weighting of the pulse sequences
   with both univariate and multivariate filter models. Subtraction of one
   magnitude reconstructed IR image from another with a shorter T-1 can
   produce very high T-1 dependent positive contrast from small increases
   in T-1. The reverse subtracted IR sequence can provide high positive
   contrast enhancement with gadolinium chelates and iron deposition which
   decrease T-1. Additional contrast to that arising from increases in T-1
   can be produced by supplementing this with contrast arising from
   concurrent increases in rho(m) and T-2, as well as increases or
   decreases in diffusion using subtraction IR with echo subtraction and/or
   diffusion subtraction. Phase images may show 180 degrees differences as
   a result of rotating into the transverse plane both positive and
   negative longitudinal magnetization. Phase images with contrast arising
   in this way, or other ways, can be multiplied by magnitude IR images to
   increase the contrast of the latter. Magnetization Transfer (MT) and
   susceptibility can be used with IR sequences to improve contrast.
   Selective images of white and brown adipose tissue lipid and water
   components can be produced using different TIs and in and out-of-phase
   TEs. Selective images of ultrashort and short T-2 tissue components can
   be produced by nulling long T-2 tissue components with an inversion
   pulse and subtraction of images with longer TEs from images with
   ultrashort TEs. The Double Echo Sliding IR (DESIRE) sequence provides
   images with a wide range of TIs from which it is possible to choose
   values of TI to achieve particular types of tissue and/or fluid contrast
   (e.g., for subtraction with different TIs, as described above, and for
   long T-2 tissue signal nulling with UTE sequences). Unwanted tissue and
   fluid signals can be suppressed by addition and subtraction of
   phase-sensitive (ps) and magnitude reconstructed images. The sequence
   also offers options for synergistic use of the changes in blood and
   tissue rho(m), T-1, T-2/T-2{*}, D{*} and perfusion that can be seen with
   fMRI of the brain. In-vivo and ex-vivo illustrative examples of normal
   brain, cartilage, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and
   peripheral nerve imaged with different forms of the MASTIR sequence are
   included.}},

Title = {{Microstructural changes in the trigeminal nerve of patients with
   episodic migraine assessed using magnetic resonance imaging}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEADACHE AND PAIN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Background There is histological evidence of microstructural changes in
   the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve in migraineurs.
   This raises the possibility that altered trigeminal nerve properties
   contribute to migraine pathophysiology. Whilst it is not possible to
   explore the anatomy of small trigeminal nerve branches it is possible to
   explore the anatomy of the trigeminal root entry zone using magnetic
   resonance imaging in humans. The aim of this investigation is to assess
   the microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in vivo to determine if nerve
   alterations occur in individuals with episodic migraine. Methods In 39
   migraineurs and 39 matched controls, T1-weighted anatomical images were
   used to calculate the volume (mm(3)) and maximal cross-sectional area of
   the trigeminal nerve root entry zone; diffusion tensor images were used
   to calculate fractional anisotropy, mean diffusion, axial diffusion and
   radial diffusion. Results There were significant differences between the
   left and right nerve of controls and migraineurs with respect to volume
   and not cross-sectional area. Migraineurs displayed reduced axial
   diffusion in the right nerve compared to the left nerve, and reduced
   fractional anisotropy in the left nerve compared to left controls.
   Furthermore, although there were no differences in mean diffusion or
   radial diffusion, regional analysis of the nerve revealed significantly
   greater radial diffusion in the middle and rostral portion of the left
   trigeminal nerve in migraineurs compared with controls. Conclusions
   Migraine pathophysiology is associated with microstructural
   abnormalities within the trigeminal nerve that are consistent with
   histological evidence of altered myelin and/or organization. These
   peripheral nerve changes may provide further insight into migraine
   pathophysiology and enable a greater understanding for targeted
   treatments of pain alleviation.}},

Title = {{MicroCT optimisation for imaging fascicular anatomy in peripheral nerves}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{338}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Due to the lack of understanding of the fascicular
   organisation, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) leads to unwanted off-target
   effects. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) can be used to trace
   fascicles from periphery and image fascicular anatomy.
   New method: In this study, we present a simple and reproducible method
   for imaging fascicles in peripheral nerves with iodine staining and
   microCT for the determination of fascicular anatomy and organisation.
   Results: At the determined optimal pre-processing steps and scanning
   parameters, the microCT protocol allowed for segmentation and tracking
   of fascicles within the nerves. This was achieved after 24 hours and 120
   hours of staining with Lugol's solution (1\% total iodine) for rat
   sciatic and pig vagus nerves, respectively, and the following scanning
   parameters: 4 mu m voxel size, 35 kVp energy, 114 mu A current, 4
   Wpower, 0.25 fps in 4 s exposure time, 3176 projections and a molybdenum
   target.
   Comparison with existing method(s): This optimised method for imaging
   fascicles provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images and full
   imaging penetration depth not obtainable with methods typically used
   such as histology, magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence
   tomography whilst obviating time-consuming preprocessing methods, the
   amount of memory required, destruction of the samples and the cost
   associated with current microCT methods.
   Conclusion: The optimised microCT protocol facilitates segmentation and
   tracking of the fascicles within the nerve. The resulting segmentation
   map of the functional anatomical organisation of the vagus nerve will
   enable selective VNS ultimately allowing for the avoidance of the
   off-target effects and improving its therapeutic efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord injuries (SCI) normally disrupt the long axonal tracts of
   the spinal cord and cause permanent neurological deficits, for which
   there is currently a lack of effective therapeutic methods.
   Biomaterial-based regenerative medicine is a pivotal strategy to induce
   axonal regeneration through delivery of biophysical and/or biochemical
   regulatory cues by biomaterials. We previously fabricated a
   hierarchically aligned fibrin hydrogel (AFG) that could promote
   neurogenic differentiation of stem cells in vitro and has been
   successfully applied for peripheral nerve and spinal cord regeneration
   in rats. In this study, AFG was used to repair a canine lumbar segment 2
   hemisection spinal cord injury, and the consistency of histological,
   imageological and behavioral results was compared. AFG was used to
   construct an aligned fiber bridge that supported cell adhesion in vitro
   and rapidly facilitated tissue invasion along the long axis of fibers in
   vivo, Moreover, in vivo results demonstrated regrowth of axons in an
   oriented pattern connecting the rostral and caudal stumps. Consistent
   results were confirmed by diffusion tensor imaging, which allowed
   successful tracing of reconnected nerve fibers across the defect. As a
   result, directional axonal regrowth contributed to significantly
   improved recovery of motor functional behavior of SCI canines with AFG
   implantation. Our results suggest that AFG has great promise for rapidly
   directing axonal regrowth for nerve regeneration.}},

Title = {{Diffusion Tensor Imaging for Diagnosing Root Avulsions in Traumatic
   Adult Brachial Plexus Injuries: A Proof-of-Concept Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Cross-sectional MRI has modest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing
   traumatic brachial plexus root avulsions. Consequently, patients either
   undergo major exploratory surgery or months of surveillance to determine
   if and what nerve reconstruction is needed. This study aimed to develop
   a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol at 3 Tesla to visualize normal
   roots and identify traumatic root avulsions of the brachial plexus.
   Seven healthy adults and 12 adults with known (operatively explored)
   unilateral traumatic brachial plexus root avulsions were scanned. DTI
   was acquired using a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence at 3
   Tesla. The brachial plexus was visualized by deterministic tractography.
   Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated for
   injured and avulsed roots in the lateral recesses of the vertebral
   foramen. Compared to healthy nerves roots, the FA of avulsed nerve roots
   was lower (mean difference 0.1 {[}95\% CI 0.07, 0.13]; p < 0.001) and
   the MD was greater (mean difference 0.32 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s {[}95\% CI
   0.11, 0.53]; p < 0.001). Deterministic tractography reconstructed both
   normal roots and root avulsions of the brachial plexus; the
   negative-predictive value for at least one root avulsion was 100\% (95\%
   CI 78, 100). Therefore, DTI might help visualize both normal and injured
   roots of the brachial plexus aided by tractography. The precision of
   this technique and how it relates to neural microstructure will be
   further investigated in a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of
   patients with acute brachial plexus injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the
   evaluation of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) compared to clinical
   scores and nerve conduction studies (NCS). Patients and methods We
   included 30 patients with diabetes mellitus complaining of neuropathy
   symptoms and 15 healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent evaluation
   using 1.5-T DTI of median nerves and NCS. Patients underwent clinical
   evaluation using the Neuropathy Deficit Score (NDS), Neuropathy
   Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL), and Diabetic Neuropathy
   Examination (DNE) score. Results We found statistically significant
   differences between healthy volunteers and patients in fractional
   anisotropy (FA) of the distal segment (P = 0.016) and whole median nerve
   (P = 0.024), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of proximal (P =
   0.027) and distal (P < 0.001) segments, and whole median nerve (P =
   0.019). Distal segment FA was significantly correlated with NDS (P =
   0.003), DNEs (P = 0.003), sensory amplitude (P = 0.048), and motor CV (P
   = 0.020). Distal segment ADC was significantly correlated with NDS (P =
   0.007), NIS-LL (P = 0.003), DNEs (P = 0.01), and sensory amplitude (P =
   0.032). The best cut-off value of distal segment for FA was 0.45 (87\%
   sensitivity, 80\% specificity) and of distal segment ADC was 1.217 (80\%
   sensitivity and specificity). Conclusions Our results suggest that 1.5-T
   DTI examination of the median nerve can provide useful non-invasive
   information in patients with DPN.}},

Abstract = {{Background We imaged the corticospinal tract (CST) and corticoreticular
   pathway (CRP) using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) to evaluate the
   cause of muscle weakness in a patient who was exposed to high-voltage
   electricity. Case presentation A 39-year-old man presented with
   quadriparesis after high-voltage electrical shock from power lines while
   working about 5.8 years ago. The electrical current entered through the
   left hand and exited through the occipital area of the head. The degree
   of weakness on bilateral upper and lower extremities was 3-4 on the
   Medical Research Council strength scale. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   was performed 5.8 years after onset. The CST and CRP were depicted by
   placing two regions of interest for each neural tract on the
   two-dimensional fractional anisotropy color map. DTT of the DTI scan
   showed that the bilateral CST and CRP were thinned compared to those of
   the healthy control subject. On the nerve conduction test, abnormal
   findings suggesting peripheral nerve lesion were not observed.
   Therefore, injury of bilateral CST and CRP seems to have contributed to
   our patient's weakness after the electrical shock. Conclusion Depiction
   of neural tracts in the brain using DTT can assist in the accurate and
   detailed evaluation of the cause of neural deficit after electrical
   injury.}},

Abstract = {{The peripheral nervous system is increasingly being investigated using
   medical imaging as a complement or in association with
   electrodiagnostics tests. The application of imaging techniques, such as
   ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allows detailed
   visualization of the peripheral nervous system. According to the
   European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, the use of US for nerve
   evaluation is strongly encouraged. In addition, the role of US is
   further enhanced by the wide application of US-guided techniques to
   diagnose or to treat peripheral nerve disorders.
   Standard evaluation of peripheral nerves on US usually relies on
   cross-sectional area evaluation with different cutoff values in the
   osteofibrous tunnels and outside them. In several anatomical areas,
   side-to-side comparison is highly recommended because it helps
   distinguish subtle variations by using the unaffected limb as an
   internal control.
   US is widely used to perform US-guided interventional procedures on
   peripheral nerves. The recent development of radiomics and machine and
   deep learning applied to peripheral nerves may reveal new insights
   beyond the capabilities of the human eye. Radiomics may have a role in
   expanding the diagnostic capabilities of US and MRI in the study of
   peripheral nerve pathology, especially when the cross-sectional area is
   not markedly increased.}},

Abstract = {{The underlying factors contributing to metatarsophalangeal joint
   deformity, a known precursor to skin breakdown in individuals with
   diabetes mellitus (DM), is likely to involve multiple body systems. The
   purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify multi-system
   factors associated with metatarsophalangeal joint deformity in
   individuals with type 2 DM and peripheral neuropathy (n = 60).
   Metatarsophalangeal joint deformity was quantified with a computed
   tomography (CT) scan. System biomarkers included the musculoskeletal
   system (foot intrinsic muscle deterioration, tarsal/metatarsal bone
   mineral density, ankle dorsiflexion, metatarsophalangeal extension
   movement during a sit to stand task); the vascular system
   (ankle-brachial index); and the endocrine/immune systems (high
   sensitivity C-reactive protein, skin intrinsic fluorescence, and
   hemoglobin A1C). Muscle deterioration (r = 0.27), bone density (r =
   -0.35), metatarsophalangeal extension movement (r = 0.50), maximum
   dorsiflexion (r = -0.31), and ankle-brachial index (r = 0.33) were
   related to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity (p < 0.05). Bone mineral
   density and metatarsophalangeal extension movement were retained in a
   regression model relating to deformity (R-2 = 0.34). All musculoskeletal
   system biomarkers and the ankle-brachial index demonstrated weak to
   moderate relationships to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity. Bone
   mineral density of the tarsal/metatarsal bones and extending the toes
   during a sit to stand task were the two strongest factors associated
   with metatarsophalangeal joint deformity. Evaluation and management of
   foot bone mineral density and toe extension movement pattern could
   reduce metatarsophalangeal joint deformity and the risk of skin
   breakdown and subsequent amputation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nerve regeneration after an injury should occur in a timely
   fashion for function to be restored. Current methods cannot monitor
   regeneration prior to muscle reinnervation. Diffusion tensor imaging has
   been previously shown to provide quantitative indices after nerve
   recovery. The goal of this study was to validate the use of this
   technology following nerve injury via a series of rat sciatic nerve
   injury/repair studies.
   Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were prospectively divided by procedure
   (sham, crush, or cut/repair) and time points (1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks
   after surgery). At the appropriate time point, each animal was
   euthanized and the sciatic nerve was harvested and fixed. Data were
   obtained using a 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system. For
   validation, findings were compared to behavioral testing (foot fault
   asymmetry and sciatic function index) and cross-sectional axonal
   counting of toluidine blue-stained sections examined under light
   microscopy.
   Results: Sixty-three rats were divided into three treatment groups
   (sham, n = 21; crush, n = 23; and cut/repair, n = 19). Fractional
   anisotropy was able to differentiate between recovery following sham,
   crush, and cut/repair injuries as early as 2 weeks (p < 0.05), with more
   accurate differentiation thereafter. More importantly, the difference in
   anisotropy between distal and proximal regions recognized animals with
   successful and failed recoveries according to behavioral analysis,
   especially at 12 weeks. In addition, diffusion tension imaging-based
   tractography provided a visual representation of nerve continuity in all
   treatment groups.
   Conclusions: Diffuse tensor imaging is an objective and noninvasive tool
   for monitoring nerve regeneration. Its use could facilitate earlier
   detection of failed repairs to potentially help improve outcomes.}},

   Assessment Images were processed using four methods: ``original{''} (no
   denoising), ``average{''} (10 repetitions), ``PCA-only,{''} and ``PCA +
   genSD.{''} Tibial and common peroneal nerve segmentations and masks were
   generated from volunteer diffusion data. Quantitative (SNR and
   contrast-to-noise ratio {[}CNR]) values were calculated. Three
   radiologists qualitatively evaluated nerve conspicuity for each method.
   The two denoising methods were also performed in three patients with
   peripheral neuropathies.
   Statistical Tests For healthy volunteers, calculations included SNR and
   CNRFA (computed using FA values). Coefficient of variation (CV\%) of
   CNRFA quantified within-subject reproducibility. Groups were compared
   with two-sample t-tests (significance P < 0.05; two-tailed,
   Bonferroni-corrected). Odds ratios (ORs) quantified the relative rates
   of each of three radiologists confidently identifying a nerve, per
   slice, for the four methods.
   Results ``PCA + genSD{''} yielded the highest SNR (mean(overall) = 14.83
   +/- 1.99) and tibial and common peroneal nerve CNRFA (mean(tibial) =
   3.45, mean(peroneal) = 2.34) compared to ``original{''} (P- SNR < 0.001;
   P- CNR = 0.011) and ``PCA-only{''} (P- SNR < 0.001, P- CNR < 0.001).
   ``PCA + genSD{''} had higher within-subject reproducibility (low CV\%)
   for tibial (6.04 +/- 1.98) and common peroneal nerves (8.27 +/- 2.75)
   compared to ``original{''} and ``PCA-only.{''} The mean FA was higher
   for ``original{''} than ``average{''} (P < 0.001), but did not differ
   significantly between ``average{''} and ``PCA + genSD{''} (P = 0.14).
   ``PCA + genSD{''} had higher tibial and common peroneal nerve
   conspicuity than ``PCA-only{''} (ORtibial = 2.50, P < 0.001; ORperoneal
   = 1.86, P < 0.001) and ``original{''} (ORtibial = 2.73, P < 0.001;
   ORperoneal = 2.43, P < 0.001).
   Data Conclusion PCA + genSD denoising method improved SNR, CNRFA, and
   within-subject reproducibility (CV\%) without biasing FA and nerve
   conspicuity. This technique holds promise for facilitating more
   reliable, unbiased diffusion measurements of peripheral nerves.

Title = {{Anatomical measurements correlate with individual magnetostimulation
   thresholds for kHz-range homogeneous magnetic fields}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},

Pages = {{1836-1844}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Magnetostimulation, also known as peripheral nerve stimulation
   (PNS), is the dominant safety constraint in magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) for the gradient magnetic fields that operate around 0.1-1 kHz,
   and for the homogeneous drive field in magnetic particle imaging (MPI)
   that operates around 10-150 kHz. Previous studies did not report
   correlations between anatomical measures and magnetostimulation
   thresholds for the gradient magnetic fields in MRI. In contrast, a
   strong linear correlation was shown between the thresholds and the
   inverse of body part size in MPI. Yet, the effects of other anatomical
   measures on the thresholds for the drive field remain unexplored. Here,
   we investigate the effects of fat percentage on magnetostimulation
   thresholds for kHz-range homogeneous magnetic fields such as the drive
   field in MPI, with the ultimate goal of predicting subject-specific
   thresholds based on simple anatomical measures.
   Methods Human subject experiments were performed on the upper arms of 10
   healthy male subjects (age: 26 +/- 2 yr) to determine magnetostimulation
   thresholds. Experiments were repeated three times for each subject, with
   brief resting periods between repetitions. Using a solenoidal
   magnetostimulation coil, a homogeneous magnetic field at 25 kHz with 100
   ms pulse duration was applied at 4-s intervals, while the subject
   reported stimulation via a mouse click. To determine the thresholds,
   individual subject responses were fitted to a cumulative distribution
   function modeled by a sigmoid curve. Next, anatomical images of the
   upper arms of the subjects were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner. A
   two-point Dixon method was used to obtain separate images of water and
   fat tissues, from which several anatomical measures were derived: the
   effective outer radius of the upper arm, the effective inner radius
   (i.e., the muscle radius), and fat percentage. Pearson's correlation
   coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the threshold
   and anatomical measures. This statistical analysis was repeated after
   factoring out the expected effects of body part size. An updated model
   for threshold prediction is provided, where in addition to scaling in
   proportion with the inverse of the outer radius, the threshold has an
   affine dependence on fat percentage.
   Results A strong linear correlation (r = 0.783, P < 0.008) was found
   between magnetostimulation threshold and fat percentage, and the
   correlation became stronger after factoring out the effects of outer
   radius (r = 0.839, P < 0.003). While considering body part size alone
   did not explain any significant variance in measured thresholds (P >
   0.398), the updated model that also incorporates fat percentage yielded
   substantially improved threshold predictions with R2 = 0.654 (P <
   0.001).
   Conclusions This work shows for the first time that fat percentage
   strongly correlates with magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range
   homogenous magnetic fields such as the drive field in MPI, and that the
   correlations get even stronger after factoring out the effects of body
   part size. These results have important practical implications for
   predicting subject-specific thresholds, which in turn can increase the
   performance of the drive field and improve image quality while remaining
   within the safety limits.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To evaluate if diffusion-tensor-imaging MR-Neurography (DTI-MRN)
   can detect lesions of peripheral nerves due to polyneuropathy in
   patients with type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: Ten patients with type 2 diabetes with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10
   patients with type 2 diabetes without polyneuropathy (nDPN) as well as
   20 healthy controls (HC) were included. DTI-MRN covered proximal
   (sciatic nerve) and distal regions (tibial nerve) of the lower
   extremity. Fractional-anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity (mean (MD), axial
   (AD) and radial (RD)) were calculated and compared to neuropathy
   severity. Conventional T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density data
   were obtained from a multi-echo SE sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated
   sensitivity and specificity of DTI-MRN from receiver operating
   characteristics (ROC).
   Results: The proximal and distal FA was lowest in patients with DPN
   compared with nDPN and MC (p <0.01). Likewise, proximal and distal RD
   was highest in patients with DPN (p < 0.01). MD and AD were also
   significantly different though less pronounced. ROC curve analyses of
   DTI separated nDPN and DPN with areaunder-the-curve values ranging from
   0.65 to 0.98. T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density could not
   differentiate between nDPN and DPN.
   Conclusion: DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher
   RD. These alterations are likely to reflect both proximal and distal
   nerve fiber pathology in patients with type 2 diabetes. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the discriminative power of radiomics of peripheral
   nerves at 1.5T MRI, using common entrapment neuropathies of the upper
   limb as a model system of focal nerve injury. Materials and methods
   Radiomics was retrospectively done on peripheral nerve fascicles on
   T1-weighted 1.5T MRI of 40 patients with diagnosis of mild carpal (n =
   25) and cubital tunnel (n = 15) syndrome and of 200 controls. Z-score
   normalization and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare features of
   normal and pathological peripheral nerves. Receiver operating
   characteristic analysis was performed. Results A total of n = 104
   radiomics features were computed for each patient and control.
   Significant differences between normal and pathological median and ulnar
   nerves were found in n = 23/104 features (p < 0.001). According to
   features classification, n = 5/23 features were shape-based, n = 7/23
   were first-order features, n = 11/23 features were classified as gray
   level run length matrix. Nine of the selected features showed an AUC
   higher that 0.7: minimum AUC of 0.74 (95\% CI 0.61-0.89) for sum
   variance and maximum AUC of 0.90 (95\% CI 0.82-0.99) for zone entropy.
   Conclusion Features analysis demonstrated statistically significant
   differences between normal and pathological nerve. The results suggested
   that radiomics analysis could assess the median and ulnar nerve inner
   structure changes due to the loss of the fascicular pattern, intraneural
   edema, fibrosis or fascicular alterations in mild carpal tunnel and mild
   cubital tunnel syndromes even when the nerve cross-sectional area does
   not change.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   method for efficient nerve pathways visualization DTI, particularly of
   peripheral nerves, is commonly performed in 3 T scanners. An often more
   accessible 1.5 T scanners are less likely to be chosen for DTI
   examinations due to generally lower image quality. Novel radiofrequency
   (RF) coils can help improve the signal to noise ratio in MRI and thus
   improve image quality. This study preliminary results of the feasibility
   and outcomes assessment of DTI-based tractography of the forearm nerves
   employing a novel coil design in 1.5 T scanners. The proposed scanning
   protocol includes the use of a metamaterial-inspired RF coil, a common
   DTI pulse sequence and a 3D Ti-weighted morphological reference pulse
   sequence. The protocol is tested on three healthy volunteers. Two tract
   bundles corresponding to median and ulnar nerves of the forearm are
   reliably reconstructed in all subjects. The results show that with an
   appropriate choice of RF coil and pulse sequence parameters forearm DTI
   studies can be performed in 1.5 T scanners with sufficient quality
   making such examination more accessible for clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that a
   magnetic resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   can differentiate between crush and complete transection peripheral
   nerve injuries in a rat model ex vivo. DTI measures the directionally
   dependent effect of tissue barriers on the random diffusion of water
   molecules. In ordered tissues such as nerves, this information can be
   used to reconstruct the primary direction of diffusion along fiber
   tracts, which may provide information on fiber tract continuity after
   nerve injury and surgical repair. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were
   treated with different degrees of partial transection of the sciatic
   nerve followed by immediate repair and euthanized after 1 week of
   recovery. Nerves were then harvested, fixed, and scanned with a 7 Tesla
   magnetic resonance imaging to obtain DTIand fiber tractography in each
   sample. Additional behavioral (sciatic function index, foot fault
   asymmetry) and histological (Toluidine blue staining) assessments were
   performed for validation. Results: Tractography yielded a visual
   representation of the degree of injury that correlated with behavioral
   and histological evaluations. Conclusions: DTI tractography is a
   noninvasive tool that can yield a visual representation of a partial
   nerve transection as early as 1 week after surgical repair.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic Assessment of Nerve Regeneration with Diffusion MRI in Rat
   Models of Peripheral Nerve Trauma}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Nerve regeneration after injury must occur in a timely fashion to
   restore function. Unfortunately, current methods (e.g.,
   electrophysiology) provide limited information following trauma,
   resulting in delayed management and suboptimal outcomes. Herein, we
   evaluated the ability of diffusion MRI to monitor nerve regeneration
   after injury/repair. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three
   treatment groups (sham = 21, crush = 23, cut/repair = 19) and ex vivo
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was
   performed 1-12 weeks post-surgery. Behavioral data showed a distinction
   between crush and cut/repair nerves at 4 weeks. This was consistent with
   DTI, which found that thresholds based on the ratio of radial and axial
   diffusivities (RD/AD = 0.40 +/- 0.02) and fractional anisotropy (FA =
   0.53 +/- 0.01) differentiated crush from cut/repair injuries. By the
   12th week, cut/repair nerves whose behavioral data indicated a partial
   recovery were below the RD/AD threshold (and above the FA threshold),
   while nerves that did not recover were on the opposite side of each
   threshold. Additional morphometric analysis indicated that DTI-derived
   normalized scalar indices report on axon density (RD/AD: r = -0.54, p <
   1e-3; FA: r = 0.56, p < 1e-3). Interestingly, higher-order DKI analyses
   did not improve our ability classify recovery. These findings suggest
   that DTI may provide promising biomarkers for distinguishing
   successful/unsuccessful nerve repairs and potentially identify cases
   that require reoperation.}},

Title = {{Customized Scaffold Design Based on Natural Peripheral Nerve Fascicle
   Characteristics for Biofabrication in Tissue Regeneration}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2019}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The use of a biofabrication nerve scaffold, which mimics the
   nerve microstructure, as an alternative for autologous nerve
   transplantation is a promising strategy for treating peripheral nerve
   defects. This study aimed to design a customized biofabrication scaffold
   model with the characteristics of human peripheral nerve fascicles.
   Methods. We used Micro-MRI technique to obtain different nerve
   fascicles. A full-length 28 cm tibial nerve specimen was obtained and
   was divided into 14 two-centimetre nerve segments. 3D models of the
   nerve fascicles were obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction after
   image segmentation. The central line of the nerve fascicles was fitted,
   and the aggregation of nerve fascicles was analysed quantitatively. The
   nerve scaffold was designed by simulating the clinical nerve defect and
   extracting information from the acquired nerve fascicle data; the
   scaffold design was displayed by 3D printing to verify the accuracy of
   the model. Result. The microstructure of the sciatic nerve, tibial
   nerve, and common peroneal nerve in the nerve fascicles could be
   obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction. The number of cross
   fusions of tibial nerve fascicles from proximal end to distal end
   decreased gradually. By designing the nerve graft in accordance with the
   microstructure of the nerve fascicles, the 3D printed model demonstrated
   that the two ends of the nerve defect can be well matched. Conclusion.
   The microstructure of the nerve fascicles is complicated and changeable,
   and the spatial position of each nerve fascicle and the long segment of
   the nerve fascicle aggregation show great changes at different levels.
   Under the premise of the stability of the existing imaging techniques, a
   large number of scanning nerve samples can be used to set up a
   three-dimensional database of the peripheral nerve fascicle
   microstructure, integrating the gross imaging information, and provide a
   template for the design of the downstream nerve graft model.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is increasingly being used in
   magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). The purpose of this study was to
   determine the interreader and test-retest reliability of peripheral
   nerve DTI in MRN with focus on the sciatic nerve. Methods In this
   prospective study 27 healthy volunteers each underwent 3 scans of a
   short DTI protocol on separate days consisting of a T2-weighted turbo
   spin-echo and single-shot DTI sequence of the sciatic nerve of the
   dominant leg. The DTI parameters fractional anisotropy (FA), mean
   diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD)
   were obtained after manual nerve segmentation by two independent
   readers. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of
   measurement (SEM), and Bland-Altman plots were calculated as measures
   for both interreader and test-retest agreement for all readout
   parameters. Results The mean +/- standard deviation was 0.507 +/- 0.05
   for FA, 1308.5 +/- 162.4x 10(-6)mm(2)/s for MD, 905.6 +/-
   145.4x10(-6)mm(2)/s for RD and 2114.1 +/- 219.2x 10(-6)mm(2)/s for AD.
   The SEM for FA was 0.02 for interreader and test-retest agreement, the
   SEM for MD, RD, and AD ranged between 46.2x 10(-6)mm(2)/s (RD) and 70.1x
   10(-6)mm(2)/s (AD) for interreader reliability and between 45.9x
   10(-6)mm(2)/s (RD) and 70.1x 10(-6)mm(2)/s (AD) for test-retest
   reliability. The ICC for interreader reliability of DTI parameters
   ranged between 0.81 and 0.92 and ICC for test-retest reliability between
   0.76 and 0.91. Conclusion Peripheral nerve DTI of the sciatic nerve is
   reliable and reproducible. The measures presented here may serve as
   first orientation values of measurement accuracy when interpreting
   parameters of sciatic nerve DTI.}},

Title = {{A study protocol on nerve mobilization induced diffusion tensor imaging
   values in posterior tibial nerve in healthy controls and in patients
   with diabetic neuropathy-multigroup pretest posttest design}},
Journal = {{CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Diabetic neuropathy is the commonest chronic disabling
   complication of diabetes which may lead to amputation and compromising
   patient's quality of life. It is characterized by pain, sensation loss
   associated with neural edema. Diffusion tensor imaging parameter i.e.
   fraction anisotropy determines the free water proton diffusion in the
   healthy nerve. Since the diabetes leads to altered mechanosensitivity of
   the posterior tibial nerve thereby, might interferes with the water
   molecules movement. Therefore the present clinical trial will provide
   the evidence of improving the diffusion tensor imaging in the diabetic
   neuropathy directly by targeting the nerve through nerve mobilization
   treatment.
   Methods: Participants with Type II Diabetes Mellitus induced peripheral
   neuropathy will be selected randomly on the basis of eligibility
   criteria and informed consent will be taken. Participants will be
   recruited into three groups. Group A (experimental group A) will receive
   neural mobilization technique, Group B (experimental group B) will
   receive conventional therapy and Group C (control group) will receive
   sham treatment for 3 weeks. MRI technique, Visual analogue scale and
   neuropathy specific quality of life questionnaire will be used as
   assessment tools. Assessment will be taken at baseline and post
   intervention.
   Conclusion: this clinical trial will provide the evidence of efficacy of
   nerve mobilization in determining the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   changes in the posterior tibial nerve in patients with diabetic
   neuropathy. This trial will also be the first one in itself to look at
   the treatment induced DTI changes in the peripheral nerve.}},

   accident. She underwent rehabilitative management for memory impairment
   and central pain. At 14 months after onset, she complained of severe
   weakness of her right arm, which was detected in the morning after
   sleeping (right shoulder abductor: 3/5, elbow flexor: 3/5, wrist
   extensor: 1/5, finger flexor: 1/5, and finger extensor: 1/5).
   Electromyography study for peripheral neuropathy performed at 2 weeks
   after onset of weakness showed no abnormality. On a 14-month DTT
   configuration, the integrities of the left corticospinal tract (CST),
   supplementary motor area-corticofugal tract (SMA-CFT), and dorsal
   premotor cortex (dPMC)-CFT were well-preserved. Significant differences
   were not observed for the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity
   (MD), and tract volume (TV) values of the CST, SMA-CFT, and dPMC-CFT in
   both hemispheres between the patient and ten right-handed age- and
   sex-matched normal subjects (p > 0.05). On a 14-month TMS study, MEPs
   obtained at the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle showed no
   abnormality. Using DTT and TMS, conversion disorder was demonstrated in
   a patient with mild TBI, who showed severe weakness of an arm. Our
   results suggest the usefulness of an evaluation of the CST and CFTs from
   the secondary motor areas using DTT, and the CST using TMS for patients
   who complain of motor weakness due to conversion disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Peripheral neuropathies are a group of disorders which affect
   the peripheral nervous system which have been conventionally diagnosed
   using electrodiagnostic studies. This study was carried out to assess
   the role of imaging in diagnosing peripheral mononeuropathy as exact
   anatomical localisation of the pathology is possible using
   high-resolution ultrasound and MR neurography, the modalities assessed
   in this study. Method A hospital-based prospective analytical study was
   carried out in a resource-limited setting on 180 peripheral nerves in
   131 patients with symptoms of peripheral mononeuropathy after taking IRB
   approval. Each patient underwent high-resolution ultrasound examination
   and MR neurography, findings of which were then compared and
   statistically analysed assuming electrodiagnostic findings as the gold
   standard. Results Overall, the diagnostic accuracy was highest for the
   proton density fat-saturated MR sequence (93.89\%) followed by
   high-resolution ultrasound (80\%). The sensitivity was highest for
   proton density fat-saturated sequence while the T1 MR sequence had the
   highest specificity. Combined diagnostic accuracy of both modalities was
   calculated to be 93.33\% with a negative predictive value of 80\%.
   High-resolution ultrasound and MRI equally detected the cases with nerve
   discontinuity, while neuromas were better identified on MRI. Conclusion
   With the advent of higher frequency probes and improved MR field
   strength, imaging of peripheral nerves is possible with better accuracy.
   Imaging assessment of nerves allows anatomical delineation with
   identification of exact site of involvement. This comparative study
   demonstrates the role of imaging in diagnosing peripheral nerve
   pathologies with the accuracy of MRI as high as 93.89\% which may serve
   as an imaging gold standard. High-resolution ultrasound, being quicker,
   cost effective and a comparable accuracy of 80\% can serve as a reliable
   screening tool. This study incorporates a larger study group and
   compares HRUS with MRI, taking NCV as gold standard, which has not been
   done in the preceding studies. With this study, we conclude that these
   two imaging modalities are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they
   complement each other and can be used in conjunction as an imaging
   yardstick for diagnosing peripheral neuropathies.}},

Abstract = {{Electroacupuncture (EA) is an adjuvant therapy for peripheral nerve
   injury (PNI). Both peripheral and central alterations contribute to the
   rehabilitation process. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to
   investigate the diffusion plasticity of afferent and efferent pathways
   caused by EA in model of peripheral nerve injury and reparation.
   Twenty-four rats were divided into three groups: normal group, model
   group and intervention group. Rats of the model group and the
   intervention group underwent sciatic nerve transection and anastomosis.
   EA intervention was performed on the intervention group at ST36 and
   GB-30 for three months. Gait assessment and DTI were conducted at days
   post-operative (DPO) 30, 60 and 90. We selected corticospinal tract,
   spinothalamic tract and internal capsule as regions of interest and
   analyzed diffusion metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial
   diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). FA values and RD values
   displayed significant differences or obvious tendency while AD values
   maintained a stable level. RD values displayed better indicative
   performance than FA in internal capsule. The intervention group
   presented significant correlation between RD values and Regularity Index
   (RI) during the intervention period. The effect of EA on peripheral
   nerve injury repairing rats appeared to be accelerated recovery process
   of sensory and motor neural pathway. We proposed that RD was a potential
   in vivo indicator for structural plasticity caused by EA and PNI. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose of review Single-organ vasculitis of the peripheral nervous
   system (PNS) is often designated nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy
   (NSVN). Several variants or subtypes have been distinguished, including
   migratory sensory neuropathy, postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy,
   diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies, skin-nerve vasculitides, and,
   arguably, neuralgic amyotrophy. NSVN often presents as nondiabetic
   lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (LRPN). This review updates
   classification, clinical features, epidemiology, and imaging of these
   disorders. Recent findings A recent study showed the annual incidence of
   LRPN in Olmstead County, Minnesota to be 4.16/100 000:2.79/100 000
   diabetic and 1.27/100 000 nondiabetic. This study was the first to
   determine the incidence or prevalence of any vasculitic neuropathy. In
   NSVN, ultrasonography shows multifocal enlargement of proximal and
   distal nerves. In neuralgic amyotrophy, MRI and ultrasound reveal
   multifocal enlargements and focal constrictions in nerves derived from
   the brachial plexus. Histopathology of these chronic lesions shows
   inflammation and rare vasculitis. Diffusion tensor imaging of tibial
   nerves in NSVN revealed decreased fractional anisotropy in one study.
   Single-organ PNS vasculitides are the most common inflammatory
   neuropathies. Neuralgic amyotrophy might result from PNS vasculitis, but
   further study is necessary. The usefulness of focal nerve enlargements
   or constrictions in understanding pathological mechanisms, directing
   biopsies, and monitoring disease activity in NSVN should be further
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of Review Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being
   increasingly used as a problem-solving tool for diagnosis and management
   of peripheral neuropathies. This review is aimed at summarizing
   important technological advances, including MR pulse sequence and
   surface coil developments, which have facilitated MRN's use in clinical
   practice. Recent Findings The most recent research in MRN focuses on its
   clinical applications, with concomitant development of
   three-dimensional, parallel imaging and vascular suppression techniques
   that facilitate higher spatial resolution and depiction of small nerve
   branches arising from the brachial and lumbosacral plexi as well as
   fascicular abnormalities of more distal extremity nerves. Quantitative
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been studied as a tool to detect
   microstructural abnormalities of peripheral nerves and more precisely
   define grades of nerve injury but will require additional investigation
   to determine its role in daily clinical practice. MRN continues to
   evolve due to technological improvements and awareness by the medical
   community of its capabilities. Additional technological developments
   related to surface coil designs and vascular suppression techniques will
   be needed to move the field forward.}},

   Injury Models Reveals an Age-Related Impairment of Nerve Regeneration}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Assessment of myelin integrity in peripheral nerve injuries and
   pathologies has largely been limited to post-mortem analysis owing to
   the difficulty in obtaining biopsies without affecting nerve function.
   This is further encumbered by the small size of the tissue and its
   location. Therefore, the development of robust, non-invasive methods is
   highly attractive. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) techniques, including magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), to
   longitudinally and non-invasively characterize both the sciatic nerve
   crush and lysolecithin (LCP) demyelination models of peripheral nerve
   injury in rodents. Electrophysiological, gene expression and
   histological assessments complemented the extensive MRI analyses in
   young and aged animals. In the nerve crush model, MTR analysis indicated
   a slower recovery in regions distal to the site of injury in aged
   animals, as well as incomplete recovery at six weeks post-crush when
   analyzing across the entire nerve surface. Similar regional impairments
   were also found in the LCP demyelination model. This research underlines
   the power of MTR for the study of peripheral nerve injury in small
   tissues such as the sciatic nerve of rodents and contributes new
   knowledge to the effect of aging on recovery after injury. A particular
   advantage of the approach is the translational potential to human
   neuropathies.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established tool in
   probing cortical plasticity in vivo. Changes in corticomotor
   excitability can be induced using paired associative stimulation (PAS)
   protocol, in which TMS over the primary motor cortex is conditioned with
   an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the contralateral hand.
   PAS with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms induces long-term
   potentiation (LTP)-like effects in cortical excitability. However, the
   response to a PAS protocol tends to vary substantially across
   individuals. In this study, we used univariate and multivariate
   data-driven methods to investigate various previously proposed
   determinants of inter-individual variability in PAS efficacy, such as
   demographic, cognitive, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging
   measures. Forty-one right-handed participants, comprising 22 patients
   with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 19 healthy controls
   (HC), underwent the PAS protocol. Prior to stimulation, demographic,
   genetic, clinical, as well as structural and resting-state functional
   MRI data were acquired. The two groups did not differ in any of the
   variables, except by global cognitive status. Univariate analysis showed
   that only 61\% of all participants were classified as PAS responders,
   irrespective of group membership. Higher PAS response was associated
   with lower TMS intensity and with higher resting-state connectivity
   within the sensorimotor network, but only in responders, as opposed to
   non-responders. We also found an overall positive correlation between
   PAS response and structural connectivity within the corticospinal tract,
   which did not differ between groups. A multivariate random forest (RF)
   model identified age, gender, education, 10, global cognitive status,
   sleep quality, alertness, TMS intensity, genetic factors, and
   neuroimaging measures (functional and structural connectivity, gray
   matter (GM) volume, and cortical thickness as poor predictors of PAS
   response. The model resulted in low accuracy of the RF classifier (58\%;
   95\% CI: 42 - 74\%), with a higher relative importance of brain
   connectivity measures compared to the other variables. We conclude that
   PAS variability in our sample was not well explained by factors known to
   influence PAS efficacy, emphasizing the need for future replication
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To characterize and quantify peripheral nerve lesions and muscle
   degeneration in clinically, genetically, and electrophysiologically
   well-classified, nonpediatric patients with 5q-linked spinal muscular
   atrophy (SMA) by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN).
   Methods
   Thirty-one adult patients with genetically confirmed 5q-linked SMA types
   II, IIIa, and IIIb and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were
   prospectively investigated. All patients received neurologic,
   physiotherapeutic, and electrophysiologic assessments. MRN at 3.0T with
   anatomic coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to
   the tibiotalar joint was performed with dual-echo 2D relaxometry
   sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3D T2-weighted inversion
   recovery sequence. Detailed quantification of nerve injury by
   morphometric and microstructural MRN markers and qualitative
   classification of fatty muscle degeneration were conducted.
   Results
   Established clinical scores and compound muscle action potentials
   discriminated well between the 3 SMA types. MRN revealed that peroneal
   and tibial nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) at the thigh and lower leg
   level as well as spinal nerve CSA were markedly decreased throughout all
   3 groups, indicating severe generalized peripheral nerve atrophy. While
   peroneal and tibial nerve T2 relaxation time was distinctly increased at
   all analyzed anatomic regions, the proton spin density was clearly
   decreased. Marked differences in fatty muscle degeneration were found
   between the 3 groups and for all analyzed compartments.
   Conclusions
   MRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve involvement in SMA types II,
   IIIa, and IIIb with high sensitivity in vivo. Quantitative MRN
   parameters (T2 relaxation time, proton spin density, CSA) might serve as
   novel imaging biomarkers in SMA to indicate early microstructural nerve
   tissue changes in response to treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aims to provide normal reference values for
   quantitative parameters for brachial and lumbosacral plexi on multimodal
   MRI. In addition, the parameter variations between the left and right
   sides, the individual nerve groups, genders and age groups were also
   evaluated.
   Materials and methods: Multimodal MRI was evaluated in 163 healthy
   subjects, who were randomly divided into three groups: brachial plexus,
   lumbosacral plexus and diffusion tensor imaging groups. Nerve diameters,
   contrast ratios, T2 nerve-muscle signal ratios (nT2), fractional
   anisotropy (FA) values and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were
   measured in both plexi. Parametric tests and Pearson correlation for
   normally distributed data, and non-parametric tests and Spearman
   correlation for non-normally distributed data were used.
   Results: There were no significant differences in parameters between the
   left and right sides. The diameters of the C7, L4-S1, sciatic, and
   femoral nerve roots were larger in men than in women (P < 0.05). The nT2
   in the brachial and lumbosacral plexi and the contrast ratio in the
   lumbosacral plexus were significantly higher in the elderly. The
   diameter of the S1 nerve root was smaller in the elderly. There were no
   significant differences between the individual nerve groups in contrast
   ratios and in brachial plexus nT2. A gradual increase in the nT2 from
   the top to the bottom was observed in the L4-S1 nerve roots (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: This study provides multi-parameter normative data for the
   brachial and lumbosacral plexi while considering differences between the
   two sides, the individual nerves, genders, and the ages.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) account for 5\% of soft tissue
   neoplasms and are responsible for a wide spectrum of morbidities ranging
   from localized neuropathy to fulminant metastatic spread and death. MR
   imaging represents the gold standard for identification of these
   neoplasms, however, current anatomic MR imaging markers do not reliably
   detect or differentiate benign and malignant lesions, and therefore,
   biopsy or excision is required for definitive diagnosis.
   Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) serves as a useful tool in the
   evaluation and management of PNSTs by providing functional information
   regarding the degree of diffusion, while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   aids in determining the directional information of predominant diffusion
   and has been shown to be particularly useful for pre-operative planning
   of these tumors by delineating healthy and pathologic fascicles. The
   article focuses on these important neurogenic lesions, highlighting the
   current utility of diffusion MR imaging and future directions including
   computerized radiomic analysis.Key Points center dot Anatomic MRI is
   moderately accurate in differentiating benign from malignant PNST.center

Abstract = {{PurposeTo examine dorsal root ganglia and proximal nerve segments in
   patients carrying the Fabry-related GLA-gene variant p.D313Y in
   comparison to patients with classical Fabry mutations and healthy
   controls by morphometric and functional magnetic resonance
   neurography.MethodsThis prospective multicenter study examines the
   lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve in 11 female p.D313Y
   patients by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at
   3T. Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3 to S2, permeability of dorsal root
   ganglia L5 and S1, and spinal nerve L5 as well as cross-sectional area
   of the sciatic nerve were assessed and compared to 10 females carrying a
   classical Fabry mutation and 16healthy female controls.ResultsCompared
   to healthy controls, dorsal root ganglia volumes of p.D313Y females were
   enlarged by 53\% (L3), 48\% (L4), 43\% (L5), 57\% (S1)(p < 0.001), and
   55\% (S2) (p<0.05), but less pronounced compared to females carrying a
   classical Fabry mutation. Compared to healthy controls, p.D313Y patients
   showed no changes of dorsal root ganglia vascular permeability, while
   patients with a classical Fabry mutation showed a distinct decrease
   (p<0.05). Sciatic nerve cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6\%
   in p.D313Y as well as in classical Fabry patients
   (p<0.05).ConclusionsPatients carrying the GLA-gene variant p.D313Y show
   distinctly enlarged dorsal root ganglia, while vascular permeability
   remains within normal limits. Overall, these alterations partially share
   characteristics commonly seen in patients with a mutation causing
   classical FD. This suggests that p.D313Y causes a potentially treatable
   condition resembling an early stage of Fabry disease.}},

Title = {{Association of Serum Cholesterol Levels With Peripheral Nerve Damage in
   Patients With Type 2 Diabetes}},
Journal = {{JAMA NETWORK OPEN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Lowering serum cholesterol levels is a well-established
   treatment for dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
   However, nerve lesions in patients with T2D increase with lower serum
   cholesterol levels, suggesting that lowering serum cholesterol levels is
   associated with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in patients with T2D.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate whether there is an association between serum
   cholesterol levels and peripheral nerve lesions in patients with T2D
   with and without DPN.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center, cross-sectional,
   prospective cohort study was performed from June 1, 2015, to March 31,
   2018. Observers were blinded to clinical data. A total of 256
   participants were approached, of whom 156 were excluded. A total of 100
   participants consented to undergo magnetic resonance neurography of the
   right leg at the Department of Neuroradiology and clinical, serologic,
   and electrophysiologic assessment at the Department of Endocrinology,
   Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.
   EXPOSURES Quantification of the nerve's diameter and lipid equivalent
   lesion (LEL) load with a subsequent analysis of all acquired clinical
   and serologic data with use of 3.0-Tmagnetic resonance neurography of
   the right leg with 3-dimensional reconstruction of the sciatic nerve.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was lesion load and
   extension. Secondary outcomes were clinical, serologic, and
   electrophysiologic findings.
   RESULTS A total of 100 participants with T2D (mean {[}SD] age, 64.6
   {[}0.9] years; 68 {[}68.0\%] male) participated in the study. The LEL
   load correlated positively with the nerve's mean cross-sectional area
   (r=0.44; P <.001) and the maximum length of a lesion (r=0.71; P <.001).
   The LEL load was negatively associated with total serum cholesterol
   level (r=-0.41; P <.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level
   (r=-0.30; P=.006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r=-0.33;
   P=.003), nerve conduction velocities of the tibial (r=-0.33; P=.01) and
   peroneal (r=-0.51; P <.001) nerves, and nerve conduction amplitudes of
   the tibial (r=-0.31; P=.02) and peroneal (r=-0.28; P=.03) nerves.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings suggest that lowering serum
   cholesterol levels in patients with T2D and DPN is associated with a
   higher amount of nerve lesions and declining nerve conduction velocities
   and amplitudes. These findings may be relevant to emerging therapies
   that promote an aggressive lowering of serum cholesterol levels in
   patients with T2D.}},

   < SUV < 3.5). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from the MR,
   PET, and CT data and compared for statistical differences. Intensity
   histogram features included (mean, media, maximum, variance, full width
   at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and skewness), while image texture
   was quantified using Law's texture energy measures, grey-level
   co-occurrence matrices, and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices.
   Results. - For each of the 20 NF1 subjects, a total of 320 features were
   extracted from the image data. Feature reduction and statistical testing
   identified 9 independent radiomic biomarkers from the MR data (4
   intensity and 5 texture) and 4 PET (2 intensity and 2 texture) were
   different between the. PET-hot versus PET-elevated volumes of interest.
   Conclusions. - Our data suggests imaging features can be used to
   distinguish malignancy in NF1-realted tumors, which could improve MPNST
   risk assessment and positively impact clinical management of NF1
   patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background The development of a noninvasive, objective, and accurate
   method to assess peripheral nerve disorders in Guillain-Barre syndrome
   (GBS) is of clinical significance. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has
   been used to evaluate some peripheral nerve disorders. Purpose To
   investigate the feasibility of DTI in evaluating the peripheral nerve
   disorders in patients with GBS. Study Type Case control. Subjects Twenty
   GBS patients and 16 healthy volunteers. Field Strength/Sequence 3.0T,
   T1WI-SE, T2WI-SPAIR, DTI; electrophysiology. Assessment MRI data were
   analyzed by two radiologists blindly and independently. Fractional
   anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusion
   coefficient (AD), and radial diffusion coefficient (RD) values of tibial
   nerve (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were recorded. Motor nerve
   conduction velocity (MCV) and motor nerve conduction amplitude of TN and
   CPN were recorded. Statistical Tests Intraclass correlation coefficient
   (ICC), t-test, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), and area under
   the curve (AUC) analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient. Results The
   FA and AD values of TN and CPN in the GBS group were significantly lower
   and the ADC and RD values were higher than those in the controls (P
   <0.05). The AUC of the FA values (0.970 for TN and 0.927 for CPN) were
   higher than that of the ADC, AD, and RD values. FA and AD values were
   positively correlated and ADC, RD values were negatively correlated with
   MCV and motor nerve conduction amplitude, respectively (P <0.05). The
   correlations between FA value and electrophysiology parameters were the
   highest. Data Conclusion DTI quantitative parameters could evaluate the
   disorders of peripheral nerves in patients with GBS. A moderate
   correlation was observed between DTI and electrophysiology parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose:Hinman syndrome is a rare disease with urodynamic findings and a
   clinical course resembling neuropathic bladder, without a neuropathic
   etiology. Diffusion tensor imaging is a special technique of magnetic
   resonance imaging that has recently been used to evaluate the peripheral
   nerves but has been demonstrated to be applicable for evaluation of the
   lumbosacral plexus. We examined the lumbosacral plexus using diffusion
   tensor imaging, which has not previously been reported in patients with
   Hinman syndrome.Materials and Methods:The study included 12 patients who
   fulfilled criteria for Hinman syndrome, with severe bladder dysfunction
   on urodynamics, renal scarring on scintigraphy and no pathological
   findings on magnetic resonance imaging. The 12 subjects serving as
   controls required pelvic or spinal magnetic resonance imaging for
   reasons other than spinal abnormalities. Evaluation was performed with a
   3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system and 16-channel body coil.
   Tractography was done to examine the lumbosacral plexus. Fractional
   anisotropy and mean diffusivity were computed and compared between
   groups for the right and left plexuses.Results:Mean fractional
   anisotropy was 0.24 and 0.35 for the right plexus in patients and
   controls, respectively, and 0.24 and 0.36 for the left plexus. Mean
   diffusivity was 1.39 for the right and left plexuses in patients, and
   1.28 for the right and left plexuses in controls (p <0.001 for
   all).Conclusions:Our study focusing on the lumbosacral plexus as a
   possible origin of neuropathy revealed abnormal findings in patients
   with Hinman syndrome resembling nerve injury series. This is the first
   known study to provide data showing that Hinman syndrome may have a
   neuropathic etiology.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundDiagnosis and disease monitoring of non-systemic vasculitic
   neuropathy (NSVN) are based on electrophysiological and clinical
   measures. However, these methods are insensitive to detect subtle

   controls were investigated in this single-center prospective study. All
   participants were assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the
   tibial nerve and multiecho Dixon MRI of soleus and gastrocnemius
   muscles. These data were correlated with clinical and
   electrophysiological data.ResultsDTI scans of the tibial nerves of
   patients with NSVN showed significantly lower mean fractional anisotropy
   (FA) values (0.320.02) compared to healthy controls (0.42 +/- 0.01). FA
   values of NSVN patients correlated negatively with clinical measures of
   pain. Multiecho Dixon MRI scans revealed significantly higher
   intramuscular fat fractions in the soleus muscle (19.86 +/- 6.18\% vs.

Abstract = {{Background We sought to determine the value of diffusion-weighted (DW)
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for characterization of benign and
   malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) in patients with
   neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
   Methods Twenty-six patients with NF1 and suspicion of malignant
   transformation of PNSTs were prospectively enrolled and underwent DW MRI
   at 3T. For a set of benign (n = 55) and malignant (n = 12) PNSTs,
   functional MRI parameters were derived from both biexponential
   intravoxel incoherent motion (diffusion coefficient D and perfusion
   fraction f) and monoexponential data analysis (apparent diffusion
   coefficients {[}ADCs]). A panel of morphological MRI features was
   evaluated using T1- and T2-weighted imaging. Mann-Whitney U-test,
   Fisher's exact test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   analyses were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative
   and qualitative MRI. Cohen's kappa was used to determine interrater
   reliability.
   Results Malignant PNSTs demonstrated significantly lower diffusivity (P
   < 0.0001) compared with benign PNSTs. The perfusion fraction f was
   significantly higher in malignant PNSTs (P < 0.001). In ROC analysis,
   functional MRI parameters showed high diagnostic accuracy for
   differentiation of PNSTs (eg, ADC(mean,) 92\% sensitivity with 98\%
   specificity, AUC 0.98; D-mean,D- 92\% sensitivity with 98\% specificity,
   AUC 0.98). By contrast, morphological imaging features had only limited
   sensitivity (18-94\%) and specificity (18-82\%) for identification of
   malignancy. Interrater reliability was higher for monoexponential data
   analysis.
   Conclusion DW imaging shows better diagnostic performance than
   morphological features and allows accurate differentiation of benign and
   malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries has classically been
   based on clinical and electrophysiologic criteria. US and MRI have been
   widely used for morphologic assessment of nerve injury sites and
   concomitant lesions. In the past few years, morphologic MR neurography
   has significantly increased its clinical applications on the basis of
   three-dimensional or two-dimensional images with and without
   fat-suppression techniques. However, these sequences have a major
   drawback: absence of pathophysiologic information about functional
   integrity or axonal flow of peripheral nerves. In this scenario,
   functional MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used as a complementary tool in
   initial evaluation of peripheral nerve trauma or in assessment of trauma
   undergoing surgical repair. These approaches provide not only
   morphologic but also functional information about extent and degree of
   nerve impairment. Functional MR neurography can also be applied to
   selection, planning, and monitoring of surgical procedures that can be
   performed after traumatic peripheral nerve injuries, such as
   neurorrhaphy, nerve graft, or neurolysis, as it provides surgeons with
   valuable information about the functional status of the nerves involved
   and axonal flow integrity. The physical basis of DWI and DTI and the
   technical adjustments required for their appropriate performance for
   peripheral nerve evaluation are reviewed. Also, the clinical value of
   DWI and DTI in assessment of peripheral nerve trauma is discussed,
   enhancing their potential impact on selection, planning, and monitoring
   of surgical procedures employed for peripheral nerve repair.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo establish normal values and to identify demographic
   determinants of quantitative biomarkers in magnetic resonance
   neurography (MRN).MethodsIn this study 60healthy individuals (5men and
   5women of every decade between20 and 80years) were examined according to
   astandardized MRN protocol at 3T, including multiecho T2 relaxometry.
   Nerve cross-sectional area (CSA), transverse relaxation time (T2), and
   proton spin density (PSD) were assessed for the sciatic, tibial, median,
   ulnar, and radial nerves. Correlation with demographic variables, such
   as height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and age was expressed by
   Pearson coefficients and t-tests were used to compare MRN biomarkers
   between men and women with and without normalization to body weight and
   BMI by linear regression.ResultsThe average nerve CSA correlated
   moderately with height (r= 0.28, p= 0.04), weight (r= 0.40, p= 0.002),
   and BMI (r= 0.35, p= 0.008), but not with age (r= 0.23, p= 0.09). While
   T2 did not correlate with demographic parameters, PSD was strongly
   inversely associated with BMI (r= -0.64, p< 0.001) and weight (r=
   -0.557, p< 0.001). Sex-dependent differences in imaging marker values
   were found for CSA but became negligible after normalization to body
   weight.ConclusionQuantitative biomarkers of MRN co-vary with demographic
   variables. As particularly important determinants, we identified body
   weight for nerve CSA and BMI for PSD. The presented normal values and
   demographic determinants may assist investigations into the potential of
   MRN biomarkers in further disease-specific studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Peripheral nerve injury is often followed by a highly
   variable recovery process with respect to both rapidity and efficacy.
   Identifying post-nerve injury phenomena is key to assessing the merit
   and timing of surgery as well as to tracking nerve recovery
   postoperatively. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has been investigated in
   the clinical and research settings as a noninvasive technique to both
   assess and monitor each patient's unique case of peripheral nerve
   damage.
   New method: We identify a MRI-suitable marker for tracking the exact
   site of either nerve injury or coaptation following surgical repair to
   aid with DTI analysis.
   Results: Due to artefact and disruption of tractography, silver wire and
   microvascular clips were not suitable markers. AxoGuard (R), 4-0 vicryl
   suture, and 10-0 polyamide suture, although detectable, did not produce
   a signal easily distinguished from post-surgical changes. Silicone was
   easily identifiable and stable in both the acute and delayed time
   points, exhibited negligible impact on DTI parameters, and possessed
   geometry to prevent nerve strangulation.
   Comparison with existing method: Prior studies have not assessed the
   efficacy of other markers nor have they assessed silicone for potential
   artefact with DTI parameter analysis. Furthermore, this work
   demonstrates the reliability and compatibility of silicone in the
   delayed postoperative time period and includes its unique imaging
   appearance on high-resolution 11.7 MRI.
   Conclusion: Semi-cylindrical silicone tubing can be used as a safe,
   reliable, and readily available radiological marker to visualize and
   monitor a region of interest on a rodent's peripheral nerve for aiding
   assessments with diffusion tensor imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is seen in up
   to 75\% of treated cancer patients and can drastically limit their
   medical management and affect quality of life. Clinical and
   electrodiagnostic testing for CIPN have many pitfalls. Magnetic
   resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used in the evaluation
   of peripheral nerves. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows promise in
   the workup of peripheral nerves. In this prospective pilot study, we
   investigated a possible relationship between DTI and peripheral
   neuropathy of the ankle and foot in cancer patients treated with
   chemotherapy.
   Methods: Nine cancer patients with and without CIPN were clinically
   evaluated using vibratory perception threshold (VPT) testing. VPT score
   of > 25 Volts defined presence of CIPN. The posterior tibial nerve and
   branches in both feet were imaged using MRN and DTI. Fractional
   anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were
   measured at the posterior tibial, medial plantar, and lateral plantar
   nerves. Measurements for the CIPN group were compared to without CIPN by
   VPT cutoff. Correlations and possible relationships between DTI
   parameters and CIPN were analyzed.
   Results: A total of 16 feet of 9 enrolled patients were imaged (9 feet
   with CIPN and 7 feet without CIPN). Average age was 60.6 +/- 13.4 years
   (range: 33-74). Posterior tibial nerve ADC values were significantly
   lower than the medial plantar nerve ADC values in all feet (F = 3.50, P
   = 0.04). We found a correlation with FA and ADC values at specific nerve
   locations with CIPN, with the left medial plantar nerve FA value and
   left lateral plantar nerve ADC value demonstrating the strongest
   positive correlations (0.73 and 0.62, respectively).
   Conclusions: The use of DTI for assessing CIPN is challenging but
   promising. This pilot study provides preliminary data showing
   correlations between FA and ADC measurements with CIPN and potential
   utility of DTI as a predictive marker of onset and severity of CIPN in
   the ankle and foot, which could aid in preventive strategies. Larger,
   prospective DTI studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions. (C)

Title = {{Axons morphometry in the human spinal cord}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Pages = {{119-128}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Due to the technical challenges of large-scale microscopy and analysis,
   to date only limited knowledge has been made available about axon
   morphometry (diameter, shape, myelin thickness, volume fraction),
   thereby limiting our understanding of neuronal microstructure and
   slowing down research on neurodegenerative pathologies. This study
   addresses this knowledge gap by establishing a state-of-the-art
   acquisition and analysis framework for mapping axon morphometry, and
   providing the first comprehensive mapping of axon morphometry in the
   human spinal cord.
   We dissected, fixed and stained a human spinal cord with osmium
   tetroxide, and used a scanning electron microscope to image the entirety
   of 23 axial slices, covering C1 to L5 spinal levels. An automatic method
   based on deep learning was then used to segment each axon and myelin
   sheath to produce maps of axon morphometry. These maps were then
   registered to a standard spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   template.
   Between 500,000 (lumbar) and 1 million (cervical) myelinated axons were
   segmented at each level of this human spinal cord. Morphometric features
   show a large disparity between tracts, but high right-left symmetry. Our
   results suggest a modality-based organization of the dorsal column in
   the human, as it has been observed in the rat. The generated axon
   morphometry template is publicly available at https://osf.io/8k7jr/ and
   could be used as a reference for quantitative MRI studies. The proposed
   framework for axon morphometry mapping could be extended to other parts
   of the central or peripheral nervous system that exhibit
   coherently-oriented axons.}},

Abstract = {{Volumetric image segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
   encounters several challenges, which are specific to medical images.
   Among these challenges are large volumes of interest, high class
   imbalances, and difficulties in learning shape representations. To
   tackle these challenges, we propose to improve over traditional
   CNN-based volumetric image segmentation through point-wise
   classification of point clouds. The sparsity of point clouds allows
   processing of entire image volumes, balancing highly imbalanced
   segmentation problems, and explicitly learning an anatomical shape. We
   build upon PointCNN, a neural network proposed to process point clouds,
   and propose here to jointly encode shape and volumetric information
   within the point cloud in a compact and computationally effective
   manner. We demonstrate how this approach can then be used to refine
   CNN-based segmentation, which yields significantly improved results in
   our experiments on the difficult task of peripheral nerve segmentation
   from magnetic resonance neurography images. By synthetic experiments, we
   further show the capability of our approach in learning an explicit
   anatomical shape representation.}},

Title = {{Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spinal cord in spinal

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{24}},
Abstract = {{Objective: In this study we investigated the potential value of magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in
   characterizing changes in the cervical spinal cord and peripheral nerve
   roots in vivo in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
   Methods: We developed an MRI protocol with 4 sequences to investigate
   the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots on a 3 Tesla MRI system. We
   used 2 anatomical MRI sequences to investigate cross-sectional area
   (CSA) at each spinal segment and the diameter of ventral and dorsal
   nerve roots, and two diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques to
   estimate the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and
   radial diffusivity (RD) in 10 SMA patients and 20 healthy controls.
   Results: There were no significant differences in CSA (p > .1), although
   an 8.5\% reduction of CSA in patients compared to healthy controls was
   apparent at segment C7. DTI data showed a higher AD in grey matter of
   patients compared to healthy controls (p = .033). Significantly lower
   MD, AD and RD values were found in rostral nerve roots (C3-05) in
   patients (p < .045).
   Conclusions: We showed feasibility of an advanced 3 T MRI protocol that
   allowed differences to be determined between patients and healthy
   controls, confirming the potential of this technique to assess
   pathological mechanisms in SMA. After further development and
   confirmation of findings in a larger sample, these techniques may be
   used to study disease course of SMA in vivo and evaluate response to
   survival motor neuron (SMN) augmenting therapy.}},

   the ventral roots of the nerves C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 in the neck. The
   in vivo and in vitro evaluation of axons of the peripheral nervous
   system is performed using different techniques. Recently, many studies
   describing the application of fiber tractography and stereological axon
   number estimation to peripheral nerves have been published. Methods
   Various quantitative parameters of nerve fibers, including axon number,
   density, axonal area, and myelin thickness, can be estimated using
   stereological techniques. In vivo three-dimensional reconstruction of
   axons of BP can be visualized using a combined technique of diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tracking with the potential to evaluate
   nerve fiber content. Conclusion It is concluded that terminal branches
   of BP can be successfully visualized using DTI, which is a highly
   reproducible method for the evaluation of BP as it shows anatomical and
   functional features of neural structures. We believe that quantitative
   morphological findings obtained from BP will be useful for new
   experimental, developmental, and pathological studies in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Schwannomatosis is a distinct syndrome characterized by multiple
   peripheral nerve schwannomas that can be sporadic or familial in nature.
   Cases affecting the lower cranial nerves are infrequent. Here, the

   accessory nerve. Upon genetic screening, an in-frame insertion at codon
   p.R177 of the Sox 10 gene was observed. There were no identifiable
   alterations in NF1, NF2, LZTR1, and SMARCB1. This case demonstrates a

Abstract = {{Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) adds functional information to
   morphological magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in the assessment of
   the brachial nerve plexus. To determine the most appropriate pulse
   sequence in scan times suited for diagnostic imaging in clinical
   routine, we compared image quality between simultaneous multi-slice
   readout-segmented (rs-DTI) and conventional single-shot (ss-DTI)
   echo-planar imaging techniques.
   Methods: Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved study including 10
   healthy volunteers. The supraclavicular brachial plexus, covering the
   nerve roots and trunks from C5 to C7, was imaged on both sides with
   rs-DTI and ss-DTI. Both sequences were acquired in scan times <7 min
   with b-values of 900 s/mm(2) and with isotropic spatial resolution.
   Results: In rs-DTI image, the overall quality was significantly better
   and distortion artifacts were significantly lower (P = 0.001-0.002 and P
   = 0.001-0.002, respectively) for both readers. In ss-DTI, a trend toward
   lower degree of ghosting and motion artifacts was elicited (reader 1, P
   = 0.121; reader 2, P = 0.264). No significant differences between the
   two DTI techniques were found for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR),
   contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (P >=
   0.475, P >= 0.624, and P >= 0.169, respectively). Interreader agreement
   for all examined parameters and all sequences ranged from intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.064 to 0.905 and Kappa 0.40 to 0.851.
   Conclusion: Incomparable acquisition times rs-DTI showed higher image
   quality and less distortion artifacts than ss-DTI. The trend toward a
   higher degree of ghosting and motion artifacts in rs-DTI did not
   deteriorate image quality to a significant degree. Thus, rs-DTI should
   be considered for functional MRN of the brachial plexus.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: By applying diffusor tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with
   anterior interosseous nerve syndrome (AINS), this proof of principle
   study aims to quantify the extent of structural damage of a peripheral
   nerve at the anatomical level of individual fascicles.
   Methods: In this institutional review board approved prospective study
   13 patients with spontaneous AINS were examined at 3 Tesla including a
   transversal T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo and a spin-echo
   echo-planar-imaging pulse sequence of the upper arm level. Calculations
   of quantitative DTI parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA),
   mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity
   (AD) for median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles as well as ulnar
   and radial nerve were obtained. DTI values were compared to each other
   and to a previously published dataset of 58 healthy controls using
   one-way Analysis of Variance with Bonferroni correction and p-values <
   .05 were considered significant. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   curves were performed to assess diagnostic accuracy.
   Results: FA of median nerve lesion fascicles was decreased compared to
   median nerve non-lesion fascicles, ulnar nerve and radial nerve while
   MD, RD, and AD was increased (p < .001 for all parameters). Compared to
   median nerve values of healthy controls, lesion fascicles showed a
   significant decrease in FA while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p < .001
   for all parameters). FA of median nerve non-lesion fascicles showed a
   weak significant decrease compared to healthy controls (p < .01) while
   there was no difference in MD, RD, and AD. ROC analyses revealed an
   excellent diagnostic accuracy of FA, MD and RD in the discrimination of
   median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles in AINS patients as well as
   in the discrimination of lesion fascicles and normative median nerve
   values of healthy controls.
   Conclusion: By applying this functional MR Neurography technique in
   patients with AINS, this proof of principle study demonstrates that
   diffusion tensor imaging is feasible to quantify structural nerve injury
   at the anatomical level of individual fascicles.}},

   Results: The T2 relaxation times of the ganglia and roots were longer in
   patients with CIDP (119.31 +/- 35.53 msec and 111.15 +/- 33.82 msec)
   than in healthy subjects (101.42 +/- 26.42 msec and 85.29 +/- 13.22

Abstract = {{Objectives: New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on 3D
   fat-suppressed techniques provide high accuracy for evaluation of
   brachial plexus and peripheral nerve lesions from a qualitative point of
   view. However, this qualitative evaluation often demonstrates
   overlapping features among different pathologies (Pullman a al., 2013).
   Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are
   functional MRI techniques that have been successfully applied in the
   imaging of central nervous system lesions, and now are being imported,
   with promising results for peripheral nerve and plexus evaluation.
   Several derived parameters from DWI and DTI studies such as apparent
   diffusion coefficient (ADC) or fractional anisotropy (FA), can be used
   as potential biomarkers of neural damage by providing information about
   axonal flow, fiber organization or myelin integrity (Andreou a al.,
   2015). In this study we assess the role of DW and DT based quantitative
   measures in characterization of traumatic and non traumatic lesions of
   brachial plexus and peripheral nerve and its influence on therapeutic
   management and outcome.
   Methods: 34 patients with features of brachial plexopathy and peripheral
   neuropathy were included in the study. MR neurography examinations
   included conventional MR sequences and unidirectional DW-MRN with
   background suppression (DWIBS) and DTI. The images were independently
   reviewed by two radiologists and the findings were recorded at different
   levels of the brachial plexus: ganglia, roots, trunks, divisions and
   cords. Mean ADC and FA values were determined within each lesion and
   within contra lateral homologous unaffected segment of the plexus. The
   Mann-Whitney Test was used to calculate the differences in ADC\&FA
   values between diseased and normal sides and the One way ANOVA test
   between diseased segments of different pathologies with p-values < 0.05
   being considered statistically significant.
   Results: patients were classified according to etiologic causes into
   four categories: traumatic, compressive degenerative disk, radiation
   induced plexitis and neoplastic nerve compression or invasion. T2 high
   signal intensity and swelling of the affected nerve, muscular
   denervation and complication such as pseudo meningeocele and neuroma
   were the major findings in qualitatitve sequences. A statistically
   significant difference in ADC and FA values were found between diseased
   and normal sides as well as across the traumatic and non traumatic
   groups and between benign compressive and malignant infiltrative
   etiologies.
   Conclusion: The resulted values of newly designed quantitative protocols
   give us functional and numerical marker by which the diagnosis and
   differentiation of different pathologies of peripheral nerves and
   brachial plexus will be more suitable.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the development of
   morphologic and diffusion tensor imaging sequences of peripheral nerves
   at 7 T, using carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as a model system of focal
   nerve injury.
   Materials and Methods: Morphologic images were acquired at 7 T using a
   balanced steady-state free precession sequence. Diffusion tensor imaging
   was performed using single-shot echo-planar imaging and
   readout-segmented echo-planar imaging sequences. Different acquisition
   and postprocessing methods were compared to describe the optimal
   analysis pipeline. Magnetic resonance imaging parameters including
   cross-sectional areas, signal intensity, fractional anisotropy (FA), as
   well as mean, axial, and radial diffusivity were compared between
   patients with CTS (n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 6) using analyses of
   covariance corrected for age (significance set at P < 0.05). Pearson
   correlations with Bonferroni correction were used to determine
   association of magnetic resonance imaging parameters with clinical
   measures (significance set at P < 0.01).
   Results: The 7 T acquisitions with high in-plane resolution (0.2 x
   0.2mm) afforded detailed morphologic resolution of peripheral nerve
   fascicles. For diffusion tensor imaging, single-shot echo-planar imaging
   was more efficient than readout-segmented echo-planar imaging in terms
   of signal-to-noise ratio per unit scan time. Distortion artifacts were
   pronounced, but could be corrected during postprocessing. Registration
   of FA maps to the morphologic images was successful. The developed
   imaging and analysis pipeline identified lower median nerve FA (pisiform
   bone, 0.37 {[}SD 0.10]) and higher radial diffusivity (1.08 {[}0.20]) in
   patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (0.53 {[}0.06] and 0.78
   {[}0.11], respectively, P < 0.047). Fractional anisotropy and radial
   diffusivity strongly correlated with patients' symptoms (r = -0.866 and
   0.866, respectively, P = 0.005).
   Conclusions: Our data demonstrate the feasibility of morphologic and
   diffusion peripheral nerve imaging at 7 T. Fractional anisotropy and
   radial diffusivity were found to be correlates of symptom severity.}},

Abstract = {{Botulinum neurotoxin A (BTX-A) intervention has long-term benefits for
   children with obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP). Although cortical
   plasticity has been widely studied, plasticity in white matter has not
   received as much attention. Here, six children with OBPP underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) before and 6 months after BTX-A treatment. Surface
   electromyography (EMG) was recorded. The aim was to investigate changes
   in the corticospinal tract (CST) as an example longitudinal observation
   of white matter plasticity. Deterministic fiber tracking with a Fiber
   Assignment by Continuous Tracking algorithm was used to reconstruct the
   CST. Fiber tracts passing through a region of interest (ROI) in the
   posterior limb of the internal capsule and a target ROI in the
   upper-limb representation of M1 (defined by task related fMRI) were
   selected as the CST. Motor performances were improved while EMG showed
   no significant difference 6 months after the treatment. We observed a
   significant increase in mean fractional anisotropy and a significant
   decrease in fiber number after treatment. We analyzed the correlations
   between DTI metrics and clinical motor assessments. Although the
   correlation results were not statistically significant, they support the
   notion that BTX-A treatment causes white matter plasticity and has a
   positive long-term outcome. Peripheral deafferentation may lead to
   altered information flow, resulting in the positive adaptation of white
   matter. This study provides novel insight into cerebral plasticity
   following peripheral nerve regeneration and indicates that a combination
   of relatively non-invasive therapies can accelerate plasticity of
   sensorimotor circuits and promote functional recovery in OBPP.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to find accurate angles and depths of lateral ventricle
   puncture using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reconstruction, as well as
   to provide an optimized and alternative puncturing strategy.
   A total of 90 computed tomography (CT) images and 30 CT images with DTI
   were analyzed. The measurements were performed on coronal, sagittal, and
   horizontal planes. Some distances and angles were measured to determine
   the best angle and penetration depth during the puncture process.
   Important landmarks of the lateral ventricle were also measured, and a
   comparison of the differences between 2 hemispheres was also assessed.
   It showed that the vertical distance from the superior margin to
   inferior margin of the lateral ventricle was 22.2 +/- 0.5mm and the
   length was 124.1 +/- 2.1mm. In the frontal horn puncture approach, the
   penetration depth should be limited between 105.2 and 109.4 mm, the
   angle should be 71.6 +/- 2.7 degrees. During the occipital horn puncture
   approach, puncturing depth was from 90.7 to 111.4mm, and angle was 15.3
   +/- 1.8 degrees. Through the parietal lobe puncture approach, which was
   firstly brought out in this study, the puncturing length should be 124.4
   to 130.2 mm and angle was 56.6 +/- 2.0 degrees.
   The traditional recommended protocol of lateral ventricle puncture is
   not accurate, the refined lateral ventricle puncture protocol
   established in this study will reduce injury and remain function. A DTI
   imaging examination combining with nerve fibers reconstruction were
   strongly recommended before lateral ventricle puncture, which will help
   neurosurgeons to determine the best puncturing angles and depth.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine dorsal root ganglia and the proximal nerve segments
   in female patients with Fabry disease by functional and morphometric
   magnetic resonance neurography.
   Methods: In this prospective multicenter study the lumbosacral dorsal
   root ganglia and proximal sciatic nerve were examined in ten female
   patients with Fabry disease by a standardized magnetic resonance
   neurography protocol at 3T. Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3-S2,
   permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1 and the spinal nerve L5 as
   well as the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic nerve were
   compared to 16 gender-matched healthy controls.
   Results: Dorsal root ganglia were symmetrically enlarged by 54\% (L3),
   79\% (L4), 60\% (L5), 94\% (S1), and 106\% (S2) (p < 0.001).
   Additionally, permeability of the blood-tissue interface was decreased
   by 47\% (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the peripheral
   zone of the dorsal root ganglia, where the cell bodies of the primary
   sensory neurons are located (p < 0.001). While spinal nerve permeability
   showed no differences compared to healthy controls, proximal sciatic
   nerve cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6\% (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Although heterozygous, Fabry females show severe enlarged
   dorsal root ganglia with a concomitant dysfunctional perfusion, even in
   patients with minor disease progression and in patients who are not
   considered for enzyme replacement therapy yet. Alterations in dorsal
   root ganglia volume and perfusion might serve as a very early in vivo
   marker for involvement of the peripheral nervous system in Fabry
   disease, even in patients with residual enzyme activity.}},

Abstract = {{Repetitive electrical activity produces microstructural alteration in
   myelinated axons, which may afford the opportunity to non-invasively
   monitor function of myelinated fibers in peripheral nervous system
   (PNS)/CNS pathways. Microstructural changes were assessed via two
   different magnetic-resonance-based approaches: diffusion fMRI and
   dynamic T-2 spectroscopy in the ex vivo perfused bullfrog sciatic
   nerves. Using this robust, classical model as a platform for testing, we
   demonstrate that noninvasive diffusion fMRI, based on standard diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI), can clearly localize the sites of axonal
   conduction blockage as might be encountered in neurotrauma or other
   lesion types. It is also shown that the diffusion fMRI response is
   graded in proportion to the total number of electrical impulses carried
   through a given locus. Dynamic T-2 spectroscopy of the perfused frog
   nerves point to an electrical-activity-induced redistribution of tissue
   water and myelin structural changes. Diffusion basis spectrum imaging
   (DBSI) reveals a reversible shift of tissue water into a restricted
   isotropic diffusion signal component. Submyelinic vacuoles are observed
   in electron-microscopy images of tissue fixed during electrical
   stimulation. A slowing of the compound action potential conduction
   velocity accompanies repetitive electrical activity. Correlations
   between electrophysiology and MRI parameters during and immediately
   after stimulation are presented. Potential mechanisms and
   interpretations of these results are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies relies on neurological
   examinations, electrodiagnostic studies, and since recently magnetic
   resonance neurography (MRN). The aim of this study was to develop and
   evaluate a fully-automatic segmentation method of peripheral nerves of
   the thigh. T2-weighted sequences without fat suppression acquired on a 3
   T MR scanner were retrospectively analyzed in 10 healthy volunteers and
   42 patients suffering from clinically and electrophysiologically
   diagnosed sciatic neuropathy. A fully-convolutional neural network was
   developed to segment the MRN images into peripheral nerve and background
   tissues. The performance of the method was compared to manual
   inter-rater segmentation variability. The proposed method yielded Dice
   coefficients of 0.859 +/- 0.061 and 0.719 +/- 0.128, Hausdorff distances
   of 13.9 +/- 26.6 and 12.4 +/- 12.1 mm, and volumetric similarities of
   0.930 +/- 0.054 and 0.897 +/- 0.109, for the healthy volunteer and
   patient cohorts, respectively. The complete segmentation process
   requires less than one second, which is a significant decrease to manual
   segmentation with an average duration of 19 +/- 8 min. Considering
   cross-sectional area or signal intensity of the segmented nerves, focal
   and extended lesions might be detected. Such analyses could be used as
   biomarker for lesion burden, or serve as volume of interest for further
   quantitative MRN techniques. We demonstrated that fully-automatic
   segmentation of healthy and neuropathic sciatic nerves can be performed
   from standard MRN images with good accuracy and in a clinically feasible
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerves are a composite tissue consisting of neurovascular
   elements packaged within a well-organized extracellular matrix. Their
   composition, size, and anatomy render nerves a challenging medical
   imaging target. In contrast to morphological MRI, which represents the
   predominant approach to nerve imaging, quantitative MRI sequences can
   provide information regarding tissue composition. Here, we applied
   standard clinical Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) and experimental
   three-dimensional (3D) ultrashort echo time (UTE) Cones sequences for
   quantitative nerve imaging including T-2 measurement with
   single-component analysis, T-2{*} measurement with single-component and
   bi-component analyses, and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) analysis.
   We demonstrated the feasibility and the high quality of single-component
   T-2{*}, bi-component T-2{*}, and MTR approaches to analyze nerves imaged
   with clinically deployed 3D UTE Cones pulse sequences. For 24 single
   fascicles from eight nerves, we measured a mean single-component T-2{*}
   of 22.6 +/- 8.9ms, and a short T-2{*} component (STC) with a mean T-2{*}
   of 1.7 +/- 1.0ms and a mean fraction of (6.74 +/- 4.31)\% in
   bi-component analysis. For eight whole nerves, we measured a mean
   single-component T-2{*} of 16.7 +/- 2.2ms, and an STC with a mean T-2{*}
   of 3.0 +/- 1.0ms and a mean fraction of (15.56 +/- 7.07)\% in
   bi-component analysis. For nine fascicles from three healthy nerves, we
   measured a mean MTR of (25.2 +/- 1.9)\% for single fascicles and a mean
   MTR of (23.6 +/- 0.9)\% for whole nerves. No statistically significant
   correlation was observed between any MRI parameter and routine
   histological outcomes, perhaps due to the small sample size and lack of
   apparent sample pathology. Overall, we have successfully demonstrated
   the feasibility of measuring quantitative MR outcomes ex vivo, which
   might reflect features of nerve structure and macromolecular content.
   These methods should be validated comprehensively on a larger and more
   diverse set of nerve samples, towards the interpretation of in vivo
   outcomes. These approaches have new and broad implications for the
   management of nerve disease, injury, and repair.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve injuries result in severe loss of sensory and motor
   functions in the afflicted limb. There is a lack of standardised models
   to non-invasively study degeneration, regeneration, and normalisation of
   neuronal microstructure in peripheral nerves. This study aimed to
   develop a non-invasive evaluation of peripheral nerve injuries, using
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and
   tractography on a rat model of sciatic nerve injury. 10 female Sprague
   Dawley rats were exposed to sciatic nerve neurotmesis and studied using
   a 9.4 T magnet, by performing DTI and DKI of the sciatic nerve before
   and 4 weeks after injury. The distal nerve stump showed a decrease in
   fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis (MK), axonal water fraction
   (AWF), and radial and axonal kurtosis (RK, AK) after injury. The
   proximal stump showed a significant decrease in axial diffusivity (AD)
   and increase of MK and AK as compared with the uninjured nerve. Both
   mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) increased in the
   distal stump after injury. Tractography visualised the sciatic nerve and
   the site of injury, as well as local variations of the diffusion
   parameters following injury. In summary, the described method detects
   changes both proximal and distal to the nerve injury.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To detect, localize, and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in amyloid
   light chain (AL) amyloidosis by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in
   correlation with clinical and electrophysiologic findings.
   Methods
   We prospectively examined 20 patients with AL-polyneuropathy (PNP) and
   25 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers. After detailed neurologic and
   electrophysiologic testing, the patient group was subdivided into mild
   and moderate PNP. MRN in a 3.0 tesla scanner with anatomical coverage
   from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to the tibiotalar
   joint was performed by using T2-weighted and dual-echo 2-dimensional
   sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3-dimensional, T2-weighted
   inversion recovery sequence. Besides evaluation of nerve T2-weighted
   signal, detailed quantification of nerve injury by morphometric (nerve
   caliber) and microstructural MRN markers (proton spin density, T2
   relaxation time) was conducted.
   Results
   Nerve T2-weighted signal increase correlated with disease severity:
   moderate (420.2 +/- 60.1) vs mild AL-PNP (307.2 +/- 17.9; p = 0.0003) vs
   controls (207.0 +/- 6.4; p < 0.0001). Proton spin density was also
   higher in moderate (tibial: 525.5 +/- 53.0; peroneal: 553.6 +/- 64.5;
   sural: 492.0 +/- 56.6) and mild AL-PNP (tibial: 431.6 +/- 22.0;
   peroneal: 457.6 +/- 21.7; sural: 404.8 +/- 25.2) vs controls (tibial:
   310.5 +/- 14.1; peroneal: 313.6 +/- 11.6; sural: 261.7 +/- 11.0; p <
   0.0001 for all nerves). T2 relaxation time was elevated in moderate
   AL-PNP only (tibial: p = 0.0106; peroneal: p = 0.0070; sural: p =
   0.0190). Tibial nerve caliber was higher in moderate (58.0 +/- 8.8
   mm(3)) vs mild AL-PNP (46.5 +/- 2.5 mm(3); p = 0.008) vs controls (39.1
   +/- 1.2 mm(3); p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions
   MRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve injury in AL-PNP in vivo
   with high sensitivity and in close correlation with the clinical stage.
   Quantitative parameters are feasible new imaging biomarkers for the
   detection of early AL-PNP and might help to monitor microstructural
   nerve tissue changes under treatment.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo perform in vivo isotropic-resolution diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) of lumbosacral and sciatic nerves with a phase-navigated
   diffusion-prepared (DP) 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) acquisition and
   modified reconstruction incorporating intershot phase-error correction
   and to investigate the improvement on image quality and diffusion
   quantification with the proposed phase correction.
   MethodsPhase-navigated DP 3D TSE included magnitude stabilizers to
   minimize motion and eddy-current effects on the signal magnitude. Phase
   navigation of motion-induced phase errors was introduced before readout
   in 3D TSE. DTI of lower back nerves was performed in vivo using 3D TSE
   and single-shot echo planar imaging (ss-EPI) in 13 subjects. Diffusion
   data were phase-corrected per k(z) plane with respect to T-2-weighted
   data. The effects of motion-induced phase errors on DTI quantification
   was assessed for 3D TSE and compared with ss-EPI.
   ResultsNon-phase-corrected 3D TSE resulted in artifacts in
   diffusion-weighted images and overestimated DTI parameters in the
   sciatic nerve (mean diffusivity {[}MD]=2.060.45). Phase correction of 3D
   TSE DTI data resulted in reductions in all DTI parameters (MD=1.73 +/-
   0.26) of statistical significance (P0.001) and in closer agreement with
   ss-EPI DTI parameters (MD=1.62 +/- 0.21).
   ConclusionDP 3D TSE with phase correction allows distortion-free
   isotropic diffusion imaging of lower back nerves with robustness to
   motion-induced artifacts and DTI quantification errors. Magn Reson Med

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and related
   techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are uniquely sensitive
   to the microstructure of the brain and spinal cord. In the acute
   aftermath of nervous system injury, for example, DWI reveals changes
   caused by injury that remains invisible on other MRI contrasts such as
   T-2-weighted imaging. This ability has led to a demonstrated clinical
   utility in cerebral ischemia. However, despite strong promise in
   preclinical models and research settings, DWI has not been as readily
   adopted for other acute injuries such as traumatic spinal cord, brain,
   or peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the precise biophysical
   mechanisms that underlie DWI and DTI changes are not fully understood.
   In this report, we review the DWI and DTI changes that occur in acute
   neurological injury of cerebral ischemia, spinal cord injury, traumatic
   brain injury, and peripheral nerve injury. Their associations with the
   underlying biology are examined with an emphasis on the role of acute
   axon and dendrite beading. Lastly, emerging DWI techniques to overcome
   the limitations of DTI are discussed as these may offer the needed
   improvements to translate to clinical settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Magnetization transfer contrast imaging provides
   indirect information on the concentration of bound water protons and
   their interactions with free water molecules. The purpose of this study
   is to analyze location- and age-dependent changes in the magnetization
   transfer ratio (MTR) of lower extremity nerves.
   Materials and Methods: Ten younger (20-32 years) and 5 older (50-63
   years) healthy volunteers underwent magnetization transfer contrast
   imaging at 3 Tesla Two 3-dimensional gradient echo sequences with and
   without an off-resonance saturation pulse (repetition time: 58
   milliseconds; echo time: 2.46 milliseconds; band width: 530 Hz/Px; flip
   angle: alpha = 7 degrees) were acquired at 3 different locations
   covering the proximal thigh to the distal lower leg in the group of
   younger volunteers and at 2 different locations covering the proximal to
   distal thigh in the group of older volunteers. Sciatic and tibial nerve
   regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn and additional ROIs were
   placed in predetermined muscles. Magnetization transfer ratios were
   extracted from respective ROIs and calculated for each individual and
   location.
   Results: In young volunteers, mean values of nerve and muscle MTR were
   not different between the proximal thigh (nerve: 20.34 0.91; muscle:
   31.71 +/- 0.29), distal thigh (nerve: 19.90 +/- 0.98; P = 0.76; muscle:
   31.53 +/- 0.69; P = 0.87), and lower leg (nerve: 20.82 +/- 1.07; P =
   0.73; muscle: 32.44 +/- 1.11; P = 0.51). An age-dependent decrease of
   sciatic nerve MTR was observed in the group of older volunteers (16.95
   +/- 1.2) compared with the group of younger volunteers (20.12 +/- 0.65;
   P = 0.019). Differences in muscle MTR were not significant between older
   (31.01 +/- 0.49) and younger (31.62 +/- 0.37; P = 0.20) volunteers.
   Conclusion: The MTR of lower extremity nerves shows no
   proximal-to-distal gradient in young healthy volunteers but decreases
   with age. For future studies using MTR in peripheral nerve disorders,
   these findings suggest that referencing magnetization transfer contrast
   values in terms of age, but not anatomical nerve location is required.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) technique that measures the extent of restricted water
   diffusion and anisotropy in biological tissue. Although DTI has been
   widely applied in the brain, more recently researchers have used it to
   characterize nerve pathology in the setting of entrapment neuropathy,
   traumatic injury, and tumor. DTI artifacts are exacerbated when imaging
   off isocenter in the body. Anecdotally, the most significant artifacts
   in peripheral nerve DTI include magnetic field inhomogeneity, motion,
   incomplete fat suppression, aliasing, and distortion. High spatial
   resolution is also required to reliably evaluate smaller peripheral
   nerves. This article provides an overview of such technical issues,
   particularly when trying to apply DTI in the clinical setting, and
   offers potential solutions. Level of Evidence: 5 Technical Efficacy:

Abstract = {{Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of peripheral nerves may
   provide additional information about nerve involvement in muscular
   disorders, but is considered difficult due to different optimal scan
   parameters tailored to magnetic resonance (MR) signal properties of
   muscle and neural tissues.
   Purpose: To assess the feasibility of sciatic nerve DTI using two
   different approaches of region of interest (ROI)-localization in DTI
   scans with b-values 500s/mm(2), in participants with muscular disorders
   and in controls.
   Material and Methods: DTI of the thigh was conducted on a 3T system in
   ten patients (6 men, 4 women; mean age = 54 +/- 15 years) with
   neuromuscular disorders and ten controls. T1-weighted (T1W) images were
   co-registered to fractional anisotropy (FA) color-encoded images. The
   apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, and fiber track length (FTL)
   were analyzed by two operators using a freehand ROI and a single-point
   ROI covering the sciatic nerve. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
   and Bland-Altman analysis were used for evaluation of inter-operator and
   inter-technical agreement, respectively.
   Results: Three-dimensional visualization of sciatic nerve fiber was
   achievable using both techniques. The ICC of DTI metrics showed
   excellent inter-operator agreement both in patients and controls.
   Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement of both techniques. A
   maximum FTL was achieved using the single-point ROI technique, but with
   a lower inter-operator agreement (ICC = 0.99 vs. 0.83). The ADC and
   maximum FTL were significantly decreased in patients compared to
   controls.
   Conclusion: Both ROI localization techniques are feasible to analyze the
   sciatic nerve in the setting of muscular disease. A maximum FTL is
   reached using the single-point ROI, however, at the cost of lower
   inter-operator agreement.}},

Abstract = {{To identify demographic determinants of peripheral nerve diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) and to establish normal values for fractional
   anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and
   mean diffusivity (MD).
   Sixty subjects were examined at 3 Tesla by single-shot DTI. FA, AD, RD,
   and MD were collected for the sciatic, tibial, median, ulnar, and radial
   nerve and were correlated with demographic variables.
   Mean FA of all nerves declined with increasing age (r = -0.77), which
   could be explained by RD increasing (r = 0.56) and AD declining (r =
   -0.40) with age. Moreover, FA was inversely associated with height (r =
   -0.28), weight (r = -0.38) and BMI (r = -0.35). Although FA tended to be
   lower in men than women (p = 0.052), this difference became completely
   negligible after adjustment to body weight. A multiple linear regression
   model for FA was calculated with age and weight as predictors (defined
   by backward variable selection), yielding an R (2) = 0.71 and providing
   a correction formula to adjust FA for age and weight.
   Peripheral nerve DTI parameters depend on demographic variables. The
   most important determinants age and weight should be considered in all
   studies employing peripheral nerve DTI.

Abstract = {{Purpose Given no definite consensus on the accepted autograft
   orientation during peripheral nerve injury repair, we compare outcomes
   between reverse and normally oriented autografts using an advanced
   magnetic resonance imaging technique, diffusion tensor imaging.
   Methods Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3
   groups: shamleft sciatic nerve isolation without injury, reverse
   autograft10-mm cut left sciatic nerve segment reoriented 180 degrees and
   used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps, or normally oriented
   autograft10-mm cut nerve segment kept in its normal orientation for
   coaptation. Animals underwent sciatic functional index and foot fault
   behavior studies at 72 hours, and then weekly. At 6 weeks, axons
   proximal, within, and distal to the autograft were evaluated using
   diffusion tensor imaging and choline acetyltransferase motor staining
   for immunohistochemistry. Toluidine blue staining of 1-m sections was
   used to assess axon count, density, and diameter. Bilateral
   gastrocnemius/soleus muscle weights were compared to obtain a net wet
   weight. Comparison of the groups was performed using Mann-Whiney U or
   Kruskal-Wallis H tests to determine significance.
   Results Diffusion tensor imaging findings including fractional
   anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity were similar
   between reverse and normally oriented autografts. Diffusion tensor
   imaging tractography demonstrated proximodistal nerve regeneration in
   both autograft groups. Motor axon counts proximal, within, and distal to
   the autografts were similar. Likewise, axon count, density, and diameter
   were similar between the autograft groups. Muscle net weight at 6 weeks
   and behavioral outcomes (sciatic functional index and foot fault) at any
   tested time point were also similar between reverse and normally
   oriented autografts.
   Conclusions Diffusion tensor imaging may be a useful assessment tool for
   peripheral nerve regeneration. Reversing nerve autograft polarity did
   not demonstrate to have an influence on functional or regenerative
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We present a clinical, electrophysiological, sonographical
   and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) study examining the
   complementary role of two neuroimaging methods of the peripheral nervous
   system for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating
   polyneuropathy (CIDP). Furthermore, we explore the significance of
   cross-sectional area (CSA) increase through correlations with MRN
   markers of nerve integrity.
   Methods: A total of 108 nerve segments on the median, ulnar, radial,
   tibial and fibular nerve, as well as the lumbar and cervical plexus of
   18 CIDP patients were examined with high-resonance nerve ultrasound
   (HRUS) and MRN additionally to the nerve conduction studies.
   Results: We observed a fair degree of correlation of the CSA values for
   all nerves/nerve segments between the two methods, with a low random
   error in Bland-Altman analysis (bias = HRUS-CSA - MRN-CSA, -0.61 to
   -3.26 mm). CSA in HRUS correlated with the nerve T2-weighted (nT2)
   signal increase as well as with diffusion tensor imaging parameters such
   as fractional anisotropy, a marker of microstructural integrity.
   HRUS-CSA of the interscalene brachial plexus correlated significantly
   with the MRN-CSA and nT2 signal of the L5 and S1 roots of the lumbar
   plexus.
   Conclusions: HRUS allows for reliable CSA imaging of all peripheral
   nerves and the cervical plexus, and CSA correlates with markers of nerve
   integrity. Imaging of proximal segments as well as the estimation of
   nerve integrity require MRN as a complementary method.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this work is to examine the architectural
   configuration and the microstructural substrate of the cervical spine
   and its nerve roots with post-mortem (PM) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   in non-fixed subjects and to compare these findings with histology.
   Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired on a 1.5 T
   MRI scanner in five non-fixed non-trauma deaths. Two different areas
   were evaluated: 1) the cervical spinal cord and ventral and dorsal nerve
   roots with a ``high in-plane{''} DTI and a multi-echo fast field echo
   protocol, and 2) the cervical peripheral nerves with an ``isotropic{''}
   DTI and a 3D turbo spin echo protocol. Histology samples were obtained
   matching the anatomical level of the slices of the `high in-plane' DTI
   protocol.
   Results: We were able to show detailed reconstructions of the dorsal and
   ventral nerve roots with the `high inplane' protocol and identified a
   low fractional anisotropy (FA = 0.30 +/- 0.08) in the grey matter and a
   high FA (0.51 +/- 0.13) in the white matter. Both grey and white matter
   configurations correlated with the anatomical MRI, the diffusion MRI,
   and with the histological sections. Using the `isotropic' DTI protocol,
   it was feasible to reconstruct the spinal cord, cervical nerves, and
   nerve roots in all PM subjects.
   Conclusion: We were able to generate detailed architectural
   configurations of the ventral and dorsal nerve roots. Anatomical and
   diffusion MR scans showed good qualitative agreement with histology. We
   believe that PMDTI will be helpful in the assessment of head and neck
   injuries in a forensic setting.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance neurography (also called MRN or MR neurography)
   refers to MR imaging dedicated to the peripheral nerves. It is a
   technique that enhances selective multiplanar visualisation of the
   peripheral nerve and pathology by encompassing a combination of
   two-dimensional, three-dimensional and diffusion imaging pulse
   sequences. Referring physicians who seek imaging techniques that can
   depict and diagnose peripheral nerve pathologies superior to
   conventional MR imaging are driving the demand for MRN. This article
   reviews the pathophysiology of peripheral nerves in common practice
   scenarios, technical considerations of MRN, current indications of MRN,
   normal and abnormal neuromuscular appearances, and imaging pitfalls.
   Finally, the emerging utility of diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor
   imaging is discussed and future directions are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are complex, histologically
   benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that are challenging to measure by
   simple line measurements. Computer-aided volumetric segmentation of PN
   has become the recommended method to assess response in clinical trials
   directed at PN. Different methods for volumetric analysis of PN have
   been developed. The goal of this study is to test the level of agreement
   in volume measurements and in interval changes using two separate
   methods of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis.
   Methods: Three independent volume measurements were performed on 15 PN
   imaged at three time-points using 3DQI software at Massachusetts General
   Hospital (MGH) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) and MEDx software at
   NCI.
   Results: Median volume differences at each time-point comparing MGH-3DQI
   and NCI-3DQI were-0.5,-4.2, and-19.9 mL; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx
   were-21.0,-47.0, and-21.0 mL; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx
   were-10.0,-70.3, and-29.9 mL. Median differences in percentage change
   over time comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were-1.7, 1.1, and-1.0\%;
   comparing NCI3DQI and NCI-MEDx were-2.3, 3.3, and-1.1\%; comparing
   MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were-0.4, 2.0, and-1.5\%. Volume differences were
   <20\% of the mean of the two measurements in 117 of 135 comparisons
   (86.7\%). Difference in interval change was <20\% in 120 of the 135
   comparisons (88.9\%), while disease status classification was concordant
   in 115 of 135 comparisons (85.2\%).
   Conclusions: The volumes, interval changes, and progression status
   classifications were in good agreement. The comparison of two volumetric
   analysis methods suggests no systematic differences in tumor assessment.
   A prospective comparison of the two methods is planned.}},

Abstract = {{Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) also known as Spinocerebellar ataxia type
   3, is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease associated with severe
   clinical manifestations and premature death. Although rare, it is the
   most common autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide and has
   a distinct geographic distribution, reaching peak prevalence in certain
   regions of Brazil, Portugal and China. Due to its clinical
   heterogeneity, it was initially described as several different entities
   and as had many designations over the last decades. An accurate
   diagnosis become possible in 1994, after the identification of the MJD1
   gene. Among its wide clinical spectrum, progressive cerebellar ataxia is
   normally present. Other symptoms include pyramidal syndrome, peripheral
   neuropathy, oculomotor abnormalities, extrapyramidal signs and sleep
   disorders. On the basis of the presence/absence of important
   extra-pyramidal signs, and the presence/absence of peripheral signs,
   five clinical types have been defined. Neuroimaging studies like MRI,
   DTI and MRS, can be useful as they can characterize structural and
   functional differences in specific subgroups of patients with MJD. There
   is no effective treatment for MJD. Symptomatic therapies are used to
   relieve some of the clinical symptoms and physiotherapy is also helpful
   in improving quality of live. Several clinical trials have been carried
   out using different molecules like sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim,
   varenicline and lithium carbonate, but the results of these trials were
   negative or showed little benefit. Future studies sufficiently powered
   and adequately designed are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have demonstrated that combining nerve conduits with neural
   stem cells or growth factors can repair peripheral nerve injury in
   rodents. However, nerve damage does occur with longer gaps in human than
   in rodents, thus findings from rodent studies are difficult to translate
   to clinical practice. Minipigs have a longer gap that is more closely
   applicable to the challenge of human nerve grafting in extensive
   traumatic nerve damage. In this study, human amniotic fluid stem cells
   (AFSCs) and polylactate nerve conduits were used to repair sciatic nerve
   injury in minipigs. The AFSCs exhibited the properties of mesenchymal
   stem cells with a propensity toward neural stem cells. Measurements of
   compound muscle action potential implied that administration of conduits
   with AFSCs was beneficial in function recovery in the minipig model
   compared with conduits alone. The results of diffusion tensor magnetic
   resonance imaging (DTI) based fiber tractography assay in the minipig
   model suggest that combining AFSCs with conduits could expedite the
   repair of sciatic nerve injury. Further, MR-based DTI provides an
   effective and non-invasive method to visualize the sciatic nerve and to
   monitor the regeneration progress of injured nerve in a longitudinal
   study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   with sciatic nerve neurotmesis and surgical repair underwent serial
   multiparametric MR examinations over an 8-week period after
   subepineurial microinjection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequent
   subcutaneous injection of FK506 or subepineurial microinjection of LPS

   immunomodulation showed more prominent regeneration than those treated
   with LPS or PBS alone and more rapid restoration toward normal T2,
   fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial diffusivity (RD) values than
   nerves injected with LPS or PBS. Discussion: Nerves treated with
   immunomodulation exert synergic beneficial effects on nerve regeneration
   that can be predicted by T2 measurements and FA and RD values.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The management of peripheral nerve injuries remains a large
   challenge for plastic surgeons. With the inability to fuse axonal
   endings, results after microsurgical nerve repair have been
   inconsistent. Our current nerve repair strategies rely upon the slow and
   lengthy process of axonal regeneration (similar to 1 mm/d). Polyethylene
   glycol (PEG) has been investigated as a potential axonal fusion agent;
   however, the percentage of axonal fusion has been inconsistent. The
   purpose of this study was to identify a PEG delivery device to
   standardize outcomes after attempted axonal fusion with PEG.
   Materials and Methods: We used a rat sciatic nerve injury model in which
   we completely transected and repaired the left sciatic nerve to evaluate
   the efficacy of PEG fusion over a span of 12 weeks. In addition, we
   evaluated the effectiveness of a delivery device's ability to optimize
   results after PEG fusion.
   Results: We found that PEG rapidly (within minutes) restores axonal
   continuity as assessed by electrophysiology, fluorescent retrograde
   tracer, and diffusion tensor imaging. Immunohistochemical analysis shows
   that motor axon counts are significantly increased at 1 week, 4 weeks,
   and 12 weeks postoperatively in PEG-treated animals. Furthermore, PEG
   restored behavioral functions up to 50\% compared with animals that
   received the criterion standard epineurial repair (control animals).
   Conclusions: The ability of PEG to rapidly restore nerve function after
   neurotmesis could have vast implications on the clinical management of
   traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves.}},

   diffusion coefficient {[}ADC]).
   ResultsDTI showed lower FA and higher ADC in CMT1A compared with HCs. T2
   relaxation time showed no difference; however, PD of the sciatic nerve
   was higher in CMT1A. There were some close associations between
   neuropathy severity and MRN-DTI, with the closest correlation between FA
   and nerve conduction velocity in the sciatic nerve (r=0.76, P<0.01).

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathies refer to a group of disorders in
   which there is damage to the nerves of the peripheral nervous system.
   Electrophysiologic studies are the main stay for the diagnosis of
   peripheral neuropathies. However, direct visualization of the nerves is
   possible with exact localization of site of disease with high-resolution
   ultrasonography (USG) and 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   scanner, and newer magnetic resonance (MR) sequences.
   METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study including 55 patients and
   64 nerves with upper limb peripheral neuropathies. All patients included
   underwent high-resolution focused USG of the nerves and MR neurography.
   A nerve conduction velocity study was performed for reference.
   RESULTS: The diagnostic confidence of the turbo spin echo T2-weighted
   (T2W) MR sequence was seen to be highest, with a sensitivity of 95.31\%,
   whereas it was 81.25\% for USG. Continuity of the nerve in patients with
   traumatic neuropathy was seen in 65.7\% and 62.86\% (22/35) nerves on
   MRI and USG, respectively. T1-weighted and T2W MR sequences were seen to
   be equally effective in establishing the continuity of the nerve.
   Increase in the caliber/thickening was seen in 77\% of cases on MRI and
   73.8\% of cases on USG. Neuroma formation was seen equally on both MR
   and USG in 60.66\%. We consistently found low fractional anisotropy (FA)
   values at the site of disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: USG is a sensitive technique to diagnose peripheral
   neuropathies and it should be used as a screening modality for focused
   MR to be performed later. Turbo spin echo T2W fast spin has the highest
   sensitivity to identify nerve disease and is comparable with nerve
   conduction studies. Among the newer sequences, diffusion tensor imaging
   should be performed to increase diagnostic confidence.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo detect and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in multiple
   sclerosis (MS) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN).
   MethodsThirty-six patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald
   criteria (34 with the relapsing-remitting form, 2 with clinically
   isolated syndrome) with and without disease-modifying treatment were
   compared to 35 healthy age-/sex-matched volunteers. All patients
   underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations.
   Three Tesla MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the
   lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2-dimensional (2D)
   fat-saturated, T2-weighted (T2w) and dual echo turbo spin echo sequences
   as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides
   qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w signal quantification was
   performed by calculation of proton spin density and T2 relaxation time.
   Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion.
   ResultsT2w hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS
   patients, with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.55.7 versus
   19.1 +/- 2.4 in controls (p<0.0001). Nerve proton spin density was
   higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8 +/- 7.7/368.9 +/- 8.2) versus
   controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0 +/- 11.0/276.8 +/- 9.7, p<0.0001). In
   contrast, T2 relaxation time was significantly higher in controls
   (tibial/peroneal: 82.0 +/- 2.1/78.3 +/- 1.7) versus MS (tibial/peroneal:
   64.3 +/- 1.0/61.2 +/- 0.9, p<0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve
   caliber was higher in MS (tibial: 52.4 +/- 2.1mm(2), peroneal: 25.4 +/-
   1.3mm(2)) versus controls (tibial: 45.2 +/- 1.4mm(2), p<0.0015;
   peroneal: 21.3 +/- 0.7mm(2), p=0.0049).
   InterpretationPeripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and
   quantified in MS in vivo by high-resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by
   an increase of proton spin density and a decrease of T2 relaxation time,
   indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the
   extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing
   involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this
   proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology
   and treatment of MS. Ann Neurol 2017;82:676-685}},

Abstract = {{Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) refers to
   exercise-induced, reversible increases in pressure within well-defined
   inelastic fascial compartments leading to compromised tissue perfusion
   followed by functional loss, ischemic pain, and neurologic symptoms.
   Symptoms typically resolve when the activity ceases and there are
   usually no permanent sequelae. In the upper extremity, this condition
   most commonly affects athletes during sports requiring repetitive and
   vigorous gripping, such as rowers. In addition to clinical history and
   examination, a number of methods aid diagnosis, including compartment
   pressure measurements, magnetic resonance imaging, and near infrared
   spectroscopy. When symptoms persist despite conservative treatment,
   multiple operative techniques have been described to treat CECS
   including open, mini-open, and endoscopic release of involved
   compartments. We review the pathophysiology, diagnostic modalities,
   treatment strategies, and outcomes data for CECS of the upper extremity

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established imaging modality
   which is used in all districts of the musculoskeletal and peripheral
   nerve systems. More recently, initial studies have applied
   multiparametric MRI to evaluate quantitatively different aspects of
   musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve diseases, thus providing not only
   images but also numbers and clinical data. Besides H-1 and P-31 magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and blood
   oxygenation level-dependent imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a
   relatively new MRI-based technique relying on principles of DWI, which
   has traditionally been used mainly for evaluating the central nervous
   system to track fibre course. In the musculoskeletal and peripheral
   nerve systems, DTI has been mostly used in experimental settings, with
   still few indications in clinical practice. In this review, we describe
   the potential use of DTI to evaluate different musculoskeletal and
   peripheral nerve conditions, emphasising the translational aspects of
   this technique from the experimental to the clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate functional and morphometric magnetic resonance
   neurography of the dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve segments in
   patients with Fabry painful neuropathy.
   Methods: In this prospective study, the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia
   and proximal peripheral nerve segments of the lower extremity were
   examined in 11 male patients with Fabry disease by a standardized 3T
   magnetic resonance neurography protocol. Volumes of L3 to S2 dorsal root
   ganglia, perfusion parameters of L5-S1 dorsal root ganglia and the
   spinal nerve L5, and the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic
   nerve were compared to healthy controls.
   Results: Dorsal root ganglia of patients with Fabry disease were
   symmetrically enlarged by 78\% (L3), 94\% (L4), 122\% (L5), 115\% (S1),
   and 119\% (S2) (p < 0.001). In addition, permeability of the
   blood-tissue interface was decreased by 53\% (p < 0.001). This finding
   was most pronounced in the peripheral zone of the dorsal root ganglion
   containing the cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons (p < 0.001).
   Spinal nerve permeability showed no difference between patients with
   Fabry disease and controls (p = 0.7). The sciatic nerve of patients with
   Fabry disease at the thigh level showed an increase in cross-sectional
   area by 48\% (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Patients with Fabry disease have severely enlarged dorsal
   root ganglia with dysfunctional perfusion. This may be due to glycolipid
   accumulation in the dorsal root ganglia mediating direct neurotoxic
   effects and decreased neuronal blood supply. These alterations were less
   pronounced in peripheral nerve segments. Thus, the dorsal root ganglion
   might play a key pathophysiologic role in the development of neuropathy
   and pain in Fabry disease.}},

Title = {{Recent Developments in Fast Kurtosis Imaging}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension of the popular
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique. DKI takes into account leading
   deviations from Gaussian diffusion stemming from a number of effects
   related to the microarchitecture and compartmentalization in biological
   tissues. DKI therefore offers increased sensitivity to subtle
   microstructural alterations over conventional diffusion imaging such as
   DTI, as has been demonstrated in numerous reports. For this reason,
   interest in routine clinical application of DKI is growing rapidly. In
   an effort to facilitate more widespread use of DKI, recent work by our
   group has focused on developing experimentally fast and robust estimates
   of DKI metrics. A significant increase in speed is made possible by a
   reduction in data demand achieved through rigorous analysis of the
   relation between the DKI signal and the kurtosis tensor based metrics.
   The fast DKI methods therefore need only 13 or 19 images for DKI
   parameter estimation compared to more than 60 for the most modest DKI
   protocols applied today. Closed form solutions also ensure rapid
   calculation of most DKI metrics. Some parameters can even be
   reconstructed in real time, which may be valuable in the clinic. The
   fast techniques are based on conventional diffusion sequences and are
   therefore easily implemented on almost any clinical system, in contrast
   to a range of other recently proposed advanced diffusion techniques. In
   addition to its general applicability, this also ensures that any
   acceleration achieved in conventional DKI through sequence or hardware
   optimization will also translate directly to fast DKI acquisitions. In
   this review, we recapitulate the theoretical basis for the fast kurtosis
   techniques and their relation to conventional DKI. We then discuss the
   currently available variants of the fast kurtosis techniques, their
   strengths and weaknesses, as well as their respective realms of
   application. These range from whole body applications to methods mostly
   suited for spinal cord or peripheral nerve, and analysis specific to
   brain white matter. Having covered these technical aspects, we proceed
   to review the fast kurtosis literature including validation studies,
   organ specific optimization studies and results from clinical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations in the NEFH gene encoding the heavy neurofilament protein are
   usually associated with neuronal damage and susceptibility to
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recently, frameshift variants in
   NEFH (p. Asp1004Glnfs{*} 58 and p. Pro1008Alafs{*} 56) have been
   reported to be the underlying cause of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth
   disease type 2CC (CMT2CC). The frameshift mutation resulted in a stop
   loss and translation of a cryptic amyloidogenic element (CAE) encoded by
   the 3' untranslated region (UTR). This study also identified a de novo
   c. 3015\_ 3027dup frameshift mutation predicting p. Lys1010Glnfs{*} 57
   in NEFH from a CMT2 family with an atypical clinical symptom of
   prominent proximal weakness. This mutation is located near the
   previously reported frameshift mutations, suggesting a mutational
   hotspot. Lower limb magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed marked
   hyperintense signal changes in the thigh muscles compared with those in
   the calf muscles. Therefore, this study suggests that the stop loss and
   translational elongations by the 3' UTR of the NEFH mutations may be a
   relatively frequent genetic cause of axonal peripheral neuropathy with
   the specific characteristics of proximal dominant weakness.}},

Abstract = {{From time to time it is thoughtful and productive to review a medical
   field and reflect upon what are the major issues that need to be
   addressed and what is being done to do so. This review article is not
   meant to be all-inclusive but rather focuses on four evolving areas in
   the field of peripheral nerve disorders and treatments: (1) nerve
   surgery under ultrasound guidance using a new ultra-minimally invasive
   thread technique; (2) evolving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
   ultrasound imaging techniques that are helping to both diagnose and
   treat a variety of peripheral nerve problems including entrapment
   neuropathies, traumatic nerve injuries, and masses arising from nerves;
   (3) promoting recovery after nerve injury using electrical stimulation;
   and (4) developing animal models to reproduce a severe nerve injury
   (neurotmetic grade in continuity) that requires a surgical intervention
   and repair. In each area we first describe the current challenges and
   then discuss new and emerging techniques and approaches. It is our hope
   that this article will bring added attention and resources to help
   better address peripheral nerve problems that remain a challenge for
   both patients and physicians.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in the measurement of
   peripheral nerve integrity, although the optimal way to apply the
   technique for the study of lumbar spinal nerves is unclear. The aims of
   this study are to use an improved DTI acquisition to investigate lumbar
   nerve root integrity and correlate this with functional measures using
   neurophysiology.
   Twenty healthy volunteers underwent 3 T DTI of the L5/S1 area. Regions
   of interest were applied to L5 and S1 nerve roots, and DTI metrics
   (fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity) were
   derived. Neurophysiological measures were obtained from muscles
   innervated by L5/S1 nerves; these included the slope of motor-evoked
   potential input-output curves, F-wave latency, maximal motor response,
   and central and peripheral motor conduction times.
   DTI metrics were similar between the left and right sides and between
   vertebral levels. Conversely, significant differences in DTI measures
   were seen along the course of the nerves. Regression analyses revealed
   that DTI metrics of the L5 nerve correlated with neurophysiological
   measures from the muscle innervated by it.
   The current findings suggest that DTI has the potential to be used for
   assessing lumbar spinal nerve integrity and that parameters derived from
   DTI provide quantitative information which reflects their function.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To investigate in vivo morphological and functional correlates of

   assessment included volumetry of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), sciatic
   nerve normalized T2 (nT2) signal and caliber, and fractional anisotropy
   (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD).
   Additional qualitative evaluation of sciatic, peroneal, and tibial
   nerves evaluated the presence, degree, and distribution of nerve
   lesions.
   Results
   DRG hypertrophy in OXA-PNP patients (207.3 +/- 47.7mm(3) vs. 153.0 +/-
   47.1mm(3) in controls, p = 0.001) was found as significant morphological
   correlate of the sensory neuronopathy. In contrast, peripheral nerves
   only exhibited minor morphological alterations qualitatively.
   Quantitatively, sciatic nerve caliber (27.3 +/- 6.7mm(2) vs. 27.4 +/-
   7.4mm(2), p = 0.80) and nT2 signal were not significantly changed in
   patients (1.32 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.22 +/- 0.26, p = 0.16). AD, RD, and MD
   showed a non-significant decrease in patients, while FA was unchanged.
   Conclusion
   OXA-PNP manifests with morphological and functional correlates that can
   be detected in vivo by MRN. We report hypertrophy of the DRG that stands
   in contrast to experimental and postmortem studies. DRG volume should be
   further investigated as a biomarker in other sensory peripheral
   neuropathies and ganglionopathies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of
   3 T magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the
   brachial plexus in healthy subjects.
   Methods: Ten healthy volunteers were included, and morphological and DTI
   sequences of the nerve roots of the brachial plexus from C5 to T1 of
   both sides were repeatedly acquired on a 3 T magnetic resonance system
   (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). A prototype
   diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence-enabling
   slice-specific shim adjustments was performed with b-values of 0 and 800
   s/mm(2) in 30 gradient directions, resulting in an acquisition time of
   about 6 minutes each in axial orientation. Between scans, subjects were
   moved and repositioned in the scanner, coils were reinserted, and new
   localizers were acquired. Image analysis was performed using MITK
   Diffusion software toolkit. Two independent readers performed diffusion
   data postprocessing, and regions of interest (ROIs) were set on the
   proximal postganglionic trunk at each spinal level, bilaterally to
   obtain values for fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD).
   Interreader and intrareader agreement as well as test-retest
   reproducibility of DTI metrics were assessed.
   Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for interreader and
   intrareader agreement did not differ significantly between measurements
   for FA and MD. In particular, ICCs for interreader agreement of FA
   ranged from 0.741 to 0.961 and that of MD ranged from 0.802 to 0.998,
   and ICCs for intrareader agreement of FA ranged from 0.759 to 0.949 and
   that ofMD ranged from 0.796 to 0.998. The test-retest reproducibility of
   DTI metrics showed an overall moderate to strong correlation (r >
   0.707), with few minor exceptions, for both FA and MD values.
   Conclusions: Diffusion tensor imaging metrics in the brachial plexus are
   reproducible. Future applications of DTI for a possible clinical use
   should be further investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To detect and quantify lesions of the small-caliber sural
   nerve (SN) in symptomatic and asymptomatic transthyretin familial
   amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) by high-resolution magnetic resonance
   neurography (MRN) in correlation with electrophysiologic and
   histopathologic findings.
   Methods: Twenty-five patients with TTR-FAP, 10 asymptomatic carriers of
   the mutated transthyretin gene (mutTTR), and 35 age- and sex-matched
   healthy controls were prospectively included in this cross-sectional
   case-control study. All participants underwent 3T MRN with
   high-structural resolution (fat-saturated, T2-weighted, and double-echo
   sequences). Total imaging time was approximate to 45 minutes per
   patient. Manual SN segmentation was performed from its origin at the
   sciatic nerve bifurcation to the lower leg with subsequent evaluation of
   quantitative microstructural and morphometric parameters. Additional
   time needed for postprocessing was approximate to 1.5 hours per
   participant. Detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic examinations
   were conducted in the TTR group.
   Results: T2 signal and proton spin density (rho) reliably differentiated
   between TTR-FAP (198.0 +/- 13.3, 429.6 +/- 15.25), mutTTR carriers
   (137.0 +/- 16.9, p = 0.0009; 354.7 +/- 21.64, p = 0.0029), and healthy
   controls (90.0 +/- 3.4, 258.2 +/- 9.10; p < 0.0001). Marked differences
   between mutTTR carriers and controls were found for T2 signal (p =
   0.0065) and rho (p < 0.0001). T2 relaxation time was higher in patients
   with TTR-FAP only (p = 0.015 vs mutTTR carriers, p = 0.0432 vs
   controls). SN caliber was higher in patients with TTR-FAP vs controls
   and in mutTTR carriers vs controls (p < 0.0001). Amyloid deposits were
   histopathologically detectable in 10 of 14 SN specimens.
   Conclusions: SN injury in TTR-FAP is detectable and quantifiable in vivo
   by MRN even in asymptomatic mutTTR carriers. Differences in SN T2 signal
   between controls and asymptomatic mutTTR carriers are derived mainly
   from an increase of rho, which overcomes typical limitations of
   established diagnostic methods as a highly sensitive imaging biomarker
   for early detection of peripheral nerve lesions. Classification of
   evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that MRN accurately
   identifies asymptomatic mutTTR carriers.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic conditions of peripheral nerves and plexus have been
   classically evaluated by morphological imaging techniques and
   electrophysiological tests. New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies
   based on 3D fat- suppressed techniques are providing high accuracy for
   peripheral nerve injury evaluation from a qualitative point of view.
   However, these techniques do not provide quantitative information.
   Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are
   functional MRI techniques that are able to evaluate and quantify the
   movement of water molecules within different biological structures.
   These techniques have been successfully applied in other anatomical
   areas, especially in the assessment of central nervous system, and now
   are being imported, with promising results for peripheral nerve and
   plexus evaluation. DWI and DTI allow performing a qualitative and
   quantitative peripheral nerve analysis, providing valuable
   pathophysiological information about functional integrity of these
   structures. In the field of trauma and peripheral nerve or plexus
   injury, several derived parameters from DWI and DTI studies such as
   apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or fractional anisotropy (FA) among
   others, can be used as potential biomarkers of neural damage providing
   information about fiber organization, axonal flow or myelin integrity. A
   proper knowledge of physical basis of these techniques and their
   limitations is important for an optimal interpretation of the imaging
   findings and derived data. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the
   potential applications of DWI and DTI neurographic studies is performed
   with a focus on traumatic conditions, including main nerve entrapment
   syndromes in both peripheral nerves and brachial or lumbar plexus.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the diagnostic accuracy and interobserver performance of
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)
   and detect correlations with electrophysiology.
   Twelve healthy volunteers (controls) and ten DPN patients were enrolled
   to undergo MR examinations. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent
   diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of tibial nerve (TN) and common
   peroneal nerve (CPN) were measured. Unpaired t test and Levene tests
   were performed to assess differences between the two groups. Receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for FA and ADC
   values. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the
   correlation between DTI and electrophysiology parameters in the patient
   group.
   The FA values of TN and CPN in the DPN group were significantly lower
   and ADC were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Interobserver
   agreement was excellent. FA positively correlated and ADC negatively
   correlated with motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) (p < 0.05). There
   were no significant differences between motor nerve conduction amplitude
   and DTI parameters (p > 0.05). Moderate diagnostic accuracy of DTI was
   seen in the diagnosis of DPN.
   DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy and excellent
   interobserver performance in the detection of DPN involving the TN and
   CPN. There is moderate correlation with MCV.
   aEuro cent FA values of TN and CPN are significantly lower in DPN.

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate large coverage magnetic
   resonance neurography (MRN) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating
   polyneuropathy (CIDP). In this prospective study, 18 patients with CIDP
   and 18 healthy controls were examined by a standardized MRN protocol at
   3 T. Lumbosacral plexus was imaged by a T2-weighted 3D sequence and
   peripheral nerves of the upper and lower extremity by axial T2-weighted
   turbo spin-echo sequences. Lesions were characterized by nerve
   cross-sectional area (CSA) and T2-weighted signal (nT2). Additionally,
   T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve was performed using a
   multi-spin-echo sequence. All patients received a complementary
   electrophysiological exam. Patients with CIDP exhibited increased nerve
   CSA and nT2 compared to controls (p < 0.05) in a proximally
   predominating pattern. Receiver operating characteristic analysis
   revealed the best diagnostic accuracy for CSA of the lumbosacral plexus
   (AUC = 0.88) and nT2 of the sciatic nerve (AUC = 0.88). CSA correlated
   with multiple electrophysiological parameters of demyelinating
   neuropathy (F wave latency, nerve conduction velocity) of sciatic and
   median nerve, while nT2 only correlated with F wave latency of sciatic
   and not median nerve. T2 relaxometry indicated that MR signal increase
   in CIDP was due to an increase in proton-spin-density (p < 0.05), and
   not due to the increase in T2 relaxation time. Both nT2 and CSA might
   aid in the diagnosis of CIDP, but CSA correlates more robustly with
   established electrophysiological parameters for CIDP. Since the best
   diagnostic accuracy was shown for proximal nerve locations, MRN may be a
   useful complementary tool in selected CIDP cases.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates whether diffusion tensor imaging magnetic resonance
   neurography (DTI-MRN), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density can
   detect and grade neuropathic abnormalities in patients with type 1
   diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 49) were included-11 with
   severe polyneuropathy (sDPN), 13 with mild polyneuropathy (mDPN), and 25
   without polyneuropathy (nDPN)-along with 30 healthy control subjects
   (HCs). Clinical examinations, nerve conduction studies, and vibratory
   perception thresholds determined the presence and severity of DPN.
   DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal (tibial nerve) nerve
   segments of the lower extremity. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the
   apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated, as were T2
   relaxation time and proton spin density obtained from DTI-MRN. All
   magnetic resonance findings were related to the presence and severity of
   neuropathy. FA of the sciatic and tibial nerves was lowest in the sDPN
   group. Corresponding with this, proximal and distal ADCs were highest in
   patients with sDPN compared with patients with mDPN and nDPN, as well as
   the HCs. DTI-MRN correlated closely with the severity of neuropathy,
   demonstrating strong associations with sciatic and tibial nerve
   findings. Quantitative group differences in proton spin density were
   also significant, but less pronounced than those for DTI-MRN. In
   conclusion, DTI-MRN enables detection in peripheral nerves of
   abnormalities related to DPN, more so than proton spin density or T2
   relaxation time. These abnormalities are likely to reflect pathology in
   sciatic and tibial nerve fibers.}},

Abstract = {{Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease
   characterized by selective motor neuron degeneration in the motor
   cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. It is generally accepted that ALS is
   caused by death of motor neurons, however the exact temporal cascade of
   degenerative processes is not yet completely known. To identify the
   early pathological changes in spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 AIS mice we
   performed a comprehensive longitudinal analysis employing
   diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging alongside histology and
   electron microscopy, in parallel with peripheral nerve histology. We
   showed the gradient of degeneration appearance in spinal cord white and
   gray matter, starting earliest in the ventral white matter, due to a
   cascade of pathological events including axon dysfunction and
   mitochondrial changes. Notably, we found that even the main sensory
   regions are affected by the neurodegenerative process at symptomatic
   disease phase. Overall our results attest the applicability of DTI in
   determining disease progression in ALS mice. These findings suggest that
   DTI could be potentially adapted in humans to aid the assessment of ALS
   progression and eventually the evaluation of treatment efficacy. (C)

   enhanced vascular imaging}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of Ultra-high
   field {[}UHF] 7 Tesla {[}T] MRI as compared to 3T MRI in non-contrast
   enhanced {[}nCE] imaging of structural anatomy in the elbow, forearm,
   and hand {[}upper extremity].
   Materials and method
   A wide range of sequences including T1 weighted {[}T1] volumetric
   interpolate breath-hold exam {[}VIBE], T2 weighted {[}T2] double-echo
   steady state {[}DESS], susceptibility weighted imaging {[}SWI],
   time-of-flight {[}TOF], diffusion tensor imaging {[}DTI], and diffusion
   spectrum imaging {[}DSI] were optimized and incorporated with a
   radiofrequency {[}RF] coil system composed of a transverse
   electromagnetic {[}TEM] transmit coil combined with an 8-channel
   receive-only array for 7T upper extremity {[}UE] imaging. In addition,
   Siemens optimized protocol/ sequences were used on a 3T scanner and the
   resulting images from T1 VIBE and T2 DESS were compared to that obtained
   at 7T qualitatively and quantitatively {[}SWI was only qualitatively
   compared]. DSI studio was utilized to identify nerves based on analysis
   of diffusion weighted derived fractional anisotropy images. Images of
   forearm vasculature were extracted using a paint grow manual
   segmentation method based on MIPAV {[}Medical Image Processing,
   Analysis, and Visualization].
   Results
   High resolution and high quality signal-to-noise ratio {[}SNR] and
   contrast-to-noise ratio {[}CNR] D images of the hand, forearm, and elbow
   were acquired with nearly homogeneous 7T excitation. Measured
   {[}performed on the T1 VIBE and T2 DESS sequences] SNR and CNR values
   were almost doubled at 7T vs. 3T. Cartilage, synovial fluid and tendon
   structures could be seen with higher clarity in the 7T T1 and T2
   weighted images. SWI allowed high resolution and better quality imaging
   of large and medium sized arteries and veins,capillary networks and
   arteriovenous anastomoses at 7T when compared to 3T. 7T diffusion
   weighted sequence {[}not performed at 3T] demonstrates that the forearm
   nerves are clearly delineated by fiber tractography. The proper digital
   palmar arteries and superficial palmar arch could also be clearly
   visualized using TOF nCE 7T MRI.
   Conclusion
   Ultra-high resolution neurovascular imaging in upper extremities is
   possible at 7T without use of renal toxic intravenous contrast. 7T MRI
   can provide superior peripheral nerve {[}based on fiber anisotropy and
   diffusion coefficient parameters derived from diffusion tensor/spectrum
   imaging] and vascular {[}nCE MRA and vessel segmentation] imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aims to compare engineered nerve conduits
   constructed from porcine-derived urinary bladder matrix (UBM) with the
   criterion-standard nerve autografts, for segmental loss peripheral nerve
   repairs.
   Methods: Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups. All
   underwent a 10-mm sciatic nerve gap injury. This was repaired using
   either (1) reverse autograft-the 10-mm cut segment was oriented 180
   degrees and used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps or (2) UBM
   conduit-the 10-mm nerve gap was bridged with UBM conduit. Behavior
   assessments such as sciatic function index and foot fault asymmetry
   scores were performed weekly. At 3-or 6-week time endpoints, the
   repaired nerves and bilateral gastrocnemius/soleus muscles were
   harvested from each animal. Nerves were evaluated using
   immunohistochemistry for motor and sensory axon staining and with
   diffusion tensor imaging. The net wet muscle weights were calculated to
   assess the degree of muscle atrophy.
   Results: The UBM group demonstrated significantly improved foot fault
   asymmetry scores at 2 and 4 weeks, whereas there was no difference in
   sciatic function index. The net muscle weights were similar between both
   groups. Motor axon counts proximal/inside/distal to the conduit/graft
   were similar between UBM conduits and reverse autografts, whereas
   sensory axon counts within and distal to the conduit were significantly
   higher than those of the autograft at 6 weeks. Sensory axonal
   regeneration seemed to be adherent to the inner surface of the UBM
   conduit, whereas it had a scattered appearance in autografts. Diffusion
   tensor imaging parameters between groups were similar.
   Conclusions: Urinary bladder matrix conduits prove to be at least
   similar to nerve autografts for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries
   with a short gap. The matrix perhaps serves as a scaffold to augment
   sensory nerve growth. Clinical Relevance: In a clinical setting, UBM may
   eliminate the donor site morbidity and increased operative time
   associated with nerve autografting.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the feasibility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
   neurography (DW-MRN) in the visualisation of extremity nerves in the
   wrist and palm.
   Thirty-two volunteers and 21 patients underwent imaging of the wrist and
   palm on a 3-T MR scanner. In all subjects, two radiologists evaluated
   the image quality on DW-MRN using a four-point grading scale. Kappa
   statistics were obtained for inter-observer performance. In volunteers,
   the chi-squared test was used to assess the differences in nerve
   visualisation on DW-MRN and axial fat-suppressed proton density weighted
   imaging (FS-PDWI).
   In volunteers, the mean image quality scores for the median nerve (MN)
   and ulnar nerve (UN) were 3.71 +/- 0.46 and 3.23 +/- 0.67 for observer
   1, and 3.70 +/- 0.46 and 3.22 +/- 0.71 for observer 2, respectively. The
   inter-observer agreement was excellent (k = 0.843) and good (k = 0.788),
   respectively. DW-MRN provided significantly improved visualisations of
   the second and the third common palmar digital nerves and three branches
   of UN compared with FS-PDWI (P < 0.05). In patients, the mean image
   quality scores for the two observers were 3.24 +/- 0.62 and 3.10 +/-
   0.83, inter-observer performance was excellent (k = 0.842).
   DW-MRN is feasible for improved visualisation of extremity nerves and
   their lesions in the wrist and palm with adequate image quality, thereby
   providing a supplementary method to conventional MR imaging.
   aEuro cent DW-MRN provides adequate image quality for wrist and palm
   neurography
   aEuro cent DW-MRN performs similarly to FS-PDWI in nerve visualisation
   at the wrist
   aEuro cent DW-MRN provides improved visualisation of small nerves in the
   palm
   aEuro cent DW-MRN serves as a supplementary method to evaluate
   peripheral neuropathies.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical trial design in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains
   hampered by a lack of reliable and sensitive biomarkers of disease
   progression. The present study evaluated peripheral nerve diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) as a surrogate marker of axonal degeneration in
   ALS. Longitudinal studies were undertaken in 21 ALS patients studied at
   0 and 3 months, and 19 patients at 0, 3 and 6 months, with results
   compared to 13 age-matched controls. Imaging metrics were correlated
   across a range of functional assessments including amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R), lower limb muscle
   strength (Medical Research Council sum score, MRCSS-LL), compound muscle
   action potential amplitudes and motor unit number estimation (MUNE).
   Fractional anisotropy was reduced at baseline in ALS patients in the
   tibial (p < 0.05), and peroneal nerve (p < 0.05). Fractional anisotropy
   and axial diffusivity declined in the tibial nerve between baselines, 3-
   and 6-month scans (p < 0.01). From a functional perspective, ALSFRS-R
   correlated with fractional anisotropy values from tibial (R = 0.75, p <
   0.001) and peroneal nerves (R = 0.52, p = 0.001). Similarly, peroneal
   nerve MUNE values correlated with fractional anisotropy values from the
   tibial (R = 0.48, p = 0.002) and peroneal nerve (R = 0.39, p = 0.01).
   There were correlations between the change in ALSFRS-R and tibial nerve
   axial diffusivity (R = 0.38, p = 0.02) and the change in MRCSS-LL and
   peroneal nerve fractional anisotropy (R = 0.44, p = 0.009). In
   conclusion, this study has demonstrated that some peripheral nerve DTI
   metrics are sensitive to axonal degeneration in ALS. Further, that DTI
   metrics correlated with measures of functional disability, strength and
   neurophysiological measures of lower motor neuron loss.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The neurofibromatoses (NF) type 1 and 2 are hereditary tumor
   predisposition syndromes caused by germline mutations in the NF1 and NF2
   tumor suppressor genes. In NF1 and 2, peripheral nerve tumors occur
   regularly. For further characterizing nerve ultrasound was performed in
   patients with NF1 and 2.
   Methods: Patients with established diagnosis of NF1 (n = 27) and NF2 (n
   = 10) were included. Ultrasound of peripheral nerves and cervical roots
   was performed during routine follow-up visits. Healthy volunteers were
   studied for comparison.
   Results: In patients with NF1, median cross-sectional area (CSA) of most
   nerves was significantly increased compared to controls and to NF2 due
   to generalized plexiform tumors, which arose out of multiple fascicles
   in 23 of 27 patients (85\%). These were often accompanied by cutaneous
   or subcutaneous neurofibromas. In NF2, the overall aspect of peripheral
   nerves consisted of localized schwannomas (80\%) and, apart from that,
   normal nerve segments.
   Conclusion: Nerve ultrasound is able to visualize different nerve
   pathologies in NF1 and NF2. It is a precise and inexpensive screening
   method for peripheral nerve manifestation in neurofibromatosis and
   should be considered as the first choice screening imaging modality for
   all peripheral nerves within reach of non-invasive ultrasound
   techniques.
   Significance: Ultrasound patterns of peripheral nerve pathologies are
   described for the first time in a large cohort of patients with NF1 and
   NF2. It is a suitable screening tool and enables targeted MRI analysis.

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve conduits were fabricated from bio-degradable
   polyurethane (PU) which was synthesized by a waterborne process. The
   biodegradable PU was based on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) diol and
   polyethylene butylene adipate diol (2:3 molar ratio) as the soft
   segment. Conduits formed by the freeze-drying process had asymmetric
   microporous structure. The PU nerve conduits were used to bridge a 10-mm
   gap in rat sciatic nerve. Nerve regeneration was evaluated by walking
   track analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrophysiological,
   and histological analyses. Results demonstrated that after 6 weeks,
   walking function was recovered by 40\%. MR images showed that the
   transected nerve was reconnected after 3 weeks and the diameter of the
   regenerated nerve increased from 3 to 6 weeks. The nerve conduction
   velocity of the regenerated nerve reached 50\% of the normal value after
   6 weeks. Histological examination revealed that the cross-sectional area
   of the regenerated nerve at the midconduit was 0.24 mm(2) after 6 weeks.
   The efficacy of PU nerve conduits based on functional recovery and
   histology was superior to that of commercial conduits (Neurotube). The
   PU nerve conduit developed in this study may be a potential candidate
   for clinical peripheral nerve tissue engineering. (C) 2017 Wiley

Abstract = {{Objectives: Widespread sensory deficits occur in 20-40\% of chronic pain
   patients on the side of pain, independent of pain aetiology, and are
   known as nondermatomal sensory deficits (NDSDs). NDSDs can occur in
   absence of central or peripheral nervous system lesions. We hypothesised
   that NDSDs were associated with cerebral grey matter changes in the
   sensory system and in pain processing regions, detectable with
   voxel-based morphometry. Methods: Twenty-five patients with NDSDs, 23
   patients without NDSDs (pain-only), and 29 healthy controls were studied
   with high resolution structural MRI of the brain. A comprehensive
   clinical and psychiatric evaluation based on Diagnostic and Statistical
   Manual was performed in all patients. Results: Patients with NDSDs and
   pain-only did not differ concerning demographic data and psychiatric
   diagnoses, although anxiety scores (HADS-A) were higher in patients with
   NDSDs. In patients with NDSDs, grey matter increases were found in the
   right primary sensory cortex, thalamus, and bilaterally in lateral
   temporal regions and the hippocampus/fusiform gyrus. Pain-only patients
   showed a bilateral grey matter increase in the posterior insula and less
   pronounced changes in sensorimotor cortex. Conclusions: Dysfunctional
   sensory processing in patients with NDSDs is associated with complex
   changes in grey matter volume, involving the somatosensory system and

Abstract = {{PurposeTo evaluate if diffusion tensor imaging MR neurography (DTI-MRN)
   can detect lesions of peripheral nerves in patients with type 1
   diabetes.
   Materials and MethodsEleven type 1 diabetic patients with polyneuropathy
   (DPN), 10 type 1 diabetic patients without polyneuropathy (nDPN), and 10
   healthy controls (HC) were investigated with a 3T MRI scanner. Clinical
   examinations, nerve-conduction studies, and vibratory-perception
   thresholds determined the presence of DPN. DTI-MRN (voxel size: 1.4 x
   1.4 x 3mm(3); b-values: 0, 800 s/mm(2)) covered proximal (sciatic nerve)
   and distal regions of the lower extremity (tibial nerve). Fractional
   anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated
   and compared to T-2-relaxometry and proton-spin density obtained from a
   multiecho turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated DTI
   reproducibility, repeatability, and diagnostic accuracy.
   ResultsDTI-MRN could accurately discriminate between DPN, nDPN, and HC.
   The proximal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 0.370.06; nDPN 0.470.03; HC
   0.490.06; P < 0.01). In addition, distal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 0.31
   +/- 0.05; nDPN 0.41 +/- 0.07; HC 0.43 +/- 0.08; P < 0.01). Likewise,
   proximal ADC was highest in DPN (DPN 1.69 +/- 0.25 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s; nDPN
   1.50 +/- 0.06 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s; HC 1.42 +/- 0.12 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s; P <
   0.01) as was distal ADC (DPN 1.87 +/- 0.45 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s; nDPN 1.59
   +/- 0.19 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s; HC 1.57 +/- 0.26 x 10(-3)mm(2)/s; P=0.09). The
   combined interclass-correlation (ICC) coefficient of DTI reproducibility
   and repeatability was high in the sciatic nerve (ICC: FA=0.86; ADC=0.85)
   and the tibial nerve (ICC: FA=0.78; ADC=0.66). T-2-relaxometry and
   proton-spin-density did not enable detection of neuropathy.
   ConclusionDTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher
   ADC. These alterations are likely to reflect proximal and distal nerve
   fiber pathology.}},

Abstract = {{Technical advances are rapidly changing the clinical and instrumental
   approach to peripheral nerve diseases. Magnetic resonance neurography,
   diffusion tensor imaging and nerve ultrasonography are increasingly
   entering the diagnostic workup of peripheral neuropathies as tools that
   complement neurophysiology and enable investigation of proximal
   structures, such as plexuses and roots. Progress in the design of
   magnetic resonance scanners and sequences, and the development of
   high-frequency ultrasound probes mean that high-resolution peripheral
   nerve imaging is possible, enabling detailed examination of nerve size,
   morphology and internal fascicular structure that can integrate nerve
   conduction studies into clinical practice. In the growing field of
   small-fibre neuropathy, in which traditional nerve conduction studies
   are of little or no use, skin biopsy has become a reliable tool for
   diagnosis. Corneal confocal microscopy, nociceptive evoked potentials
   and microneurography are emerging techniques that are mainly used in
   clinical research settings, but have increasing relevance to clinical
   practice. We review these new and emerging techniques and their effects
   on diagnosis, treatment strategies and prognosis in a variety of
   peripheral neuropathies, including entrapments, brachial plexopathies,
   immune and inherited neuropathies, and small-fibre neuropathies. We
   discuss the most promising research findings and their potential for
   future application in clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely used to visualize
   peripheral nerves, but the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can
   be assessed using DTI. However, there are no data regarding the
   association among microstructural changes evaluated using DTI, the
   symptoms assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the
   duration of symptoms after surgery in patients with lumbar disc
   herniation (LDH). Thirty patients with unilateral radiculopathy were
   investigated using DTI. The changes in the mean fractional anisotropy
   (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values as well as the
   correlation between these changes and the severity and duration of the
   clinical symptoms were investigated before and at least one month after
   surgery. The FA values were significantly increased after surgical
   treatment (p < 0.0001). Both the ADC and ODI values were noticeably
   decreased (p < 0.0001). A strong positive correlation between the
   preoperative and postoperative DTI parameters (p < 0.0001) as well as
   between the preoperative ODI and postoperative ODI/ODI changes (p <
   0.0001) were found. In addition, there was a significant positive
   correlation between the changes in the DTI parameters and changes in the
   ODI (p < 0.0001). This preliminary study suggests it may be possible to
   use DTI to diagnose, quantitatively evaluate and follow-up patients with

Abstract = {{Objective. Despite modern antiretroviral therapy, HIV-associated
   neuropathy is one of the most prevalent, disabling and
   treatment-resistant complications of HIV disease. The presence and
   intensity of distal neuropathic pain is not fully explained by the
   degree of peripheral nerve damage. A better understanding of brain
   structure in HIV distal neuropathic pain may help explain why some
   patients with HIV neuropathy report pain while the majority does not.
   Previously, we reported that more intense distal neuropathic pain was
   associated with smaller total cerebral cortical gray matter volumes. The
   objective of this study was to determine which parts of the cortex are
   smaller.
   Methods. HIV positive individuals with and without distal neuropathic
   pain enrolled in the multisite (N = 233) CNS HIV Antiretroviral
   Treatment Effects (CHARTER) study underwent structural brain magnetic
   resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate
   regional brain volumes in these structural brain images.
   Results. Left ventral posterior cingulate cortex was smaller for HIV
   positive individuals with versus without distal neuropathic pain (peak P
   = 0.017; peak t = 5.15; MNI coordinates x = -6, y = -54, z = 20).
   Regional brain volumes within cortical gray matter structures typically
   associated with pain processing were also smaller for HIV positive
   individuals having higher intensity ratings of distal neuropathic pain.
   Conclusions. The posterior cingulate is thought to be involved in
   inhibiting the perception of painful stimuli. Mechanistically a smaller
   posterior cingulate cortex structure may be related to reduced
   anti-nociception contributing to increased distal neuropathic pain.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics
   as biomarkers for the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) in acute peripheral nerve injury.
   Materials and Methods: Forty-four adult rats received subepineurial
   microinjection of MSCs (n=22) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n=22) 1
   week after the sciatic nerve trunk crush injury. Sequential
   fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging, T2 measurement, DTI and sciatic
   nerve functional assessment were performed at a 3.0 Tesla MR unit over
   an 8-week follow-up, with histological assessments performed at regular
   intervals. The sciatic nerve function index, T2 value, and DTI metrics,
   including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, radial
   diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity values of the distal stumps of
   crushed nerves were measured and compared between the two groups.
   Results: Nerves treated with MSCs showed better functional recovery and
   exhibited more pronounced nerve regeneration compared with nerves
   treated with PBS. T2 values in nerves treated with MSCs or PBS showed a
   similar change pattern (P=0.174), while FA and RD values in nerves
   treated with MSCs showed more rapid return (one week earlier) to
   baseline level than nerves treated with PBS (P=0.045; 0.035). Nerves
   treated with MSCs had higher FA and lower RD values than nerves treated
   with PBS during the period from 2 to 3 weeks after surgery (P0.0001,
   0.004; P=0.004, 0.006).
   Conclusion: FA and RD values derived from DTI might be used as sensitive
   biomarkers for detecting the therapeutic effect of stem cells in acute
   peripheral nerve crush injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve injury is a common and important cause of morbidity and
   disability in patients who have suffered a traumatic injury,
   particularly younger people. Various different injuries can result in
   damage to specific nerves. In patients with multiple trauma, the
   prevalence of peripheral nerve injury is estimated at 2.8\%, but can
   reach 5\% with the inclusion of brachial plexus involvement. Physical
   examination, as well as the origin and location of the trauma, can
   indicate the nerve involved and the type of nerve damage. However, the
   depth and severity of damage, and the structures involved often cannot
   be determined initially, but depend on longer periods of observation to
   reach a definitive and accurate diagnosis for which treatment can be
   proposed.
   Current approaches to locate and assess the severity of traumatic nerve
   injury involve clinical and electrodiagnostic studies. From a clinical
   and neurophysiological point of view, nerve injuries are classified in
   an attempt to correlate the degree of injury with symptoms, type of
   pathology, and prognosis, as well as to determine the therapy to be
   adopted.
   MRI in the diagnosis of traumatic peripheral nerve injury has
   increasingly been used by surgeons in clinical practice. In this
   article, we analyze the use of magnetic resonance (MR) for the
   evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve diseases that are surgically
   treatable. We also consider basic concepts in the evaluation of
   technical and MR signs of peripheral nerve injuries.
   Studies were identified following a computerized search of MEDLINE (1950
   to present), EMBASE (1980 to present), and the Cochrane database. The
   MEDLINE search was conducted on PUBMED, the EMBASE search was conducted
   on OVID, and the Cochrane database was conducted using their online
   library. A set was created using the terms: `traumatic', `nerve', and
   `resonance'.
   The included articles were identified using a computerized search and
   the resulting databases were then sorted according to the inclusion and
   exclusion criteria. This yielded 10,340 articles (MEDLINE, n = 758;
   EMBASE, n = 9564; and Cochrane, n = 18). A search strategy was then
   built by excluding articles that only concern plexus injury and adding
   the terms `neuropathies', `DTI' and `neurotmesis'. In total, seven
   studies were included in the review effectively addressing the role of
   MRI in the evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injury. We extracted
   all relevant information on the imaging findings and the use of magnetic
   resonance in trauma. We did not include technical or specific
   radiological aspects of the imaging techniques.
   These seven articles were subsequently evaluated by analyzing their
   results, methodological approach, and conclusions presented.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess with MRI morphometric
   ultrastructural changes in nerves affected by diabetic peripheral
   neuropathy (DPN). We used an MR micro-neurography imaging protocol and a
   semiautomated technique of tissue segmentation to visualize and measure
   the volume of internal nerve components, such as the epineurium and
   nerve fascicles. The tibial nerves of 16 patients affected by DPN and of
   15 healthy volunteers were imaged. Nerves volume (NV), fascicles volume
   (FV), fascicles to nerve ratio (FNR), and nerves cross-sectional areas
   (CSA) were obtained. In patients with DPN the NV was increased and the
   FNR was decreased, as a result of an increase of the epineurium (FNR in
   diabetic neuropathy 0,665; in controls 0,699,p = 0,040). CSA was
   increased in subjects with DPN ( 12,84mm(2) versus 10,22mm(2),.. =
   0,003). The FV was increased in patients with moderate to severe DPN. We
   have demonstrated structural changes occurring in nerves affected by
   DPN, which otherwise are assessable only with an invasive biopsy. MR
   micro-neurography appears to be suitable for the study of microscopic
   changes in tibial nerves of diabetic patients.}},

Title = {{Volume-Rendered Three-Dimensional Display of the Peripheral Nerves in
   the Wrist Region Using Magnetic Resonance Diffusion Tensor Imaging}},
Journal = {{IRANIAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: In addition to fiber tracking, stereoscopic display of the
   peripheral nerves can be obtained based on magnetic resonance (MR)
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using post-processing methods,
   including volume rendering (VR) and maximum intensity projection (MIP).
   However, sufficient suppression of the image noise remains a challenge.
   Objectives: To achieve three-dimensional (3D) display of the peripheral
   nerves in the wrist region using two post-processing methods for DTI,
   i.e. VR reconstruction for single-direction images and the subtraction
   of unidirectionally encoded images for suppression of heavily isotropic
   objects (SUSHI); to compare the quality of images obtained via the two
   approaches; and to explore their clinical applications.
   Materials and Methods: We performed DTI scans using 6 (DTI6) and 25
   (DTI25) encoding diffusion directions for 20 wrists of 10 healthy adult
   volunteers. We used VR to reconstruct 2 types of images: 1,
   single-direction (anterior-posterior {[}AP] direction) and 2, SUSHI (AP
   direction with the subtraction of the superior-inferior {[}SI]
   direction). The 3D nerve image quality, noise level, and degree of
   noise-removal difficulty were evaluated according to custom evaluation
   scales. The preliminary clinical applications of these methods were
   explored through follow-ups with patients with nerve laceration in the
   wrist region.
   Results: Single-direction VR reconstruction clearly showed the nerves
   for both DTI6 and DTI25 but with obvious noise. In DTI25, VR
   reconstruction for SUSHI showed the nerves clearly with excellent nerve
   signal intensity. In DTI6, SUSHI post-processing lost some ulnar nerve
   signal intensity, resulting in a significant difference in image quality
   scores between single-direction images and SUSHI. Most of the noise was
   removed after SUSHI post-processing.
   Conclusion: VR reconstruction for both single-direction images and SUSHI
   using DTI25 raw data provides excellent 3D displays of the peripheral
   nerves in the wrist region. SUSHI post-processing is a useful denoising
   tool because it automatically reduces the majority of isotropic object
   noise.}},

Abstract = {{Krabbe's disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder
   resulting fromdeficiency of b-galactocerebrosidase that affects
   primarily cerebral white matter and peripheral nerves. Conventional
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to changes in white matter
   myelination, but its assessment is based purely on qualitative, visual
   inspection, and it is subject to interobserver variability and open to
   reader bias. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced MRI technique
   that provides quantitative information about the microscopic structural
   organization of the white matter and changes in cell density
   andmyelination, and it is a suitable MRI tool for studying Krabbe's
   disease. This Review discusses the available studies on the application
   of quantitative DTI analysis to assess white matter changes in patients
   with Krabbe's disease. Quantitative analysis of DTI scalars, especially
   radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, has been shown to be a
   sensitive in vivo biomarker of white matter microstructural damage in
   Krabbe's disease, to detect early white matter injury in asymptomatic
   neonates with Krabbe's disease, to predict motor and cognitive functions
   after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and to serve as a
   measurement for monitoring effects of HSCT on white matter development
   in Krabbe's disease. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Human dorsal-root-ganglion perfusion measured in-vivo by MRI}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{81-87}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop an in-vivo imaging method for the measurement of
   dorsal-root-ganglia-(DRG) perfusion, to establish its normal values in
   patients without known peripheral nerve disorders or radicular pain
   syndromes and to determine the physiological spatial perfusion pattern
   within the DRG.
   Methods: This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics
   committee and written informed consent was obtained from all
   participants. 46 (24 female, 22 male, mean age 46.0 +/- 15.2 years)
   subjects without known peripheral neuropathies or pain syndromes were
   examined by a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom VERIO or TRIO, Siemens AG,
   Erlangen, Germany) with a VIBE
   (Volume-Interpolated-Breathhold-Examination) dynamic-contrast-enhanced
   (DCE) T1-w-sequence (TR/TE 3.3/1.11 ms; 24 slices; voxel resolution 1.3
   x 1.3 x 3.0 mm(3)) covered the pelvis from the upper plate of the 5th
   lumbar vertebra to the 2nd sacral vertebra. Transfer-constant (K-trans)
   and interstitial-volume-fraction (interstitial-leakage-fraction, V-e)
   were modeled for the DRG and spinal nerve by applying the Tofts-model.
   Statistical analyses included pairwise comparisons of L5/S1 DRG vs.
   spinal nerve. Furthermore, distinct physiological zones within the S1
   DRG were compared (cell body rich area (CBRA) vs. nerve fiber rich area
   (NFRA)).
   Results: DRG showed a significantly increased permeability compared to
   spinal nerve (K-trans 3.8 +/- 1.5 10(-3)/min vs. 1.6 +/- 0.9 10 (3)/min,
   p-value: <0.001) combined with an increased interstitial leakage of
   contrast agent into the extravascular-extracellular-space (V-e 38.1 +/-
   19.2\% vs. 17.3 +/- 9.9\%, p-value: <0.001). Parameters showed no
   statistically significant difference on DRG-level (L5 vs. S1; p-value:
   0.62 (K-trans); 0.17 (V-e)) and -side (left vs. right; p-value: 0.25
   (K-trans); 0.79 (V-e)).
   Female gender was associated with a significantly increased permeability
   (K-trans female 4.3 +/- 1.4 10(-3)/min vs. male 3.4 +/- 0.9 10(-3)/min,
   p-value: <0.05) but no statistically significant differences in
   interstitial leakage (V-e female 40.1 +/- 14,1\% vs. male 34.5 +/-
   17.4\%, p-value: 0.24).
   DRG showed distinct spatial distribution patterns of perfusion: Ktrans
   and Vewere significantly higher in the CBRA than in the NFRA (K-trans
   4.4 +/- 1.8 10(-3)/min vs. 1.7 +/- 1.2 10(-3)/min, p-value: <0.001 and
   V-e 40.9 +/- 21.3\% vs. 15.1 +/- 11.7\%, p-value: <0.001).
   Conclusion: Non-invasive and in-vivo measurement of human DRG perfusion
   by MRI is a feasible technique. DRG show substantially higher
   permeability and interstitial leakage than spinal nerves. Even distinct
   physiological perfusion patterns for different microstructural
   compartments could be observed within the DRG. The technique may become
   particularly useful for future research on the poorly understood human
   sensory neuropathies and pain syndromes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{We investigated whether MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of
   the cervical spinal cord could aid the (differential) diagnosis of
   sensory neuronopathies, an underdiagnosed group of diseases of the
   peripheral nervous system.
   We obtained spinal cord DTI and T2WI at 3 T from 28 patients, 14
   diabetic subjects with sensory-motor distal polyneuropathy, and 20
   healthy controls. We quantified DTI-based parameters and looked at the
   hyperintense T2W signal at the spinal cord posterior columns. Fractional
   anisotropy and mean diffusivity values at C2-C3 and C3-C4 levels were
   compared between groups. We also compared average fractional anisotropy
   (mean of values at C2-C3 and C3-C4 levels). A receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine diagnostic accuracy of
   average fractional anisotropy, and we compared its sensitivity against
   the hyperintense signal in segregating patients from the other subjects.
   Mean age and disease duration were 52 +/- 10 and 11.4 +/- 9.3 years in
   the patient group. Eighteen subjects had idiopathic disease and 6
   dysimmune etiology. Fractional anisotropy at C3-C4 level and average
   fractional anisotropy were significantly different between patients and
   healthy controls (p < 0.001 and < 0.001) and between patients and
   diabetic subjects (p = 0.019 and 0.027). Average fractional anisotropy
   presented an area under the curve of 0.838. Moreover, it had higher
   sensitivity than visual detection of the hyperintense signal (0.86 vs.
   0.54), particularly for patients with short disease duration.
   DTI-based analysis enables in vivo detection of posterior column damage
   in sensory neuronopathy patients and is a useful diagnostic test for
   this condition. It also helps the differential diagnosis between sensory
   neuronopathy and distal polyneuropathies.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the microstructural changes in compressed nerves using
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of herniated disc treated with
   percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy.Diffusion tensor
   imaging has been widely used to visualize peripheral nerves, and the
   microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed using DTI.
   However, the microstructural changes after surgery are not
   well-understood in patients with lumbar disc herniation.Thirty-four
   consecutive patients with foraminal disc herniation affecting unilateral
   sacral 1 (S1) nerve roots were enrolled in this study. DTI with
   tractography was performed on S1 nerve roots before and after surgery.
   The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient
   values were calculated from tractography images.In compressed nerve
   roots, the FA value before surgery was significantly lower than that
   after surgery (P=0.000). A significant difference in FA values was found
   between the compressed and normal sides before surgery (P=0.000).
   However, no significant difference was found between the compressed and
   normal sides after surgery (P=0.057). A significant difference in
   apparent diffusion coefficient values was found before and after surgery
   at the compressed side (P=0.023). However, no significant difference was
   found between the compressed and normal sides after surgery (P=0.203).We
   show that the diffusion parameters of compressed nerve roots were not
   significantly different before and after percutaneous transforaminal
   endoscopic discectomy, indicating that the microstructure of the nerve
   root recovered after surgery.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to critically review the clinical approach to
   distinguish the sensory and motor nerve fascicles of the peripheral
   nerve system and to explore potential novel techniques to meet the
   clinical needs. The principles and shortcomings of the currently used
   methods for identification of sensory and motor nerve fascicles,
   including nerve morphology, electrical stimulation, spectroscopy,
   enzymohistochemistry staining (acetylcholinesterase {[}AchE], carbonic
   anhydrase {[}CA] and choline acetyltransferase {[}ChAC] histochemistry
   staining methods), and immunochemical staining were systematically
   reviewed. The progress in diffusion tensor imaging, proteomic
   approaches, and quantum dots (QDs) assessment in clinical applications
   to identify sensory or motor fascicles has been discussed. Traditional
   methods such as physical and enzymohistochemical methods are not
   suitable for the precise differentiation of sensory and motor nerve
   fascicles. Immunohistochemical staining using AchE, CA, and ChAC is
   promising in differentiation of sensory and motor nerve fascicles.
   Diffusion tensor imaging can reflect morphological details of nerve
   fibers. Proteomics can reveal the dynamics of specific proteins
   discriminating sensory and motor fascicles. QDs, with their
   size-dependent optical properties, make them the ideal protein markers
   for identification of the sensory or motor nerves. Diffusion tensor
   imaging, proteomics and QDs-imaging will facilitate the clinical
   identification of motor and sensory nerve fascicles, help in improving
   surgical success rates and assist in postoperative functional recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve imaging is recognized as a complement to clinical and
   neurophysiological assessment in the evaluation of peripheral nerves
   with the ability to impact patient management, even for small and
   difficult nerves. The European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology,
   suggest to use ultrasound (US) for nerve evaluation due to the fact
   that, in sever anatomical area, magnetic resonance imaging is not able
   to give additional informations. US could be considered the first-choice
   approach for the assessment of peripheral nerves. The relative drawback
   of peripheral nerve US is the long learning curve and the deep anatomic
   competence to evaluate even small nerves. In the recent years, the role
   of US in peripheral nerve evaluation has been widened. In the past,
   nerve US was mainly used to assess nervecross sectional area, but now
   more advanced measurements and considerations are desirable and can
   boost the role of peripheral nerve US. Nerve echotexture evaluation was
   defined in 2010: The ratio between the hypoechoic and hyperechoic areas
   of peripheral nerves on US was called ``nerve density{''}. For
   evaluation of patients who have peripheral neuropathies, the role of
   peripheral nerve is US wider than simple cross-sectional area
   evaluation. Quantitative measurements describing the internal fascicular
   echotexture of peripheral nerves introduce the concept of considering US
   as a possible quantitative imaging biomarker technique. The potential of
   nerve US has started to be uncovered. It seems clear that only
   cross-sectional area measurement is no more sufficient for a
   comprehensive US evaluation of peripheral nerves.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has
   shown that fractional anisotropy (FA) is lower in peripheral nerves in
   chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We examined
   whether DTI correlates to muscle strength or impairment.
   MRI of sciatic and tibial nerves was performed on 3-T MR scanner by
   obtaining T2- and DTI-weighted sequences with fat saturation. On each
   slice of T2-weighted (T2w) and DTI, the tibial and sciatic nerves were
   segmented and served for calculation of signal intensity. On DTI images,
   pixel-by-pixel calculation of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient
   (ADC) was done. Muscle strength at knee and ankle was determined by
   isokinetic dynamometry and severity of CIDP by neuropathy impairment
   score (NIS).
   Fourteen CIDP patients treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin were
   compared to gender- and age-matched controls. T2w values expressed as a
   nerve/muscle ratio (nT2w) were unchanged in CIDP versus controls 0.93
   +/- 0.21 versus 1.02 +/- 0.21 (P = 0.10). FA values were lower in CIDP
   compared to controls 0.38 +/- 0.07 versus 0.45 +/- 0.05 (P < 0.0001),
   and ADC values were higher in CIDP versus controls 1735 +/- 232 versus
   1593 +/- 116 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s (P = 0.005). In CIDP, FA values correlated
   to clinical impairment (NIS) (r = -0.57, P = 0.03), but not to muscle
   strength. FA value in the sciatic nerve distinguishes CIDP from controls
   with a sensitivity and a specificity of 92.9 \%.
   CIDP patients have unchanged nT2w values, lower FA values, and higher
   ADC values of sciatic and tibial nerves compared to controls. FA values
   correlated to NIS but were unrelated to muscle strength. DTI of sciatic
   nerves seems promising to differentiate CIDP from controls.}},

Title = {{Nerve Fascicles and Epineurium Volume Segmentation of Peripheral Nerve
   Using Magnetic Resonance Micro-neurography}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1000-1007}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: The aims of this study were to propose a
   semiautomated technique to segment and measure the volume of different
   nerve components of the tibial nerve, such as the nerve fascicles and
   the epineurium, based on magnetic resonance microneurography and a
   segmentation tool derived from brain imaging; and to assess the
   reliability of this method by measuring interobserver and intraobserver
   agreement.
   Materials and Methods: The tibial nerve of 20 healthy volunteers (age
   range = 23-69; mean = 47; standard deviation = 15) was investigated at
   the ankle level. High-resolution images were obtained through tailored
   microneurographic sequences, covering 28 mm of nerve length. Two
   operators manually segmented the nerve using the in-phase image. This
   region of interest was used to mask the nerve in the water image, and
   two-class segmentation was performed to measure the fascicular volume,
   epineurial volume, nerve volume, and fascicular to nerve volume ratio
   (FNR). Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were calculated.
   Results: The nerve structure was clearly visualized with distinction of
   the fascicles and the epineurium. Segmentation provided absolute volumes
   for nerve volume, fascicular volume; and epineurial volume. The mean FNR
   resulted in 0.69 with a standard deviation of 0.04 and appeared to be
   not correlated with age and sex. Interobserver and intraobserver
   agreements were excellent with alpha values >0.9 for each parameter
   investigated, with measurements free of systematic errors at the
   Bland-Altman analysis.
   Conclusions: We concluded that the method is reproducible and the
   parameter FNR is a novel feature that may help in the diagnosis of
   neuropathies detecting changes in volume of the fascicles or the
   epineurium.}},

Title = {{MR neurographic orthopantomogram: Ultrashort echo-time imaging of
   mandibular bone and teeth complemented with high-resolution

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{PurposePanoramical radiographs or cone-beam computed tomography (CT) are
   the standard-of-care in dental imaging to assess teeth, mandible, and
   mandibular canal pathologies, but do not allow assessment of the
   inferior alveolar nerve itself nor of its branches. We propose a new
   technique for MR neurographic orthopantomograms exploiting ultrashort
   echo-time (UTE) imaging of bone and teeth complemented with
   high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography.
   Materials and MethodsThe Institutional Review Board approved the study
   in 10 healthy volunteers. Imaging of the subjects mandibles at 3.0T
   (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens-Healthcare) using a 64-channel head coil with
   isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar reformatting,
   was performed. Bone images were acquired using a 3D PETRA sequence (TE,
   0.07 msec). Morphological nerve imaging was performed using a dedicated
   3D PSIF and 3D SPACE STIR sequence. Functional MR neurography was
   accomplished using a new accelerated diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI)
   prototype sequence (2D SMS-accelerated RESOLVE). Qualitative and
   quantitative image analysis was performed and descriptive statistics are
   provided.
   ResultsImage acquisition and subsequent postprocessing into the MR
   neurographic orthopantomogram by overlay of morphological and functional
   images were feasible in all 10 volunteers without artifacts. All
   mandibular bones and mandibular nerves were assessable and considered
   normal. Fiber tractography with quantitative evaluation of physiological
   diffusion properties of mandibular nerves yielded the following meanSD
   values: fractional anisotropy, 0.43 +/- 0.07; mean diffusivity
   (mm(2)/s), 0.0014 +/- 0.0002; axial diffusivity, 0.0020 +/- 0.0002, and
   radial diffusivity, 0.0011 +/- 0.0001.
   ConclusionThe proposed technique of MR neurographic orthopantomogram
   exploiting UTE imaging complemented with high-resolution morphological
   and functional MR neurography was feasible and allowed comprehensive
   assessment of osseous texture and neural microarchitecture in a single
   examination. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;44:393-400.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the quality of recently
   emerged advanced diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques with
   conventional single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) in a functional
   assessment of lumbar nerve roots.
   Materials and Methods: The institutional review board approved the study
   including 12 healthy volunteers. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed
   at 3 T (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare) with b-values of 0 and 700
   s/mm(2) and an isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar
   reformatting. The nerve roots L2 to S1 were imaged in coronal
   orientation with readout-segmented EPI (rs-DTI) and selective-excitation
   EPI (sTX-DTI) with an acquisition time of 5 minutes each, and in axial
   orientation with single-shot EPI (ss-DTI) with an acquisition time of 12
   minutes (scan parameters as in recent literature). Two independent
   readers qualitatively and quantitatively assessed image quality.
   Results: The interobserver reliability ranged from ``substantial{''} to
   ``almost perfect{''} for all examined parameter and all 3 sequences
   (kappa = 0.70-0.94). Overall image quality was rated higher, and
   artifact levels were scored lower for rs-DTI and sTX-DTI than for ss-DTI
   (P = 0.007-0.027), while fractional anisotropy and signal-to-noise ratio
   values were similar for all sequences (P >= 0.306 and P >= 0.100,
   respectively). Contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly higher for
   rsDTI and ss-DTI than for sTX-DTI (P = 0.004-0.013).
   Conclusions: Despite shorter acquisition times, rs-DTI and sTX-DTI
   produced images of higher quality with smaller geometrical distortions
   than the current standard of reference, ss-DTI. Thus, DTI acquisitions
   in the coronal plane, requiring fewer slices for full coverage of
   exiting nerve roots, may allow for functional neurography in scan times
   suitable for routine clinical practice.}},

   Steady-State T-2 Mapping of the Median Nerve at 7 T Preliminary
   Experience}},
Journal = {{INVESTIGATIVE RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{51}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The aims of this preliminary study were to determine the
   number of axonal bundles (fascicles) in the median nerve, 1 using a
   high-resolution, proton density (PD)-turbo spinecho(TSE) fat suppression
   sequence, and to determine normative T-2 values, measured by triple-echo
   steady state, of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and in patients
   with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), at 7 T.(2)
   Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the local
   ethics committee and conducted between March 2014 and January 2015. All
   study participants gave written informed consent. Six healthy volunteers
   (30 +/- 12 years) and 5 patients with CTS (44 +/- 16 years) were
   included. Measurements were performed on both wrists in all volunteers
   and on the affected wrist in patients (3 right, 2 left). Based on
   5-point scales, 2 readers assessed image quality (1, very poor; 5, very
   good) and the presence of artifacts that might have a possible influence
   on fascicle determination (1, severe artifacts; 5, no artifacts) and
   counted the number of fascicles independently on the PD-TSE sequences.
   Furthermore, T-2 values by region of interest analysis were assessed.
   Student t tests, a hierarchic linear model, and intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ICCs) were used for statistical analysis.
   Results: Proton density-TSE image quality and artifacts revealed a
   median of 5 in healthy volunteers and 4 in patients with CTS for both
   readers. Fascicle count of the median nerve ranged from 13 to 23 in all
   subjects, with an ICC of 0.87 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   0.67-0.95). T-2 values were significantly higher (P = 0.023) in patients
   (24.27 +/- 0.97 milliseconds {[}95\% CI, 22.19-26.38]) compared with
   healthy volunteers (21.01 +/- 0.65 milliseconds {[}95\% CI,
   19.61-22.41]). The ICC for all T-2 values was 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.96-0.98).
   Conclusions: This study shows the possibility of fascicle determination
   of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and patients with CTS
   (although probably less accurately) with high-resolution 7 T magnetic
   resonance imaging, as well as significantly higher T-2 values in
   patients with CTS, which seems to be associated with pathophysiological
   nerve changes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   and T-2 measurements in the evaluation of radiation-induced peripheral
   nerve injury (RIPNI).
   Materials and Methods: RIPNI was produced in a randomly selected side of
   sciatic nerve in each of 21 rabbits while the contralateral side served
   as the control. The limb function and MR parameters were evaluated over
   a 4-month period. Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity
   (lambda(parallel to)), radial diffusivity (lambda(perpendicular to)) and
   T-2 values were obtained using 3T MR for quantitative analysis. Two
   animals were randomly killed for histological evaluation at each
   timepoint.
   Results: The T-2 value of irradiated nerve increased at 1 day (63.95 +/-
   15.60, P = 0.012) and was restored at 1 month (52.34 +/- 5.38, P =
   0.105). It increased progressively at 2 to 4 months (60.39 +/- 10.60,
   66.96 +/- 6.08, 75.51 +/- 7.39, all P < 0.01). lambda(perpendicular to)
   significantly increased at 1 day (0.82 +/- 0.44, P = 0.046) and slightly
   decreased at 1 month (0.61 +/- 0.17, P < 0.001). It increased gradually
   from 2 to 3 months (0.84 +/- 0.29, 1.13 +/- 0.33, both P < 0.001)
   followed by a decline at 4 months (0.83 +/- 0.17, P < 0.001). FA was
   statistically lower than the contralateral sides at 1 to 4 months (0.72
   +/- 0.08, 0.60 +/- 0.12, 0.51 +/- 0.11, 0.62 +/- 0.06, all P < 0.01).
   Changes in FA and lambda(perpendicular to) correlated well with the
   functional and pathological changes in irradiated nerve.
   Conclusion: DTI may be a more sensitive and accurate method to evaluate
   RIPNI compared with T-2 measurements. FA and lambda(perpendicular to)
   are promising quantitative indices in monitoring RIPNI.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: While standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are
   increasingly employed in post-mortem (PM) examinations, more advanced
   techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) remain unexplored in
   forensic sciences. Therefore, we studied the temporal stability and
   reproducibility of DTI and fiber tractography (FT) in non-fixed PM
   subjects. In addition, we investigated the lumbosacral nerves with PMDTI
   and compared their tissue characteristics to in vivo findings.
   Methods: MRI data were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner in seven PM
   subjects, consisting of six nontrauma deaths and one chronic trauma
   death, and in six living subjects. Inter-scan (within one session) and
   inter-session (between days) reproducibility of diffusion parameters,
   fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD), were evaluated
   for the lumbosacral nerves using Bland-Altman and Jones plots. Diffusion
   parameters in nerves L3-S2 were compared to living subjects using the
   non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.
   Results: Reproducibility of diffusion values of inter-scan 95\% limits
   of agreement ranged from -0.058 to 0.062 for FA, and (-0.037 to 0.052) x
   10(-3) mm(2)/s for MD. For the inter-session this was -0.0423 to 0.0423,
   and (-0.0442 to 0.0442) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s for FA, and MD, respectively.
   Although PM subjects showed approximately four-fold lower diffusivity
   values compared to living subjects, FT results were comparable. The
   chronic trauma case showed disorganization and asymmetry of the nerves.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated that DTI was reproducible in characterizing
   nervous tissue properties and FT in reconstructing the architecture of
   lumbosacral nerves in PM subjects. We showed differences in diffusion
   values between PM and in vivo and showed the ability of PMDTI and FT to
   reconstruct nerve lesions in a chronic trauma case. We expect that PMDTI
   and FT may become valuable in identification and documentation of PM
   nerve trauma or pathologies in forensic sciences. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Paresthesia-dominant and pain-dominant subgroups have been noted in
   carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a peripheral neuropathic disorder
   characterized by altered primary somatosensory/motor (S1/M1) physiology.
   We aimed to investigate whether brain morphometry dissociates these
   subgroups. Subjects with CTS were evaluated with nerve conduction
   studies, whereas symptom severity ratings were used to allocate subjects
   into paresthesia-dominant (CTS-paresthesia), pain-dominant (CTS-pain),
   and pain/paresthesia nondominant (not included in further analysis)
   subgroups. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging data were
   acquired at 3T using a multiecho MPRAGE T1-weighted pulse sequence, and
   gray matter cortical thickness was calculated across the entire brain
   using validated, automated methods. CTS-paresthesia subjects
   demonstrated reduced median sensory nerve conduction velocity (P = 0.05)
   compared with CTS-pain subjects. In addition, cortical thickness in
   precentral and postcentral gyri (S1/M1 hand area) contralateral to the
   more affected hand was significantly reduced in CTS-paresthesia subgroup
   compared with CTS-pain subgroup. Moreover, in CTS- paresthesia subjects,
   precentral cortical thickness was negatively correlated with paresthesia
   severity (r(34) = -0.40, P = 0.016) and positively correlated with
   median nerve sensory velocity (r(36) = 0.51, P = 0.001), but not with
   pain severity. Conversely, in CTS-pain subjects, contralesional S1 (r(9)
   = 0.62, P = 0.042) and M1 (r(9) = 0.61, P = 0.046) cortical thickness
   were correlated with pain severity, but not median nerve velocity or
   paresthesia severity. This double dissociation in somatotopically
   specific S1/M1 areas suggests a neuroanatomical substrate for
   symptom-based CTS subgroups. Such fine-grained subgrouping of CTS may
   lead to improved personalized therapeutic approaches, based on superior
   characterization of the linkage between peripheral and central
   neuroplasticity.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo determine the reliability and reproducibility of peripheral
   nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in healthy subjects.
   Materials and MethodsWe assessed the test-retest and interrater
   reliability studies of peripheral nerve DTI in a cohort of 12 healthy
   subjects (mean age 44.0 years, range 26-71 years). Magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) studies were performed on a 3T scanner (MR750, GE
   Healthcare). DTI and T-1-weighted sequences were performed on the tibial
   and peroneal nerves in the knee. Each subject was scanned on three
   separate occasions. Image analyses were performed at two anatomic
   positions: the level of the lateral femoral condyle (position 1), and
   the superior pole of the patella (position 2). Analysis was performed
   using three software packages (raters): FuncTools, FSL, and Diffusion
   Toolkit. Metrics obtained included fractional anisotropy (FA), axial
   diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD).
   ResultsDTI metrics were not significantly different between each
   measurement position, except peroneal nerve AD and tibial nerve RD were
   higher at position 1 (P=0.02 and 0.04, respectively). There was no
   significant difference in DTI metrics between male and female subjects
   (P=0.10-0.99). The test-retest reliability of DTI metrics was high,
   maximal for FA (intraclass correlation coefficient {[}ICC]=0.96). ICC
   values for individual DTI metrics were similar between each measurement
   position, except that tibial nerve AD was significantly higher at
   position 2 (P=0.03). Interrater reliability was also high
   (ICC=0.95-0.96).
   ConclusionWe found peripheral nerve DTI to be reliable and reproducible,
   with few effects related to the postprocessing package used. J. Magn.

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To investigate the longitudinal relationship between
   chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms (sx) and
   brain perfusion changes in patients with breast cancer. Interaction of
   CIPN-sx perfusion effects with known chemotherapy-associated gray matter
   density decrease was also assessed to elucidate the relationship between
   CIPN and previously reported cancer treatment-related brain structural
   changes.
   Methods
   Patients with breast cancer treated with (n - 24) or without (n - 23)
   chemotherapy underwent clinical examination and brain magnetic resonance
   imaging at the following three time points: before treatment (baseline),
   1 month after treatment completion, and 1 year after the 1-month
   assessment. CIPN-sx were evaluated with the self-reported Functional
   Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity
   four-item sensory-specific scale. Perfusion and gray matter density were
   assessed using voxel-based pulsed arterial spin labeling and
   morphometric analyses and tested for association with CIPN-sx in the
   patients who received chemotherapy.
   Results
   Patients who received chemotherapy reported significantly increased
   CIPN-sx from baseline to 1 month, with partial recovery by 1 year (P <
   .001). CIPN-sx increase from baseline to 1 month was significantly
   greater for patients who received chemotherapy compared with those who
   did not (P = .001). At 1 month, neuroimaging showed that for the group
   that received chemotherapy, CIPN-sx were positively associated with
   cerebral perfusion in the right superior frontal gyrus and cingulate
   gyrus, regions associated with pain processing (P,.001). Longitudinal
   magnetic resonance imaging analysis in the group receiving chemotherapy
   indicated that CIPN-sx and associated perfusion changes from baseline to
   1 month were also positively correlated with gray matter density change
   (P < .005).
   Conclusion
   Peripheral neuropathy symptoms after systemic chemotherapy for breast
   cancer are associated with changes in cerebral perfusion and gray
   matter. The specific mechanisms warrant further investigation given the
   potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications. (C) 2015 by American

Abstract = {{Objectives: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can provide structural
   information and objective values for nerves. The aims of this study were
   to perform quantitative evaluation and fibre tracking of the normal
   inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) using DTI on 3.0-T MRI.
   Methods: DTI was applied to 92 IANs of 46 healthy volunteers. Circular
   regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on three different positions at
   the mandibular foramen, second molar and mental foramen of each nerve on
   apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA)
   maps, and the ADC and FA of each ROI were measured. Differences in the
   values arising from the nerve positions were evaluated. Furthermore,
   fibre tracking of the IANs was performed by tractography, and the
   quality of visualization was evaluated.
   Results: There were no significant differences in the ADC and FA between
   the right and left sides regardless of the anteroposterior positions.
   Regarding differences arising from the anteroposterior measurement
   positions, the ADC and FA showed no significant differences (p > 0.017),
   except for the ADCs between the positions at the mandibular foramen and
   mental foramen in the left side (p = 0.0068). Overall, 70 (76\%) of the
   92 IANs could be visualized fully or partially by tractography.
   Conclusions: The ADC and FA of the IAN were successfully obtained from
   healthy volunteers using DTI and were confirmed to be symmetrical
   regardless of the measurement positions. DTI is a feasible technique for
   the quantitative evaluation and visualization of the IAN.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study reports on a patient who developed degeneration
   of an injured spinothalamic tract (STT) detected on diffusion tensor
   tractography (DTT) following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).Case
   description: A 56-year-old female had suffered from head trauma
   resulting from a pedestrian car accident. The patient did not experience
   loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia and the patient's
   Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. She had begun to feel pain in her left
   hand and foot at similar to 7 days after onset. The characteristics and
   severity of pain were as follows: constant tingling and pricking
   sensation without allodynia or hyperalgesia (Visual Analogue Scale
   score: 3 similar to 4). No specific focal lesion was observed on brain
   and spine MRI and an electromyography study showed no evidence of
   peripheral nerve injury or radiculopathy. At 6 months after onset, the
   central pain in the left hand and foot became aggravated, with a Visual
   Analogue Scale score of 6.Results: On 1-month DTT, partial tearing was
   observed in both STTs. In contrast, both partially torn STTs had become
   atrophy on 9-month DTT.Conclusions: This study recommends further
   studies conducted on the prognosis (regeneration or degeneration) of
   injured STTs and on the effect of change of an injured STT on central
   pain.}},

   on MR Diffusion Tensor Imaging with Multiple Post-Processing Methods}},
Journal = {{IRANIAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Peripheral nerves at the elbow region are prone to
   entrapment neuropathies and injuries. To make accurate assessment,
   clinicians need stereoscopic display of the nerves to observe them at
   all angles.
   Objectives: To obtain a stereoscopic display of the peripheral nerves at
   the elbow region based on magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) data using three post-processing methods of volume
   rendering (VR), maximum intensity projection (MIP), and fiber
   tractography, and to evaluate the difference and correlation between
   them.
   Subjects and Methods: Twenty-four elbows of 12 healthy young volunteers
   were assessed by 20 encoding diffusion direction MR DTI scans. Images
   belonging to a single direction (anterior-posterior direction,
   perpendicular to the nerve) were subjected to VR and MIP reconstruction.
   All raw DTI data were transferred to the Siemens MR workstation for
   fiber tractography post-processing. Imaging qualities of fiber
   tractography and VR/MIP were evaluated by two observers independently
   based on a custom evaluation scale.
   Results: Stereoscopic displays of the nerves were obtained in all 24
   elbows by VR, MIP, and fiber tractography post-processing methods. The
   VR/MIP post-processing methods were easier to perform compared to fiber
   tractography. There was no significant difference among the scores of
   fiber tracking and VR/MIP reconstruction for single direction. The
   imaging quality scores of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were
   significantly correlated based on intraclass correlation coefficient
   (ICC) analysis (ICC ranged 0.709-0.901), which suggested that the scores
   based on fiber tractography and VR/MIP for the same sample were
   consistent. Inter-and intraobserver agreements were good to excellent.
   Conclusion: Stereoscopic displays of the peripheral nerves at the elbow
   region can be achieved by using VR, MIP, and fiber tracking
   post-processing methods based on raw DTI images. VR and MIP
   reconstruction could be used as preview tools before fiber tracking to
   determine whether the raw images are satisfactory.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{234-241}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Epineural scar formation is one of the most significant
   negative factors affecting surgical repair after peripheral nerve
   injury. The scar tissue mechanically hinders axonal regeneration and
   causes adhesions between nerves and surrounding tissues. A hemostatic
   agent Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS; Immun Gida Ilac Kozmetik San. ve Tic.
   Ltd. Sti., Istanbul, Turkey) has not been previously used. Decreasing
   the postoperative bleeding and adhesions between nerve and surrounding
   tissues will prevent the formation of scar tissue, as well as
   corresponding compressive neuropathy and/or deceleration of axonal
   regeneration. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate
   the effects of bleeding on nerve healing and scar tissue after repair of
   peripheral nerve injuries.
   Methods: The right sciatic nerve of 30 Sprague-Dawley male rats
   (weighing 260-330 g) was cut 1.5 cm proximal to the trifurcation and
   repaired primarily with 8/0 sutures using epineural technique. The rats
   were then divided into 3 groups. Saline was applied in Group 1 (n=10),
   ABS in Group 2 (n=10), and heparin in Group 3 (n=10) for 5 minutes to
   the repair site and surrounding tissues. In each group,
   electrophysiological measurements were performed with electromyography
   (EMG) at postoperative week 12. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor
   imaging was used at week 12. Macroscopical and histopathological
   evaluations were conducted after sacrificing the rats at week 24 with
   total excision of the repaired sciatic nerves and surrounding tissues.
   Results: The ABS and saline groups showed better healing than the
   heparin group. The ABS and saline groups were better in the
   histopathologic evaluations, but there was no statistically significant
   difference between the 2 groups.
   Conclusion: Statistically significant differences were not found between
   the 3 groups. Significant results may be obtained with larger studies.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionSpinal cord and peripheral nerves are classically known to
   be damaged in Friedreich's ataxia, but the extent of cerebral
   involvement in the disease and its progression over time are not yet
   characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate longitudinally
   cerebral damage in Friedreich's ataxia
   MethodsWe enrolled 31 patients and 40 controls, which were evaluated at
   baseline and after 1 and 2 years. To assess gray matter, we employed
   voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness measurements. White
   matter was evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging. Statistical
   analyses were both cross-sectional and longitudinal (corrected for
   multiple comparisons).
   ResultsGroup comparison between patients and controls revealed
   widespread macrostructural differences at baseline: gray matter atrophy
   in the dentate nuclei, brainstem, and precentral gyri; and white matter
   atrophy in the cerebellum and superior cerebellar peduncles, brainstem,
   and periventricular areas. We did not identify any longitudinal
   volumetric change over time. There were extensive microstructural
   alterations, including superior cerebellar peduncles, corpus callosum,
   and pyramidal tracts. Longitudinal analyses identified progressive
   microstructural abnormalities at the corpus callosum, pyramidal tracts,
   and superior cerebellar peduncles after 1 year of follow-up.
   ConclusionPatients with Friedreich's ataxia present more widespread gray
   and white matter damage than previously reported, including not only
   infratentorial areas, but also supratentorial structures. Furthermore,
   patients with Friedreich's ataxia have progressive microstructural
   abnormalities amenable to detection in a short-term follow-up. (c) 2015

   case of a 30-year old female patient with complex autosomal recessive
   HSP with thinning of the corpus callosum (TCC) and dementia that was
   compound heterozygous with two novel mutations in the SPG11 gene.
   Sequence analysis of the SPG11 gene revealed two novel mutations in a
   compound heterozygous state in the index patient (c.2431C>T/p.Gln811Ter
   and c.6755\_6756insT/p.Glu2252Aspfs{*}88). MRI showed abnormal TCC,
   white matter (WM) hyperintensities periventricularly, and the `ears of
   the lynx' sign. Diffusion tensor imaging showed a mild-to-moderate
   decrease in fractional anisotropy and an increase in mean diffusivity in
   WM compared to age-matched controls, while magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy showed abnormal findings in affected WM with a decrease in

Abstract = {{Introduction: We investigated the applicability of nerve ultrasound and
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating
   polyneuropathy (CIDP).
   Methods: We systematically examined several nerves with ultrasound and
   the lumbar roots and tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa of nine CIDP
   patients with MRI additionally to the nerve conduction studies.
   Results: Patients with overall disability sum score (ODSS) 2-3 were
   characterised by normal fascicular structure in MRI and ultrasound.
   Patients with higher ODSS showed isolated enlarged fascicles and
   increased cross sectional area (CSA) of the peripheral nerves and of the
   diameter of the cauda equina and L5 root, whereas two of them showed
   atrophic fascicles in both imaging techniques.
   Conclusions: Nerve ultrasound and MRI findings show the same
   morphological fascicle alterations in peripheral nerves in correlation
   to ODSS. Nerve ultrasound as an affordable tool, easy and quick to
   perform, could replace MRI in daily routine for monitoring peripheral
   nerve morphology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of previous studies on hereditary neuropathy with liability
   to pressure palsies (HNPP) were focused on peripheral nerves, whereas
   cerebral alterations in HNPP have been less attended to. In this work,
   Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to detect the changes in WM,
   especially in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in HNPP patients
   for its sensitivity in probing the microstructure of WM, the sensitive
   metric was searched for probing cerebral alterations and the regional
   distribution of cerebral abnormalities was identified. Twelve HNPP
   patients and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent the
   conventional MRI, DTI scan, and electrophysiological examination. The
   conventional MRI images were first analyzed to identify abnormal intense
   regions and the NAWM regions. NAWM refers to the white matter regions
   that do not include the lesions on conventional MRI. The apparent
   diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the NAWM
   were then measured and compared between patient and control groups. The
   sensitivity and specificity of 3 methods and the cerebral regional
   distribution of MR signal abnormalities were further analyzed.
   Hyperintense foci were observed on T2 weighted image and fluid
   attenuated inversion recovery images in 6 patients. Compared to the
   controls, FA values of the patients were significantly lower in
   bilateral frontal, orbitofrontal, and temporal NAWMs; whereas the
   electrophysiological examination results of patients and controls
   exhibited no statistically significant difference. The sensitivity of FA
   value was higher than that of electrophysiological examination and
   conventional MRI. The majority of abnormal signals on conventional MRI
   images and abnormal FA values were located in the frontal and temporal
   lobes. The results of our study show cerebral WM changes in HNPP
   patients. FA value in DTI has been shown to be sensitive to the cerebral
   microstructural changes in HNPP. The frontal lobe is the predilection
   site that is most involved in HNPP.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnosis and management of peripheral nerve injury is complicated by
   the inability to assess microstructural features of injured nerve fibers
   via clinical examination and electrophysiology. Diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) has been shown to accurately detect nerve injury and regeneration
   in crush models of peripheral nerve injury, but no prior studies have
   been conducted on nerve transection, a surgical emergency that can lead
   to permanent weakness or paralysis. Acute sciatic nerve injuries were
   performed microsurgically to produce multiple grades of nerve
   transection in rats that were harvested 1 hour after surgery.
   High-resolution diffusion tensor images from ex vivo sciatic nerves were
   obtained using diffusion-weighted spin-echo acquisitions at 4.7 T.
   Fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced at the injury sites of
   transected rats compared with sham rats. Additionally, minor eigenvalues
   and radial diffusivity were profoundly elevated at all injury sites and
   were negatively correlated to the degree of injury. Diffusion tensor
   tractography showed discontinuities at all injury sites and
   significantly reduced continuous tract counts. These findings
   demonstrate that high-resolution DTI is a promising tool for acute
   diagnosis and grading of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries.

Title = {{Visualization of nerve fibers and their relationship to peripheral nerve
   tumors by diffusion tensor imaging}},
Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{OBJECT The majority of growing and/or symptomatic peripheral nerve
   tumors are schwannomas and neurofibromas. They are almost always benign
   and can usually be resected while minimizing motor and sensory deficits
   if approached with the proper expertise and techniques. Intraoperative
   electrophysiological stimulation and recording techniques allow the
   surgeon to map the surface of the tumor in an effort to identify and
   thus avoid damaging functioning nerve fibers. Recently, MR diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) techniques have permitted the visualization of
   axons, because of their anisotropic properties, in peripheral nerves.
   The object of this study was to compare the distribution of nerve fibers
   as revealed by direct electrical stimulation with that seen on
   preoperative MR DTI.
   METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of patients
   with a peripheral nerve or nerve root tumor between March 2012 and
   January 2014. Diffusion tensor imaging and intraoperative data had been
   prospectively collected for patients with peripheral nerve tumors that
   were resected. Preoperative identification of the nerve fiber location
   in relation to the nerve tumor surface as seen on DTI studies was
   compared with the nerve fiber's intraoperative localization using
   electrophysiological stimulation and recordings.
   RESULTS In 23 patients eligible for study there was good correlation
   between nerve fiber location on DTI and its anatomical location seen
   intraoperatively. Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated the relationship
   of nerve fibers relative to the tumor with 95.7\% sensitivity, 66.7\%
   specificity, 75\% positive predictive value, and 93.8\% negative
   predictive value.
   CONCLUSIONS Preoperative DTI techniques are useful in helping the
   peripheral nerve surgeon to both determine the risks involved in
   resecting a nerve tumor and plan the safest surgical approach.

Abstract = {{Successful management of peripheral nerve trauma relies on accurate
   localization of the injury and grading of the severity of nerve injury
   to determine whether surgical intervention is required. Existing
   techniques, such as electrodiagnostic studies and conventional imaging
   modalities, provide important information, but are limited by being
   unable to distinguish severe nerve lesions in continuity that will
   recover from those that will not. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
   tractography of peripheral nerves provide a novel technique to localize
   and grade nerve injury, by assessing the integrity of the nerve fibers
   across the site of nerve injury. Diffusion tensor imaging and
   tractography also hold promise as markers of early nerve regeneration,
   prior to clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of recovery. In the
   present review, the techniques of peripheral nerve DTI and tractography
   are discussed with respect to peripheral nerve trauma, with illustrative
   cases demonstrating potential roles of these novel approaches.

Title = {{Diffusion tensor tractography for the surgical management of peripheral
   nerve sheath tumors}},
Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{OBJECT Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) are uncommon but bear a
   significant risk of malignancy. High-resolution MRI is the standard
   technique for characterizing PNSTs. However, planning the appropriate
   extent of resection and subsequent reconstructive strategies is highly
   dependent on the intraoperative findings because preoperative MRI
   evaluation can be insufficient. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT)
   represents a recently developed advanced MRI technique that reveals the
   microstructure of tissues based on monitoring the random movement of
   water molecules. DTT has the potential to provide diagnostic insights
   beyond conventional MRI techniques due to its mapping of specific
   fibrillar nerve structures. Here, DTT was applied to evaluate PNSTs and
   to examine the usefulness of this method for the correct delineation of
   tumor and healthy nerve tissue and the value of this information in the
   preoperative planning of surgical interventions.
   METHODS In this prospective study, patients with the clinical symptoms
   of a PNST were investigated using DTT 3-Tesla MRI scans. Image data
   processing and tractography were performed using the FACT (fiber
   assessment by continuous tracking) algorithm and
   multiple-regions-of-interest approach. The surgical findings were then
   compared with the results of the DTT MRI scans. Preoperative fascicle
   visualization and the correlation with the intraoperative findings were
   graded.
   RESULTS In a 21-month period, 12 patients with PNSTs were investigated
   (7 female and 5 male patients with a mean age of 46.2 +/- 19.2 years).
   All patients underwent surgical removal of the tumor. Schwannoma was the
   most common benign histopathological finding (n = 7), whereas 2
   malignant lesions were detected. In 10 of 12 patients, good preoperative
   nerve fascicle visualization was achieved using DTT scans. In 9 of 10
   patients with good preoperative fascicle visualization, good
   intraoperative correlation between the DTT scans and surgical anatomy
   was found.
   CONCLUSIONS DTT properly visualizes the peripheral nerve fascicles and
   their correct anatomical relation to PNST. DTT represents a promising
   new method for the preinterventional planning of nerve tumor resection.

   ultrasound of peripheral nerve tumors and tumorlike lesions}},
Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The diagnostic workup and surgical therapy for peripheral nerve tumors
   and tumorlike lesions are challenging. Magnetic resonance imaging is the
   standard diagnostic tool in the preoperative workup. However, even with
   advanced pulse sequences such as diffusion tensor imaging for MR
   neurography, the ability to differentiate tumor entities based on
   histological features remains limited. In particular, rare tumor
   entities different from schwannomas and neurofibromas are difficult to
   anticipate before surgical exploration and histological confirmation.
   High-resolution ultrasound (HRU) has become another important tool in
   the preoperative evaluation of peripheral nerves. Ongoing software and
   technical developments with transducers of up to 17-18 MHz enable high
   spatial resolution with tissue-differentiating properties.
   Unfortunately, high-frequency ultrasound provides low tissue
   penetration. The authors developed a setting in which intraoperative HRU
   was used and in which the direct sterile contact between the ultrasound
   transducer and the surgically exposed nerve pathology was enabled to
   increase structural resolution and contrast. In a case-guided fashion,
   the authors report the sonographic characteristics of rare tumor
   entities shown by intraoperative HRU and contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

Pages = {{498-504}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   The aim of this study was to determine whether quantitative diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) adds diagnostic accuracy in magnetic resonance
   neurography.
   Materials and Methods
   This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board.
   We enrolled 16 patients with peripheral polyneuropathy of various
   etiologies involving the upper arm and 30 healthy controls. Magnetic
   resonance neurography was performed at 3 T using transverse T2-weighted
   (T2-w) turbo spin echo and spin echo planar imaging diffusion-weighted
   sequences. T2-weighted normalized signal (nT2), fractional anisotropy
   (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), radial diffusivity (RD), and
   axial diffusivity (AD) of the median, ulnar, and radial nerves were
   quantified after manual segmentation. Diagnostic performance of each
   separate parameter and combinations of parameters was assessed using the
   area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Bootstrap
   validation was used to adjust for potential overfitting.
   Results
   Average nT2, ADC, RD, and AD values of the median, ulnar, and radial
   nerve were significantly increased in neuropathy patients compared with
   that in healthy controls (nT2, 1.49 +/- 0.05 vs 1.05 +/- 0.05; ADC, 1.4
   x 10(-3) +/- 2.8 x 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 1.1 x 10(-3) +/- 1.3 x 10(-5)
   mm(2)/s; RD, 9.5 x 10(-4) +/- 2.9 x 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 7.2 x 10(-4) +/-
   1.3 x 10(-5) mm(2)/s; AD, 2.3 x 10(-3) +/- 3.7 x 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 2.0 x
   10(-3) +/- 2.2 x 10(-5) mm(2)/s; P < 0.001 for all comparisons).
   Fractional anisotropy values were significantly decreased in patients
   (0.51 +/- 0.01 vs 0.59 +/- 0.01; P < 0.001). T2-weighted normalized
   signal and DTI parameters had comparable diagnostic accuracy (adjusted
   AUC: T2-w, 0.92; FA, 0.88; ADC, 0.89; AD, 0.84; RD, 0.86). Combining DTI
   parameters significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy over
   single-parameter analysis. In addition, the combination of nT2 with DTI
   parameters yielded excellent adjusted AUCs up to 0.97 (nT2 + FA).
   Conclusions
   Diffusion tensor imaging has high diagnostic accuracy in peripheral
   neuropathy. Combining DTI with T2 can outperform T2-w imaging alone and
   provides added value in magnetic resonance neurography.}},

Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) are widely used in the evaluation of the central nervous
   system and recently have been reported as a potential tool for diagnosis
   of the peripheral nerve or the lumbar nerve entrapment. The purpose of
   this study was to evaluate consecutive changes in apparent diffusion
   coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of normal lumbar
   nerve roots from the junction of the dura mater.
   Methods: The lumbar spinal nerves were examined in 6 male healthy
   volunteers (mean age, 35 years) with no experiences of sciatica, with a
   3.0-T MR unit using a five-element phased-array surface coil. DTI was
   performed with the following imaging parameters: 11084.6/73.7 ms for
   TR/TE; b-value, 800 s/mm2; MPG, 33 directions; slice thickness, 1.5 mm;
   and total scan time, 7 min 35 s. ADC and FA values at all consecutive
   points along the L4, L5 and S1 nerves were quantified on every 1.5 mm
   slice from the junction of the dura mater using short fiber tracking.
   Results: ADC values of all L4, 5, and S1 nerve roots decreased linearly
   up to 15 mm from the dura junction and was constant distally afterward.
   ADC values in the proximal portion demonstrated S1 > L5 > L4 (p < 0.05).
   On the other hand, FA values increased linearly up to 15 mm from the
   dura junction, and was constant distally afterward. FA values in the
   proximal portion showed L4 > L5 > S1 (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that ADC and FA values of each L4, 5,
   and S1 at the proximal portion from the junction of the dura matter
   changed linearly. It would be useful to know the normal profile of DTI
   values by location of each nerve root so that we can detect subtle
   abnormalities in each nerve root.}},

Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   parameters as in-vivo biomarkers of axon and myelin sheath integrity of
   the median nerve in the carpal tunnel as validated by correlation with
   electrophysiology.
   Methods
   MRI examinations at 3T including DTI were conducted on wrists in 30
   healthy subjects. After manual segmentation of the median nerve
   quantitative analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as axial,
   radial and mean diffusivity (AD, RD, and MD) was carried out. Pairwise
   Pearson correlations with electrophysiological parameters comprising
   sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and compound muscle action
   potential (CMAP) as markers of axon integrity, and distal motor latency
   (dml) and sensory nerve conduction velocity (sNCV) as markers of myelin
   sheath integrity were computed. The significance criterion was set at
   P=0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons.
   Results
   DTI parameters showed a distinct proximal-to-distal profile with FA, MD,
   and RD extrema coinciding in the center of the carpal tunnel. AD
   correlated with CMAP (r=0.50, p=0.04, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers
   of myelin sheath integrity. RD correlated with sNCV (r=-0.53, p=0.02,
   Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of axon integrity. FA correlated with
   dml (r=-0.63, p=0.002, Bonf. corr.) and sNCV (r=0.68, p= 0.001, Bonf.
   corr.) but not with markers of axon integrity.
   Conclusion
   AD reflects axon integrity, while RD (and FA) reflect myelin sheath
   integrity as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. DTI
   parameters consistently indicate a slight decrease of structural
   integrity in the carpal tunnel as a physiological site of median nerve
   entrapment. DTI is particularly sensitive, since these findings are
   observed in healthy participants. Our results encourage future studies
   to evaluate the potential of DTI in differentiating axon from myelin
   sheath injury in patients with manifest peripheral neuropathies.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the potential of three-tesla diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) and tractography to detect changes of the radial (RN) and
   median (MN) nerves during transient upper arm compression by a silicon
   ring tourniquet.
   Axial T2-weighted and DTI sequences (b = 700 s/mm(2), 16 gradient
   encoding directions) of 13 healthy volunteers were obtained. Fractional
   anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the
   MN and RN were measured at the spiral groove and further visualized in
   3D by deterministic tractography (thresholds: FA = .15, angle change =
   27A degrees).
   Local/lesional RN FA values increased (p = 0.001) and ADC values
   decreased (p = 0.02) during a 20-min upper arm compression, whereas no
   significant FA (p = 0.49) or ADC (p = 0.73) changes of the MN were
   detected. There were no T2-w nerve signal changes or alterations of
   nerve trajectories in 3D.
   Acute nerve compression of the RN leads to changes of its three-tesla
   DTI metrics. Peripheral nerve DTI provides non-invasive insights into
   the ``selective{''} vulnerability of the RN at the spiral groove.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To achieve 3-dimensional (3D) display of peripheral nerves
   in the wrist region by using maximum intensity projection (MIP)
   post-processing methods to reconstruct raw images acquired by a
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan, and to explore its clinical
   applications.
   Methods: We performed DTI scans in 6 (DTI6) and 25 (DTI25) diffusion
   directions on 20 wrists of 10 healthy young volunteers, 6 wrists of 5
   patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, 6 wrists of 6 patients with nerve
   lacerations, and one patient with neurofibroma. The MIP post-processing
   methods employed 2 types of DTI raw images: (1) single-direction and (2)
   T-2-weighted trace. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent
   diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median and ulnar nerves were
   measured at multiple testing sites. Two radiologists used custom
   evaluation scales to assess the 3D nerve imaging quality independently.
   Results: In both DTI6 and DTI25, nerves in the wrist region could be
   displayed clearly by the 2 MIP post-processing methods. The FA and ADC
   values were not significantly different between DTI6 and DTI25, except
   for the FA values of the ulnar nerves at the level of pisiform bone (p =
   0.03). As to the imaging quality of each MIP post-processing method,
   there were no significant differences between DTI6 and DTI25 (p > 0.05).
   The imaging quality of single-direction MIP post-processing was better
   than that from T2-weighted traces (p < 0.05) because of the higher nerve
   signal intensity.
   Conclusions: Three-dimensional displays of peripheral nerves in the
   wrist region can be achieved by MIP post-processing for single-direction
   images and T-2-weighted trace images for both DTI6 and DTI25. The FA and
   ADC values of the median nerves can be accurately measured by using DTI6
   data. Adopting 6-direction DTI scan and MIP post-processing is an
   efficient method for evaluating peripheral nerves. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is hallmarked by degeneration of small
   unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers in the skin. Traditionally, it has
   been considered as a pure disorder of the peripheral nervous system.
   Nevertheless, previous work found that dysfunction of skin nerves led to
   abnormal recruitment of pain-related regions, suggesting that the brain
   may be affected in SFN. This report combined structural and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to identify structural and functional changes
   in the brain of 19 patients With SFN compared with 17 healthy controls.
   We applied tensor-based morphometry to detect brain structural
   alterations in SFN. Greater volume reduction in pain-processing regions,
   particularly the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices (ACCs), was
   associated with greater depletion of intraepidermal nerve fibers, a
   pathological biomarker of skin nerve degeneration. Based on the
   hypothesis that structural alterations in the pain-processing regions
   might impair their functional connectivity, we further applied
   psychophysiological interaction analysis to assess functional
   connectivity of the ACCs during noxious heat stimulation. There was
   significant reduction in functional connectivity from the ACCs to the
   limbic areas (the parahippocampal gyrus and the posterior cingulate
   cortex), pain-processing area (the insula), and visuospatial areas (the
   cuneus). Moreover, the degree of reduction in functional connectivity
   for the ACCs to the amygdala and the precuneus was linearly correlated
   with the severity of intraepidermal nerve fiber depletion. Our findings
   suggest that SFN is not a pure peripheral nervous system disorder. The
   pain-related brain networks tend to break into functionally independent
   components, with severity linked to the degree of skin nerve
   degeneration.}},

   improved assessment of brachial plexus lesions, thereby improving
   patient care. In this article we describe various MRI techniques for the
   evaluation of the brachial plexus obtained at 1.5 T and 3 T, and we
   explain differences and similarities between sequences and protocols
   performed on MRI equipment from different vendors. The main
   characteristics of pathologic conditions affecting the brachial plexus
   are discussed and illustrated, as well as their differential diagnoses,
   with an emphasis on key imaging findings and relevance for patient
   management. Pitfalls related to suboptimal technique and image

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a powerful MR imaging technique that
   can be used to probe the microstructural environment of highly
   anisotropic tissues such as peripheral nerves. DTI has been used
   predominantly in the central nervous system, and its application in the
   peripheral nervous system does pose some challenges related to imaging
   artifacts, the small caliber of peripheral nerves, and low water proton
   density. However advances in MRI hardware and software have made it
   possible to use the technique in the peripheral nervous system and to
   obtain functional data relating to the effect of pathologic processes on
   peripheral nerves. This article reviews the imaging principles behind
   DTI and examines the literature regarding its application in assessing

Abstract = {{The stress system provides integration of both neurochemical and somatic
   physiologic functions within organisms as an adaptive mechanism to
   changing environmental conditions throughout evolution. In mammals and
   primates the complexity and sophistication of these systems have
   surpassed other species in triaging neurochemical and physiologic
   signaling to maximize chances of survival. Corticotropin releasing
   hormone (CRH) and its related peptides and receptors have been
   identified over the last three decades and are fundamental molecular
   initiators of the stress response. They are crucial in the top down
   regulatory cascade over a myriad of neurochemical, neuroendocrine and
   sympathetic nervous system events. From neuroscience, we've seen that
   stress activation impacts behavior, endocrine and somatic physiology and
   influences neurochemical events that one can capture in real time with
   current imaging technologies. To delineate these effects one can
   demonstrate how the CRH neuronal networks infiltrate critical cognitive,
   emotive and autonomic regions of the central nervous system (CNS) with
   somatic effects. Abundant predinical and clinical studies show
   inter-regulatory actions of CRH with multiple
   neurotransmitters/peptides. Stress, both acute and chronic has
   epigenetic effects which magnify genetic susceptibilities to alter
   neurochemistry; stress system activation can add critical variables in
   design and interpretation of basic and clinical neuroscience and related
   research. This review will attempt to provide an overview of the
   spectrum of known functions and speculative actions of CRH and stress
   responses in light of imaging technology and its interpretation.
   Metabolic and neuroreceptor positron emission/single photon tomography
   (PET/SPECT), fiinctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), anatomic
   MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (pMRS) are technologies that can delineate basic mechanisms
   of neurophysiology and pharmacology. Stress modulates the myriad of
   neurochemical and networks within and controlled through the central and
   peripheral nervous system and the effects of stress activation on
   imaging will be highlighted. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI)
   study aimed to clarify the relationship of peripheral nerves and soft
   tissue tumors (STTs) in 3D to optimize subsequent treatment. Methods:
   Twenty-six consecutive STT patients (histologically malignant, n=10;
   intermediate, n=3; and benign, n=13) underwent 3-Tesla MRI using an
   echoplanar DTI sequence. Deterministic tractography was performed.
   Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured within peritumoral and
   distant regions of interest. Results: Tractography depicted the 3D
   course of the sciatic (n=12), femoral (n=2), tibial (n=7), fibular
   (n=2), median (n=1), musculocutaneous (n=1), and ulnar (n=1) nerves in a
   regular (n=8 of 18, 44.4\%) or thinned (n=7 of 18, 38.9\%) fashion. The
   lowest peritumoral FA values, abrupt thinning, and/or complete
   discontinuity of trajectories were found in 2 cases with histologically
   proven tumoral nerve infiltration. Conclusions: DTI clarifies the 3D
   topography between major peripheral nerves and STTs and may be helpful
   in the assessment of peripheral nerve infiltration by malignant tumors.

Abstract = {{Objective:To evaluate the ultrasound (US) characteristics of peripheral
   nerves in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy
   (CIDP) and their correlations with electrodiagnostic (EDX)
   characteristics.Methods:Nineteen patients with CIDP and 19 healthy
   controls matched by age and body mass index were included in a blind
   case-control, observational study. All patients underwent a neurologic
   examination (including inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment
   {[}INCAT] and Medical Research Council {[}MRC] sum score) and an EDX
   study. Each patient and each control underwent a US study of 14 nerve
   segments, yielding a total number of 266 segments scanned in each
   group.Results:US changes, characterized by an increased nerve
   cross-sectional area (NCSA), were detected in 53\% of the 266 patient
   nerve segments. Mean NCSA was higher in nerve segments of patients than
   in those of controls (p < 0.001). Nerve segments with abnormal US
   belonged to patients with longer disease duration, lower MRC sum score,
   higher INCAT score, and progressive disease form (all p < 0.0001). All
   the aforementioned variables were independently associated with the
   occurrence of US changes. Motor nerve conduction was significantly lower
   in nerve segments with increased NCSA than in those with normal NCSA (p
   < 0.0001). NCSA in segments with prevalent myelin damage was higher than
   that in segments with prevalent axonal damage (p = 0.001) or in segments
   with normal EDX characteristics (p < 0.0001). NCSA and motor nerve
   conduction velocity were inversely correlated in nerve segments with EDX
   evidence of myelin damage (R = 0.599; p < 0.0001). Conduction blocks
   were associated with increased NCSA (p = 0.001).Conclusions:US may,
   similar to MRI, have a supporting role in the diagnosis of CIDP. US and
   EDX changes are correlated.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulated evidence from experimental animal models suggests that
   neuronal loss within the dorsal horn is involved in the development
   and/or maintenance of peripheral neuropathic pain. However, to date, no
   study has specifically investigated whether such neuro-anatomical
   changes also occur at this level in humans. Using brain imaging
   techniques, we sought to determine whether anatomical changes were
   present in the spinal trigeminal nucleus in subjects with chronic
   orofacial neuropathic pain. In 22 subjects with painful trigeminal
   neuropathy and 44 pain-free controls, voxel-based morphometry of
   T1-weighted anatomical images and diffusion tensor images were used to
   assess regional gray matter volume and microstructural changes within
   the brainstem. In addition, deterministic tractography was used to
   assess the integrity of ascending pain pathways. Orofacial neuropathic
   pain was associated with significant regional gray matter volume
   decreases, fractional anisotropy increases, and mean diffusivity
   decreases within the spinal trigeminal nucleus, specifically the
   subnucleus oralis. In addition, tractography revealed no significant
   differences in diffusivity properties in the root entry zone of the
   trigeminal nerve, the spinal trigeminal tract, or the ventral
   trigeminothalamic tracts in painful trigeminal neuropathy subjects
   compared with controls. These data reveal that chronic neuropathic pain
   in humans is associated with discrete alterations in the anatomy of the
   primary synapse. These neuroanatomical changes may be critical for the
   generation and/or maintenance of pathological pain.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used in the study of the
   central nervous system. DTI represents a potential diagnostic tool for
   the peripheral nerve. However, more detailed information is needed for
   application of DTI in the clinical setting. In this study, peripheral
   degeneration and regeneration were evaluated using DTI-based analyses in
   a rabbit model. The changes in DTI parameters were compared to
   histological and functional changes after nerve injury. We used a high
   magnetic field (7.04 T) MRI system. Japanese white male rabbits were
   used as the model of sciatic nerve crush injury. MR images were obtained
   before injury and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks post-injury. The DTI parameters
   of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (lambda(parallel to)),
   and radial diffusivity (Xi were calculated. Our results showed decreased
   FA and increased X during the degenerative phase after sciatic nerve
   injury. In contrast, increased FA and decreased X., were observed during
   the regenerative phase. FA changes were correlated with axon number and
   with motor function recovery, assessed with the toe-spreading index.
   This study clearly demonstrates the validity of applying DTI parameters
   to the in vivo evaluation of peripheral nerve regeneration. Furthermore,
   results suggest that DTI can be a potent tool for predicting the extent
   of functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a novel
   magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) MRI assay of the proximal sciatic
   nerve (SN), which is inaccessible via current tools for assessing
   peripheral nerves, and (2) to evaluate the resulting MTR values as a
   potential biomarker of myelin content changes in patients with
   Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases.
   Methods: MTR was measured in the SN of patients with CMT type 1A (CMT1A,
   n = 10), CMT type 2A (CMT2A, n = 3), hereditary neuropathy with
   liability to pressure palsies (n = 3), and healthy controls (n = 21).
   Additional patients without a genetically confirmed subtype (n = 4), but
   whose family histories and electrophysiologic tests were consistent with
   CMT, were also included. The relationship between MTR and clinical
   neuropathy scores was assessed, and the interscan and inter-rater
   reliability of MTR was estimated.
   Results: Mean volumetric MTR values were significantly decreased in the
   SN of patients with CMT1A (33.8 +/- 3.3 percent units) and CMT2A (31.5
   +/- 1.9 percent units) relative to controls (37.2 +/- 2.3 percent
   units). A significant relationship between MTR and disability scores was
   also detected (p = 0.01 for genetically confirmed patients only, p =
   0.04 for all patients). From interscan and inter-rater reliability
   analyses, proximal nerve MTR values were repeatable at the slicewise and
   mean volumetric levels.
   Conclusions: MTR measurements may be a viable biomarker of proximal
   nerve pathology in patients with CMT.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the ability of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI)
   and T2 to help detect the mildest nerve lesion conceivable, that is,
   subclinical ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.
   Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the
   institutional ethics board. Written informed consent was obtained from
   all participants. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3.0 T
   by using proton density-and T2-weighted relaxometry and DTI on elbows in
   30 healthy subjects without clinical evidence of neuropathy.
   Quantitative analysis of ulnar nerve T2 and fractional anisotropy (FA)
   was performed, and T2 and FA values were correlated to electrical nerve
   conduction velocities (NCVs) with Pearson correlation analysis.
   Additional qualitative assessment of T2-weighted and FA images was
   performed by two readers, and sensitivity and specificity were
   calculated.
   Results: Ten of the 30 subjects (33\%) had NCV slowing across the elbow
   segment. Compared with subjects without NCV slowing, subjects with
   slowing had decreased FA values (0.51 +/- 0.09 vs 0.41 +/- 0.07,
   respectively; P = .006) and increased T2 values (64.2 msec +/- 10.9 vs
   76.2 msec +/- 13.7, respectively; P = .01) in the proximal ulnar sulcus.
   FA values showed a significant correlation (P = .01) with NCV slowing
   over the sulcus as an electrophysiologic indicator of myelin sheath
   damage. Qualitative assessment of FA maps and T2-weighted images helped
   identify subjects with conduction slowing with a sensitivity of 80\% and
   55\%, respectively, and a specificity of 83\% and 63\%.
   Conclusion: FA maps can accurately depict even mild peripheral
   neuropathy and perform better than the current standard of reference,
   T2-weighted images. DTI may therefore add diagnostic value as a highly
   sensitive technique for the detection of peripheral neuropathy. (C)

Abstract = {{Object. Extraspinal sciatica can present unique challenges in clinical
   diagnosis and management. In this study, the authors evaluated
   qualitative and quantitative patterns of sciatica-related pathology at
   the ischial tuberosity on MR neurography (MRN) studies performed for
   chronic extraspinal sciatica.
   Methods. Lumbosacral MRN studies obtained in 14 patients, at the
   University of California, San Francisco between 2007 and 2011 were
   retrospectively reviewed. The patients had been referred by
   neurosurgeons or neurologists for chronic unilateral sciatica (>= 3
   months), and the MRN reports described asymmetrical increased T2 signal
   within the sciatic nerve at the level of the ischial tuberosity. MRN
   studies were also performed prospectively in 6 healthy volunteers.
   Sciatic nerve T2 signal intensity (SI) and cross-sectional area at the
   ischial tuberosity were calculated and compared between the 2 sides in
   all 20 subjects. The same measurements were also performed at the
   sciatic notch as an internal reference. Adjacent musculoskeletal
   pathology was compared between the 2 sides in all subjects.
   Results. Seven of the 9 patients for whom detailed histories were
   available had a specific history of injury or trauma near the proximal
   hamstring preceding the onset of sciatica. Eight of the 14 patients also
   demonstrated soft-tissue abnormalities adjacent to the proximal
   hamstring origin. The remaining 6 had normal muscles, tendons, and
   marrow in the region of the ischial tuberosity. There was a significant
   difference in sciatic nerve SI and size between the symptomatic and
   asymptomatic sides at the level of the ischial tuberosity, with a mean
   adjusted SI of 1.38 compared with 1.00 (p < 0.001) and a mean
   cross-sectional nerve area of 0.66 versus 0.54 cm(2) (p = 0.002). The
   control group demonstrated symmetrical adjusted SI and sciatic nerve
   size.
   Conclusions. This study suggests that chronic sciatic neuropathy can be
   seen at the ischial tuberosity in the setting of prior proximal
   hamstring tendon injury or adjacent soft-tissue abnormalities. Because
   hamstring tendon injury as a cause of chronic sciatica remains a
   diagnosis of exclusion, this distinct category of patients has not been
   described in the radiographic literature and merits special attention
   from clinicians and radiologists in the management of extraspinal
   sciatica. Magnetic resonance neurography is useful for evaluating
   chronic sciatic neuropathy both qualitatively and quantitatively,
   particularly in patients for whom electromyography and traditional MRI
   studies are unrevealing.}},

Abstract = {{To analyse pelvic autonomous innervation with magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) in comparison with anatomical macroscopic dissection on cadavers.
   Pelvic MRI was performed in eight adult human cadavers (five men and
   three women) using a total of four sequences each: T1, T1 fat
   saturation, T2, diffusion weighed. Images were analysed with
   segmentation software in order to extract nervous tissue. Key height
   points of the pelvis autonomous innervation were located in every
   specimen. Standardised pelvis dissections were then performed. Distances
   between the same key points and the three anatomical references forming
   a coordinate system were measured on MRIs and dissections. Concordance
   (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient) between MRI and dissection
   was calculated.
   MRI acquisition allowed an adequate visualization of the autonomous
   innervation. Comparison between 3D MRI images and dissection showed
   concordant pictures. The statistical analysis showed a mean difference
   of less than 1 cm between MRI and dissection measures and a correct
   concordance correlation coefficient on at least two coordinates for each
   point.
   Our acquisition and post-processing method demonstrated that MRI is
   suitable for detection of autonomous pelvic innervations and can offer a
   preoperative nerve cartography.

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to establish dynamic
   contrast-enhanced perfusion in peripheral nerves for determination of
   blood-nerve permeability (K-trans) and nerve blood volume (NBV) in
   peripheral neuropathies as compared with healthy controls.
   Methods: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee,
   and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
   Forty-three controls (24 women, 19 men; age, 48.7 +/- 17.5 years) and 59
   patients with peripheral neuropathy (28 women, 31 men; age, 52.7 +/-
   12.4 years) were examined by a standard protocol including a T1-weighted
   dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence (time of repetition/time of echo,
   4.91/1.64; 10 slices; resolution 0.8 x 0.6 x 3.0 mm(3)). Time - signal
   intensity analysis was performed by normalizing to pre-bolus arrival and
   calculating the mean contrast uptake (MCU) for each patient. Further
   analyses were performed by customized software to calculate K-trans and
   NBV. Statistical analysis included 2-sided Student's t tests of controls
   versus patients, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and
   subgroup analysis of patients according to etiologies of neuropathy.
   Results: Time-signal intensity analysis showed significantly increased
   contrast uptake in patients as compared with controls (MCU, 1.29 +/-
   0.15 vs 1.18 +/- 0.08; P < 0.001). This was caused mainly by an increase
   in K-trans (0.046 +/- 0.025 vs 0.026 +/- 0.016 min(-1); P < 0.001) and
   less by an increase in NBV (3.9 +/- 2.6 vs 3.0 +/- 1.9 mL/100 mL; P =
   0.12). This trend was true for all etiologies except entrapment
   neuropathies. Excluding these, receiver operating characteristic
   analysis found an area under the curve of 0.78 (95\% confidence
   interval, 0.69-0.89) for MCU and 0.77 (95\% confidence interval,
   0.65-0.90) for K-trans to discriminate neuropathy from control.
   Conclusions: Dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion is a feasible technique
   to assess K-trans and NBV in peripheral nerves and may be used in future
   investigations on peripheral neuropathies.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence indicates that alterations within the peripheral
   nervous system (PNS) are involved at an early stage in the amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenetic cascade. In this study, magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), neurophysiologic analyses, and histologic
   analyses were used to monitor the extent of PNS damage in the
   hSOD-1(G93A) ALS rat model. The imaging signature of the disease was
   defined using in vivo MRI of the sciatic nerve. Initial abnormalities
   were detected in the nerves by an increase in T2 relaxation time before
   the onset of clinical disease; diffusion MRI showed a progressive
   increase in mean and radial diffusivity and reduction of fractional
   anisotropy at advanced stages of disease. Histologic analysis
   demonstrated early impairment of the blood-nerve barrier followed by
   acute axonal degeneration associated with endoneurial edema and
   macrophage response in motor nerve compartments. Progressive axonal
   degeneration and motor nerve fiber loss correlated with MRI and
   neurophysiologic changes. These functional and morphologic
   investigations of the PNS might be applied in following disease
   progression in preclinical therapeutic studies. This study establishes
   the PNS signature in this rat ALS model (shedding new light into
   pathogenesis) and provides a rationale for translating into future
   systematic MRI studies of PNS involvement in patients with ALS.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo implement high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for
   visualization and quantification of peripheral nerves in human forearm.
   Materials and MethodsThis HIPAA-compliant study was approved by our
   Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained
   from all the study participants. Images were acquired with T-1-and
   T-2-weighted turbo spin echo with/without fat saturation, short tau
   inversion recovery (STIR). In addition, high spatial resolution
   (1.0x1.0x3.0 mm(3)) DTI sequence was optimized for clearly visualizing
   ulnar, superficial radial and median nerves in the forearm. Maps of the
   DTI derived indices, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD),
   longitudinal diffusivity ((//)) and radial diffusivity () were
   generated.
   ResultsFor the first time, the three peripheral nerves, ulnar,
   superficial radial, and median, were visualized unequivocally on high
   resolution DTI-derived maps. DTI delineated the forearm nerves more
   clearly than other sequences. Significant differences in the DTI-derived
   measures, FA, MD, (//) and (perpendicular to), were observed among the
   three nerves. A strong correlation between the nerve size derived from
   FA map and T-2-weighted images was observed.
   ConclusionHigh spatial resolution DTI is superior in identifying and
   quantifying the median, ulnar, and superficial radial nerves in human
   forearm. Consistent visualization of small nerves and nerve branches is

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) has hitherto been considered a
   disease of the peripheral nervous system only, with central nervous
   system (CNS) involvement largely overlooked. The aim of this study was
   to investigate any differences in brain structure in subjects with DPN.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   Thirty-six subjects with type 1 diabetes (No DPN {[}n = 18], Painful DPN
   {[}n = 9], Painless DPN {[}n = 9]) underwent neurophysiological
   assessment to quantify the severity of DPN. All subjects, including 18
   healthy volunteers (HVs), underwent volumetric brain magnetic resonance
   imaging at 3 Tesla.
   RESULTS
   Adjusted peripheral gray matter volume was statistically significantly
   lower in subjects with painless and painful DPN (mean 599.6 ml {[}SEM
   9.8 ml] and 585.4 ml {[}10.0 ml], respectively) compared with those with
   No DPN (626.5 ml {[}5.7 ml]) and HVs (639.9 ml {[}7.2 ml]; ANCOVA, P =
   0.001). The difference in adjusted peripheral gray matter volume between
   subjects with No DPN and HVs and those with Painful DPN and Painless DPN
   was not statistically significant (P = 0.16 and 0.30, respectively).
   Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed greater localized volume loss
   in the primary somatosensory cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and cingulate
   cortex (corrected P < 0.05) in DPN subjects.
   CONCLUSIONS
   This is the first study to focus on structural changes in the brain
   associated with DPN. Our findings suggest increased peripheral gray
   matter volume loss, localized to regions involved with somatosensory
   perception in subjects with DPN. This may have important implications
   for the long-term prognosis of DPN.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic potential
   of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for pathologies of the peripheral
   nervous system (PNS) through clinical, electrophysiological and
   morphological evaluation of the median nerve.
   Methods: The present work was a multilevel prospective study involving
   30 subjects, 15 of whom had carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and 15 healthy
   controls. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation through
   administration of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ),
   electroneurography (ENG), 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging with DTI,
   and calculation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion
   coefficient (ADC) at the flexor retinacu, lum. Tractography was also
   performed for three-dimensional reconstruction of the route of the
   median nerve through the carpal tunnel. The degree of functional
   impairment was compared with the anatomical damage to the median nerve
   according to ENG and DTI.
   Results: FA and ADC were significantly correlated with ENG parameters of
   CTS and BCTQ data. Mean FA and ADC values in the CTS patients were 0.359
   +/- 0.06 and 1.866 +/- 0.050 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively, vs 0.59 +/-
   0.014 and 1.395 +/- 0.035 x 10(-3) mm2/s, respectively, in the controls.
   FA was decreased and ADC increased in patients with CTS compared with
   healthy controls (P< 0.05).
   Conclusion: DTI parameters were clearly confirmed by both clinical and
   ENG data and, therefore, may be used for the diagnosis of CTS. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Purpose Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the
   leading cause of death for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
   Identification of hypermetabolic lesions on PET may help identify
   patients at risk for MPNST. The objective of this study was to identify
   clinical and MRI-derived variables that predicted increased metabolic
   activity of neurofibromas in NF1 patients as determined by PET.
   Methods This prospective study included NF1 patients with neurofibromas
   of 5 cm in diameter or greater. All patients underwent whole-body MRI
   and F-18-FDG PET imaging. Tumor volume was calculated from the MR scans
   using a semiautomated 3-dimensional segmentation method. SUVmax's were
   calculated to quantify metabolic activity. Logistic regression analyses
   were performed to determine the relationship among SUVmax, tumor volume,
   location (extremity vs trunk), type (plexiform vs circumscribed), depth
   (superficial vs deep), patient age, and whole-body tumor burden.
   Results A total of 311 neurofibromas were identified in 19 NF1 patients
   (mean age, 38 years; range, 19-58 years). One extreme outlier was
   excluded from analysis. Whole-body tumor volumes ranged from 0.4 to
   1182.4 mL. Fifty of 310 tumors were FDG-avid on PET (16\%) with median
   SUVmax of 2.2 (range, 0.4-9.6). Metabolic activity (SUVmax >2.5)
   correlated with tumor location (deep > superficial, trunk > extremity)
   in tumors with PET avidity.
   Conclusions In NF1 patients with neurofibromas of 5 cm or greater, the
   majority of internal tumors are not metabolically active on PET. Tumors
   with increased metabolic activity as defined by SUVmax greater than 2.5
   (ie, suggestive of MPNST) are more likely to be deep and located within
   the trunk.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging is an emerging magnetic resonance (MR)
   imaging technique for evaluating the microstructure of well-organized
   biologic tissues such as muscles and nerves. DT imaging provides
   information about tissue microstructure by producing three-dimensional
   maps of water molecule movements. The two main parameters of measurement
   at DT imaging, fractional anisotropy and the apparent diffusion
   coefficient, allow quantitation of architectural changes occurring in
   tissue. These parameters are modified in the presence of cervical
   spondylotic myelopathy, cervical spine trauma, carpal tunnel syndrome,
   lumbar nerve compression, peripheral nerve tumors, and muscle ischemia.
   Their alteration may be observed at DT imaging even when no abnormality
   is seen at conventional MR imaging, a fact that suggests that DT imaging
   allows the detection of abnormalities at an earlier stage of injury.
   Experimental studies in animals have shown that DT imaging consistently
   allows identification of pathophysiologic alterations in tissue that
   correlate with histologic findings. Tractographic images accurately
   depict both normal and abnormal diffusion in anatomic structures such as
   the thigh and pelvic muscles, cervical spine, and lumbar nerves.
   Patients with chronic diseases also may benefit from follow-up
   evaluation with DT imaging, although DT imaging sequences must be
   further adapted to improve the evaluation of specific anatomic regions
   by reducing artifacts, optimizing spatial resolution, and minimizing
   acquisition time. Given its proven potential for use in identifying
   abnormalities that are otherwise identifiable only with
   electrophysiologic and histopathologic studies, and with future
   technical improvements, DT imaging could soon become a standard method
   for early diagnosis, management, and follow-up of disease in the spine,
   muscles, and peripheral nerves. (C)RSNA, 2014}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in the field of peripheral nerve imaging extend the
   capabilities of imaging modalities to assist in the diagnosis and
   treatment of patients with peripheral nerve maladies. Methods such as
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its derivative diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI), ultrasound (US) and positron emission tomography (PET)
   are capable of assessing nerve structure and function following injury
   and relating the state of the nerve to electrophysiological and
   histological analysis. Of the imaging methods surveyed here, each
   offered unique and interesting advantages related to the field. MRI
   offered the opportunity to visualize immune activity on the injured
   nerve throughout the course of the regeneration process, and DTI offered
   numerical characterization of the injury and the ability to develop
   statistical bases for diagnosing injury. US extends imaging to the
   treatment phase by enabling more precise analgesic applications
   following surgery, and PET represents a novel method of assessing nerve
   injury through analysis of relative metabolism rates in injured and
   healthy tissue. Exciting new possibilities to enhance and extend the
   abilities of imaging methods are also discussed, including innovative

   nerve FA values correlated with clinical disability scores and
   electrophysiological parameters of axonal damage at baseline and 6

Title = {{Diffusion tensor imaging of the median nerve at 3.0 T using different MR

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the agreement of fractional anisotropy (FA) and
   apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median nerve on 3.0 T
   MR scanners from different vendors.
   Materials and methods: IRB approved study including 16 healthy
   volunteers (9 women; mean age 30.6 +/- 5.3 years). Diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) of the dominant wrist was performed on three 3.0 T MR
   scanners (GE, Siemens, Philips) using similar imaging protocols and
   vendor-proprietary hard-and software. Intra-, inter-reader and
   inter-vendor agreements were assessed.
   Results: ICCs for intra-/inter-reader agreements ranged from
   0.843-0.970/0.846-0.956 for FA, and 0.840-0.940/0.726-0.929 for ADC,
   respectively. ANOVA analysis identified significant differences for
   FA/ADC measurements among vendors (p < 0.001/p < 0.01, respectively).
   Overall mean values for FA were 0.63 (SD +/- 0.1) and 0.999 x 10(-3)
   mm(2)/s (SD +/- 0.134 x 10(-3)) for ADC. A significant negative
   measurement bias was found for FA values from the GE scanner (-0.05 and
   -0.07) and for ADC values from the Siemens scanner (-0.053 and -0.063 x
   10(-3) mm(2)/s) as compared to the remainder vendors
   Conclusion: FA and ADC values of the median nerve obtained on different
   3.0 T MR scanners differ significantly, but are in comparison to the
   standard deviation of absolute values small enough to not have an impact
   on larger group studies or when substantial diffusion changes can be
   expected. However, caution is warranted in an individual patient when
   interpreting diffusion values from different scanner acquisitions (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose: The speed limit for three-dimensional Fourier-encoded steady
   state free precession (SSFP) imaging is explored on a clinical whole
   body system and pushed toward a pulse repetition time (TR) close to or
   even below the 1ms regime; in the following referred to as ultra-fast
   SSFP imaging.
   Methods: To this end, contemporary optimization strategies, such as
   efficient gradient switching patterns, partial echoes, ramp sampling
   techniques, and a target-related design of excitation pulses were
   applied to explore the lower boundaries in TR for SSFP-based Cartesian
   imaging.
   Results: Generally, minimal TR was limited in vivo by peripheral nerve
   stimulation, allowing a TR approximate to 1ms for isotropic resolutions
   down to about 2 mm. As a result, ultra-fast balanced SSFP provides
   artifact-free images even for targets with severe susceptibility
   variations, and native high-resolution structural and functional in vivo
   H-1 imaging of the human lung is demonstrated at 1.5 T.
   Conclusion: On clinical whole body MRI systems, the TR of SSFP-based
   Cartesian imaging can be pushed toward the 1ms regime. As a result,
   ultra-fast SSFP protocols might represent a promising new powerful
   approach for SSFP-based imaging, not only for lung but also in a variety
   of clinical and scientific applications. Magn Reson Med 70:657-663,

Abstract = {{Objective
   To assess the outcomes and safety after CT-guided percutaneous
   sacroplasty in patients with painful sacral insufficiency fractures or
   pathologic sacral lesions.
   Methods
   A retrospective multicenter analysis of consecutive patients undergoing
   CT-guided sacroplasty for painful sacral insufficiency fractures or
   sacral lesions was undertaken. The inclusion criteria consisted of
   severe sacral pain not responding to conservative medical management
   with imaging evidence of unilateral or bilateral sacral insufficiency
   fractures or lesions. Outcome measures included hospitalization status
   (inpatient or outpatient), pre-treatment and post-treatment visual
   analog scale (VAS) scores, analgesic use and complications. Patients
   were followed at approximately 1month and for at least 1year after their
   sacroplasty procedure.
   Results
   Two hundred and forty-three patients were included in the study, 204
   with painful sacral insufficiency fractures and 39 with symptomatic
   sacral lesions. The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.2 +/- 1.1 was
   significantly improved after sacroplasty to 1.9 +/- 1.7 in patients with
   sacral insufficiency fractures (p<0.001). The average pre-treatment VAS
   score of 9.0 +/- 0.9 in patients with sacral lesions was significantly
   improved after sacroplasty to 2.6 +/- 2.4 (p<0.001). There were no major
   complications or procedure-related deaths. One patient who was treated
   for a sacral insufficiency fracture experienced radicular pain due to
   local extravasation of cement that subsequently required surgical
   decompression for symptomatic relief.
   Conclusions
   CT-guided percutaneous sacroplasty is a safe and effective procedure in
   the treatment of painful sacral insufficiency fractures or lesions. It
   is associated with prompt and durable pain relief and should be
   considered as an effective treatment option in this patient population.}},

Abstract = {{Trigeminal neuralgia, painful trigeminal neuropathy, and painful
   temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are chronic orofacial pain conditions
   that are thought to have fundamentally different etiologies. Trigeminal
   neuralgia and neuropathy are thought to arise from damage to or pressure
   on the trigeminal nerve, whereas TMD results primarily from peripheral
   nociceptor activation. This study sought to assess the volume and
   microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in these 3 conditions. In 9
   neuralgia, 18 neuropathy, 20 TMD, and 26 healthy controls, the
   trigeminal root entry zone was selected on high-resolution T1-weighted
   magnetic resonance images and the volume (mm(3)) calculated.
   Additionally, using diffusion-tensor images (DTIs), the mean diffusivity
   and fractional anisotropy values of the trigeminal nerve root were
   calculated. Trigeminal neuralgia patients displayed a significant (47\%)
   decrease in nerve volume but no change in DTI values. Conversely,
   trigeminal neuropathy subjects displayed a significant (40\%) increase
   in nerve volume but again no change in DTI values. In contrast, TMD
   subjects displayed no change in volume or DTI values. The data suggest
   that the changes occurring within the trigeminal nerve are not uniform
   in all orofacial pain conditions. These structural and volume changes
   may have implications in diagnosis and management of different forms of
   chronic orofacial pain.
   Perspective: This study reveals that neuropathic orofacial pain
   conditions are associated with changes in trigeminal nerve volume,
   whereas non-neuropathic orofacial pain is not associated with any change
   in nerve volume. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc. on

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis: Longstanding diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with
   the risk of complications affecting the central nervous system. The aims
   were to study brain volume and cortical thickness in regional brain
   areas in DM patients and to correlate the findings with relevant
   clinical data.
   Methods: 15 patients with longstanding (average 24.6 years) type 1 DM
   and 20 healthy controls were studied in a 3T magnetic resonance scanner.
   Using an automated surface based cortical segmentation method, cortical
   thickness was assessed in anatomical regions including total and
   lobe-wise grey and white matter volumes. Also morphological changes were
   evaluated.
   Results: No differences between patients and controls were found in
   regard to number of white matter lesions (P = 0.50), grey and white
   matter volumes (P = 0.25) and overall cortical thickness (P = 0.64).
   Subanalysis revealed exclusively reduced cortical thickness of the
   postcentral (P = 0.03) and superior parietal gyrus (P = 0.008) in
   patients. The cortical thickness of these regions was not associated
   with diabetes duration, age at diabetes onset or to HbA1c (all P >
   0.08). Patients with peripheral neuropathy showed reduced right
   postcentral gyrus cortical thickness compared to patients without
   peripheral neuropathy (P = 0.02).
   Conclusions: Patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed cortical
   thinning involving sensory related areas, even though no overall
   macrostructural brain alterations were detected. This could possibly
   have underlying functional significance since cortical thinning was
   associated to presence of peripheral neuropathy. The absence of
   universal macrostructural changes might illustrate that more pronounced
   brain pathology is likely to be preceded by more subtle microstructural
   changes as reported in other studies.}},

Abstract = {{MR-based brain imaging technologies provide a suite of functional and
   structural metrics that can be used to test hypotheses about the CNS
   mechanisms underlying pain perception and chronification, from a
   cellular level to a systems level. Two types of functional MRI discussed
   in this review provide insight into pain mechanisms: stimulus-evoked
   fMRI and task-free ({''}resting state{''}) fMRI. The former can assess
   how the brain responds to noxious or non-noxious stimuli normally or in
   a chronic pain state as a window into understanding pain, hyperalgesia
   and allodynia. The latter can assess functional connectivity reflecting
   synchronous ultra-slow frequency oscillation between brain areas. This
   provides insight into how brain areas work together as networks to
   produce pain and how these networks may be modified due to chronic pain.
   Perfusion MR (e. g., arterial spin labeling) can also provide task-free
   information pertaining to ongoing brain activity that may reflect
   spontaneous (ongoing) chronic pain. Structural MR techniques can be used
   to delineate gray and white matter abnormalities and markers of
   neuroinflammation associated with chronic pains. Functional and
   structural MRI findings point to brain and peripheral nerve
   abnormalities in patients with chronic pain, some of which are
   pre-existing and others that develop with prolonged pain (and related
   neuroinflammation) over time. Recent studies indicate that some
   structural brain abnormalities associated with chronic pain are
   reversible following effective pain treatment. These data together with
   findings from studies of individual differences suggest that some
   chronic pains arise from a combination of pre-existing vulnerabilities
   and sustained abnormal input.}},

Abstract = {{Lower back pain is a common problem frequently encountered without
   specific biomarkers that correlate well with an individual patient's
   pain generators. MRI quantification of diffusion and T2 relaxation
   properties may provide novel insight into the mechanical and
   inflammatory changes that occur in the lumbosacral nerve roots in
   patients with lower back pain. Accurate imaging of the spinal nerve
   roots is difficult because of their small caliber and oblique course in
   all three planes. Two-dimensional in-plane imaging of the lumbosacral
   nerve roots requires oblique coronal imaging with large field of view
   (FOV) in both dimensions, resulting in severe geometric distortions
   using single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) techniques. The present work
   describes initial success using a reduced-FOV single-shot spin-echo EPI
   acquisition to obtain in-plane diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2
   mapping of the bilateral lumbar nerve roots at the L4 level of healthy
   subjects, minimizing partial volume effects, breathing artifacts and
   geometric distortions. A significant variation in DTI and T2 mapping
   metrics is also reported along the course of the normal nerve root. The
   fractional anisotropy is statistically significantly lower in the dorsal
   root ganglia (0.287 +/- 0.068) than in more distal regions in the spinal
   nerve (0.402 +/- 0.040) (p<105). The T2 relaxation value is
   statistically significantly higher in the dorsal root ganglia (78.0 +/-
   11.9ms) than in more distal regions in the spinal nerve (59.5 +/- 7.4ms)
   (p<105). The quantification of nerve root DTI and T2 properties using
   the proposed methodology may identify the specific site of any
   degenerative and inflammatory changes along the nerve roots of patients
   with lower back pain. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate magnetization transfer (MT) effects as a new
   source of contrast for imaging and tracking of peripheral foot nerves.
   Materials and Methods: Two sets of 3D spoiled gradient-echo images
   acquired with and without a saturation pulse were used to generate MT
   ratio (MTR) maps of 260 m in-plane resolution for eight volunteers at
   3T. Scan parameters were adjusted to minimize signal loss due to T2
   dephasing, and a dedicated coil was used to improve the inherently low
   signal-to-noise ratio of small voxels. Resulting MTR values in foot
   nerves were compared with those in surrounding muscle tissue. Results:
   Average MTR values for muscle (45.5 +/- 1.4\%) and nerve (21.4 +/-
   3.1\%) were significantly different (P < 0.0001). In general, the
   difference in MTR values was sufficiently large to allow for
   intensity-based segmentation and tracking of foot nerves in individual
   subjects. This procedure was termed MT-based 3D visualization.
   Conclusion: The MTR serves as a new source of contrast for imaging of
   peripheral foot nerves and provides a means for high spatial resolution
   tracking of these structures. The proposed methodology is directly
   applicable on standard clinical MR scanners and could be applied to
   systemic pathologies, such as diabetes. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

Abstract = {{To assess the value of reduced field of view (rFOV) imaging in diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of the lumbar nerve roots at 3 T
   from the perspective of future clinical trials.
   DTI images of the lumbar nerves were obtained in eight healthy
   volunteers, with and without the rFOV technique. Non-coplanar excitation
   and refocusing pulses associated with outer volume suppression (OVS)
   were used to achieve rFOV imaging. Tractography was performed. A visual
   evaluation of image quality was made by two observers, both senior
   musculoskeletal radiologists. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent
   diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured in L5 and S1 roots.
   rFOV images of the L5 and S1 roots were assessed as being superior to
   full FOV (fFOV) images. Image quality was rated as good to excellent by
   both observers. Interobserver agreement was good. No significant
   difference was found in FA and ADC measurements of the L5 or S1 roots.
   On the contrary, only poor-quality images could be obtained with fFOV
   imaging as major artefacts were present.
   The rFOV approach was essential to achieve high-quality DTI imaging of
   lumbar nerve roots on 3-T MRI.
   Key Points
   Diffusion tensor 3-T MR imaging of lumbar nerve roots creates severe
   artefacts.
   A reduced field of view drastically reduces artefacts, thereby improving
   image quality.
   Good-quality tractography images can even be obtained with rFOV imaging.
   rFOV DTI is better than fFOV DTI for clinical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations in either nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA can result in
   disruption of oxidative phosphorylation and lead to mitochondrial
   dysfunction. Mitochondrial disease manifestations occur predominantly in
   the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and/or involve
   several organ systems. The consequences range from manifestations of a
   single organ or tissues, such as muscle fatigue, if confined only to
   muscle, seizures, intellectual disabilities, dementia, and stroke (if to
   the central nervous system), leading to disability or even early death.
   The definitive diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder can be difficult to
   establish. Criteria and checklists have been established and are more
   reflective of adult disease. However, in children, when symptoms suggest
   a mitochondrial disease, neuroimaging features may have more diagnostic
   impact and additionally these can be used to follow the course,
   evolution, and recovery of the disease. This review will demonstrate the
   common neuroimaging patterns in patients with mitochondrial disorders
   and point out how various newer neuroimaging modalities may be exploited
   to glean information as to the different aspects of mitochondrial
   dysfunction or resulting neurological and cognitive disruption, although
   reports in the literature using these methods remain sparse.}},

   41 +/- 18 years; range, 11-83 years) with a nerve tumor or tumorlike
   condition (25 benign, 5 malignant) underwent 3T MR imaging by using
   anatomic (n = 29), functional diffusion, DWI (n = 21), and DTI (n = 24)
   techniques. Images were evaluated for image quality (3-point scale), ADC
   of the lesion, tractography, and fractional anisotropy of nerves with
   interobserver reliability in ADC and FA measurements.
   RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in age (benign, 40 +/-
   18 versus malignant, 45 +/- 19 years) and sex (benign, male/female =
   12:12 versus malignant, male/female = 3: 2) (P >.05). All anatomic
   (29/29, 100\%) MR imaging studies received ``good{''} quality; 20/21
   (95\%) DWI and 21/24 (79\%) DTI studies received ``good{''} quality. ADC
   of benign lesions (1.848 +/- 0.40 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) differed from that
   of malignant lesions (0.900 +/- 0.25 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, P <.001) with
   excellent interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.988 {[} 95\% CI,
   0.976-0.994]). There were no FA or ADC differences between men and women
   (P >.05). FA of involved nerves was lower than that in contralateral
   healthy nerves (P <.001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC =
   0.970 {[} 95\% CI, 0.946-0.991]). ADC on DTI and DWI was not
   statistically different (P >.05), with excellent intermethod reliability
   (ICC = 0.943 {[}95\% CI, 0.836-0.980]). Tractography differences were
   observed in benign and malignant lesions.
   CONCLUSIONS: 3T MR imaging and DTI are valuable methods for anatomic and
   functional evaluation of peripheral nerve lesions with excellent
   interobserver reliability. While tractography and low FA provide insight
   into neural integrity, low diffusivity values indicate malignancy in
   neural masses.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: The autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of
   Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is an early-onset neurodegenerative
   disorder caused by mutations in the SACS gene. The disease, first
   described in Canadian families from Quebec, is characterized by
   cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract involvement and peripheral
   neuropathy.
   Methods: Analysis of SACS gene allowed the identification of 14 patients
   with ARSACS from 13 unrelated Italian families. Clinical phenotype, gene
   mutations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were analysed.
   Results: We found 16 novel SACS gene mutations, including a large
   in-frame deletion. The age at onset was in infancy, but one patient
   presented the first symptoms at age 32. Progression of the disease was
   variable, and increased muscle tone was mostly recognized in later
   stages. Structural MRI showed atrophy of the superior cerebellar vermis,
   a bulky pons exhibiting T2-hypointense stripes, identified as the
   corticospinal tract (CST), thinning of the corpus callosum and a rim of
   T2-hyperintensity around the thalami in 100\% of cases. The presence of
   iron or other paramagnetic substances was excluded. Diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) revealed grossly over-represented transverse pontine
   fibres (TPF), which prevented reconstruction of the CST at this level
   (100\% of cases). In all patients, significant microstructural
   alterations were found in the supratentorial white matter of forceps,
   cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus.
   Conclusions: Our findings further enlarge the genetic spectrum of SACS
   mutations and widen the study of clinical phenotype. MRI characteristics
   indicate that pontine changes and supratentorial abnormalities are
   diagnostic. The over-representation of TPF on DTI suggests a
   developmental component in the pathogenesis of the disease.}},

Title = {{Altered brain morphometry in carpal tunnel syndrome is associated with
   median nerve pathology}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{313-319}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common median nerve
   entrapment neuropathy characterized by pain, paresthesias, diminished
   peripheral nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and maladaptive functional
   brain neuroplasticity. We evaluated structural reorganization in brain
   gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) and whether such plasticity is
   linked to altered median nerve function in CTS.
   Methods: We performed NCV testing, T1-weighted structural MRI, and
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 28 CTS and 28 age-matched healthy
   controls (HC). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) contrasted regional GM
   volume for CTS versus HC. Significant clusters were correlated with
   clinical metrics and served as seeds to define associated WM tracts
   using DTI data and probabilistic tractography. Within these WM tracts,
   fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity were
   evaluated for group differences and correlations with clinical metrics.
   Results: For CTS subjects, GM volume was significantly reduced in
   contralesional S1 (hand-area), pulvinar and frontal pole. GM volume in
   contralesional S1 correlated with median NCV. NCV was also correlated
   with RD and was negatively correlated with FA within U-fiber
   cortico-cortical association tracts identified from the contralesional
   S1 VBM seed.
   Conclusions: Our study identified clear morphometric changes in the CTS
   brain. This central morphometric change is likely secondary to
   peripheral nerve pathology and altered somatosensory afference. Enhanced
   axonal coherence and myelination within cortico-cortical tracts
   connecting primary somatosensory and motor areas may accompany
   peripheral nerve deafferentation. As structural plasticity was
   correlated with NCV and not symptomatology, the former may be a better
   determinant of appropriate clinical intervention for CTS, including
   surgery. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Non-coding RNA ANRIL and the number of plexiform neurofibromas in
   patients with NF1 microdeletions}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENETICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is caused by mutations of the
   NF1 gene at 17q11.2. In 95\% of non-founder NF1 patients, NF1 mutations
   are identifiable by means of a comprehensive mutation analysis. 5-10\%
   of these patients harbour microdeletions encompassing the NF1 gene and
   its flanking regions. NF1 is characterised by tumours of the peripheral
   nerve sheaths, the pathognomonic neurofibromas. Considerable inter-and
   intra-familial variation in expressivity of the disease has been
   observed which is influenced by genetic modifiers unrelated to the
   constitutional NF1 mutation. The number of plexiform neurofibromas (PNF)
   in NF1 patients is a highly heritable genetic trait. Recently, SNP
   rs2151280 located within the non-coding RNA gene ANRIL at 9p21.3, was
   identified as being strongly associated with PNF number in a
   family-based association study. The T-allele of rs2151280, which
   correlates with reduced ANRIL expression, appears to be associated with
   higher PNF number. ANRIL directly binds to the SUZ12 protein, an
   essential component of polycomb repressive complex 2, and is required
   for SUZ12 occupancy of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B tumour suppressor genes as well
   as for their epigenetic silencing.
   Methods: Here, we explored a potential association of PNF number and PNF
   volume with SNP rs2151280 in 29 patients with constitutional NF1
   microdeletions using the exact Cochran-Armitage test for trends and the
   exact Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Both the PNF number and total tumour
   volume in these 29 NF1 patients were assessed by whole-body MRI. The NF1
   microdeletions observed in these 29 patients encompassed the NF1 gene as
   well as its flanking regions, including the SUZ12 gene.
   Results: In the 29 microdeletion patients investigated, neither the PNF
   number nor PNF volume was found to be associated with the T-allele of
   rs2151280.
   Conclusion: Our findings imply that, at least in patients with NF1
   microdeletions, PNF susceptibility is not associated with rs2151280.
   Although somatic inactivation of the NF1 wild-type allele is considered
   to be the PNF-initiating event in NF1 patients with intragenic mutations
   and patients with NF1 microdeletions, both patient groups may differ
   with regard to tumour progression because of the heterozygous
   constitutional deletion of SUZ12 present only in patients with NF1
   microdeletions.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To implement a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol for
   visualization of peripheral nerves in human forearm. Materials and
   Methods: This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
   (HIPAA)-compliant study was approved by our Institutional Review Board
   and written informed consent was obtained from 10 healthy participants.
   T1- and T2-weighted turbo spin echo with fat saturation, short tau
   inversion recovery (STIR), and DTI sequences with 21 diffusion-encoding
   directions were implemented to acquire images of the forearm nerves with
   an 8 channel knee coil on a 3T MRI scanner. Identification of the nerves
   was based on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, STIR, and DTI-derived fractional
   anisotropy (FA) images. Maps of the DTI-derived indices, FA, mean
   diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity (?//), and radial diffusivity
   (??) along the length of the nerves were generated. Results: DTI-derived
   maps delineated the forearm nerves more clearly than images acquired
   with other sequences. Only ulnar and median nerves were clearly
   visualized on the DTI-derived FA maps. No significant differences were
   observed between the left and right forearms in any of the DTI-derived
   measures. Significant variation in the DTI measures was observed along
   the length of the nerve. Significant differences in the DTI measures
   were also observed between the median and ulnar nerves. Conclusion: DTI
   is superior in visualizing the median and ulnar nerves in the human
   forearm. The normative data could potentially help distinguish normal
   from diseased nerves. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012;36:920927. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The ability to investigate microstructural properties of the central
   nervous system with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown in
   many studies. More recently, DTI is being applied outside the brain
   showing promising results, for instance, for investigating muscle
   tissue. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography to study the nerves of the sacral
   plexus in humans in vivo and to assess the architectural configuration
   and microstructural properties of these peripheral nerves. For this
   research goal we optimized the acquisition parameters of a DTI sequence
   and acquired data from 10 healthy adults and one 12-year patient having
   spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. For the healthy
   volunteers, we estimated the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean (MD),
   axial (AD), and radial diffusivities (RD) of the sacral plexus nerves
   which may serve as a baseline for future studies. We demonstrated that
   tractography of the sacral plexus on a 3 Testa MR scanner is feasible,
   giving 3D insight in the general anatomy and organization of the nerves
   L4 to S3. In addition, branches to the pudendal nerve were also found in
   4 volunteers. There were no significant differences in any of the
   estimated diffusion measures between the right and left sided nerves or
   between the nerves L4 to S3 on an intra-subject basis. Furthermore,
   clinical feasibility of DTI and tractography in a child having spina
   bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction is demonstrated. The
   architectural configuration of the child's sacral plexus was comparable
   with the healthy volunteers and no significant disrupted nerve fibers
   were observed. However, there are strong indications that abnormal
   diffusion characteristics are present at the level of the neural tube
   defect due to incomplete segments of the nerves that are close to the
   vertebrae. These findings are encouraging for using DTI as a means to
   investigate changes in microstructural properties of the nerves of the
   sacral plexus. Moreover, this new methodology may provide a new avenue
   to a better analysis and diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunctions.

Abstract = {{We investigated the correlation between age and the fractional

   compared the age-corrected FA values of peripheral nerves in healthy
   subjects and patients with polyneuropathy.
   The institutional review board approved this study and informed consent
   was obtained from all participants before entry into the study. We
   optimized diffusion tensor imaging using a 3-T magnetic resonance
   scanner and an extremity coil for scanning tibial nerves. The effect of
   age and sex on the FA values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers was
   investigated and the age-corrected FA values of tibial nerves in healthy
   volunteers and patients with polyneuropathy were compared.
   The maximum FA values of the tibial nerves remained constant until age
   45 (approximately 0.516); they subsequently decreased by 0.004/year in
   healthy volunteers. After removing the effect of age with an
   age-adjusted equation, the median maximum FA values in the volunteers
   and patients were 0.518 (range, 0.406-0.616) and 0.442 (range,
   0.376-0.530), respectively. The age-corrected FA values were
   significantly lower in the patients than the healthy volunteers (p <
   0.001). There was no significant gender-related difference in the
   maximum FA values of the tibial nerves (p = 0.416).
   The age-corrected FA value of the peripheral nerves helps to
   differentiate between age-related peripheral nerve degeneration and
   polyneuropathies.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The purpose of this study was to systematically assess the
   optimal b-value and reconstruction parameters for DTI and fiber
   tractography of the median nerve at 3.0T.
   Methods: Local ethical board approved study with 45 healthy volunteers
   (15 men, 30 women; mean age, 41 +/- 3.4 years) who underwent DTI of the
   right wrist at 3.0T. A single-shot echo-planar-imaging sequence (TR/TE
   10123/40 ms) was acquired at four different b-values (800, 1000, 1200,
   and 1400 s/mm(2)). Two independent readers performed post processing and
   fiber-tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated.
   Fiber tracts of the median nerve were generated using four different
   algorithms containing different FA thresholds and different angulation
   tolerances. Data were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively.
   Results: Tracking algorithms using a minimum FA threshold of 0.2 and a
   maximum angulation of 10 degrees were significantly better than other
   algorithms. Fiber tractography generated significantly longer fibers in
   DTI acquisitions with higher b-values (1200 and 1400 s/mm(2) versus 800
   s/mm(2); p < 0.001). The overall quality of fiber tractography was best
   at a b-value of 1200 s/mm(2) (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: In conclusion, our results indicate use of b-values between
   1000 and 1400 s/mm(2) for DTI of the median nerve at 3.0T. Optimal
   reconstruction parameters for fiber tractography should encompass a
   minimum FA threshold of 0.2 and a maximum angulation tolerance of 10.

Abstract = {{Objectives To use pre- and post-operative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   to monitor median nerve integrity in patients suffering from carpal
   tunnel syndrome (CTS).
   Methods Diffusivity and anisotropy images along the median nerve were
   compared among 12 patients, 12 age-matched and 12 young control subjects
   and correlated with electrophysiological neurography results. Slice-wise
   DTI parameter values were calculated to focus on local changes.
   Results Results of pre-operative patients and age-matched control
   subjects differed only in the distal nerve. Moreover, pre-operative
   patients differed significantly from young controls and post-operative
   patients. The main abnormalities were increased diffusivity and
   decreased anisotropy in the carpal tunnel and distal median nerve.
   Post-operative clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but
   not in anisotropy. Slice-wise analysis showed high pre-operative
   diffusivity at the distal nerve. All groups had relatively large
   inter-subject variation in both diffusivity and anisotropy.
   Conclusions DTI can provide information complementary to clinical
   examination, electrophysiological recordings and anatomical MRI of
   diseases and injuries of peripheral nerves. However, similar age-related
   changes in diffusivity and anisotropy may weaken DTI specificity.
   Slice-wise analysis is necessary for detection of local changes in nerve
   integrity.
   Key Points Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging provides
   information complementary to conventional diagnostic methods.
   Age caused similar changes to diffusivity and anisotropy as carpal
   tunnel syndrome.
   Post-operative clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but
   not in anisotropy.
   Inter-subject variation in diffusivity and anisotropy was considerable.}},

Abstract = {{Background: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a common
   inherited axonal or mixed axonal-demyelinating neuropathy. The disease
   is caused by mutations in the GJB1 gene encoding the gap junction
   protein connexin32, which is expressed in both Schwann cells in the
   peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous
   system. Several reports have described CMTX patients presenting with
   transient and recurrent central nervous system (CNS) symptoms with
   transient white matter lesions in the brain.
   Patients: We describe a man with CMTX who presented with transient CNS
   symptoms and abnormal cerebral white matter lesions in MRI. He was
   subjected to a detailed MRI examination using two specialized
   techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (MRS).
   Results: In the early stage of his CNS symptoms, MRS studies revealed
   reduced N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) levels in deep white matter, and DTI
   revealed reduced fractional anisotropy within lesions. Interestingly,
   these reductions began to recover from day 19 after admission, and
   follow-up DTI and MRS studies on day 101 revealed a reversal of the
   abnormalities.
   Conclusion: The findings of reversible reductions in fractional
   anisotropy and NM levels in our patient suggest reversible axonal damage
   associated with deficient oligodendrocyte gap junctions. (C) 2012

   MP-SWI, MR neurography (MRN) based on 3D diffusion-weighted steady-state
   free precession imaging and contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA)
   sequences were performed for each subject. The means of signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR)(n), SNRv, SNRm, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)(n,m) and
   CNRv,m were calculated and the certainty of identifying nerves and
   vessels was determined. CNRn,m between MP-SWI and MRN, and CNRv,m
   between MP-SWI and CE-MRA were compared.
   RESULTS: MP-SWI provides slightly poorer CNRv,m than CE-MRA, whereas
   MP-SWI provides a better CNRn,m than MRN. In thin-slice-thickness
   maximum-intensity projection arbitrary planes, the sciatic nerve and its
   branches were clearly identified (score 1 or 2 of 2) in 17 subjects
   (85\%); the femoral artery and the main branches were identified (score
   1 or 2 of 2) in all 20 subjects (100\%). The nerves are isointense to
   slightly hypointense to muscle, and the vessels show a more obvious
   hyperintense signal than muscle in MP-SWI.
   CONCLUSION: The proposed MP-SWI demonstrates the feasibility of
   simultaneously visualizing nerves and vessels of the lower extremities
   without using an exogenous contrast agent. It may enable straightforward
   localization of a disease process to a specific nerve and vessel.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
   activation during somatosensory electrical stimulation of the median
   nerve in acute stroke patients and to determine its correlation with
   ischemic damage and clinical recovery over time.
   Methods: Fourteen acute stroke patients underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) during contralesional median-nerve electrical
   stimulation 12-48 h after stroke. Findings were then validated by
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and motor evoked potential by
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
   Results: Poor clinical recovery at three months was noted in four
   patients with no activation in the early days after stroke, whereas good
   clinical recovery was observed in eight patients with a normal
   activation pattern in the primary sensory motor area in the acute phase.
   In two patients BOLD activation correlated weakly with clinical
   recovery. Findings from TMS and DTI partially correlated with clinical
   recovery and functional scores.
   Conclusions: Clinically relevant insights into the ``functional
   reserve{''} of stroke patients gained with peripheral nerve stimulation
   during fMRI may carry prognostic value already in the acute period of a
   cerebrovascular accident.
   Significance: BOLD activation maps could provide insights into the
   functional organization of the residual systems and could contribute to
   medical decision making in neurological and rehabilitative treatment.

Abstract = {{Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent imaging
   modality for soft tissues. Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging is an MRI
   technique that is sensitive to the bound protons of macromolecules and
   therefore can aid in the assessment of nerve damage.Methods:
   Measurements of the MT ratio (MTR), which provides an index of the MT
   effects in tissues, were performed in the wrist and foot of 5
   volunteers. Results: The MTR of foot (interdigital) nerves (22.2 +/-
   2.1\%) was smaller than that of the median nerve (41.1 +/- 1.4\%). No
   difference was observed between MTR in muscles adjacent to foot nerves
   (46.0 +/- 1.5\%) and muscles adjacent to the median nerve (44.2 +/-
   1.9\%). Conclusions: In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of
   measuring the MTR of foot nerves. The difference of MTR between median
   and foot nerves indicates a difference in structure/composition. The MTR
   of peripheral nerves may serve as a biomarker of nerve damage, collagen
   integrity, and demyelination.}},

Abstract = {{MRI may provide treatment outcome measures in neuromuscular conditions.
   The authors assessed MRI magnetisation transfer ratios (MTRs) in
   lower-limb musculature as markers of pathology in peripheral
   neuropathies and compared the findings with associated clinical data.
   Ten patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and nine
   patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
   were compared with 10 healthy subjects. The MTR in the calf muscles was
   significantly lower than controls in the two patient groups (both p <
   0.001). The median MTRs (IQR) were 50.5(1.6) percentage units (p.u.)
   (control), 41.5 (10.6) p.u. (CMT1A) and 39.3(8.7) p.u. (CIDP). Moreover,
   anterior lower leg MTR correlated strongly with strength of ankle
   dorsiflexion, measured with the Medical Research Council scale, in CIDP
   (rho=0.88, p < 0.001) and also in CMT1A (rho=.50, p < 0.05), where MTR
   also showed an association with disease duration (rho=-0.86, p < 0.001).
   Short tau inversion recovery MRI of the same muscles showed
   abnormalities associated with regions of reduced MTR (p < 0.001), and
   MTR was also reduced in other muscles otherwise deemed normal appearing
   (p < 0.001), indicating that MTR may be more sensitive to muscle damaged
   by denervation than conventional MRI. The significant reductions in
   muscle MTR in peripheral neuropathies and the associated correlations
   with clinical measures indicate that MTR has potential as an imaging
   outcome measure in future therapeutic trials.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe a new semiautomated method for segmenting and
   measuring the volume of the muscle, bone, and adipose (subcutaneous and
   intermuscular) tissue in calf muscle compartments using magnetic
   resonance (MR) images and determine the intrarater and interrater
   reproducibility of the measures.
   Materials and Methods: Proton-density weighted MR images were acquired
   from the right calf of 21 subjects. Three raters segmented and measured
   the volumes of bones, adipose tissue, and five individual muscle
   compartments. Two raters repeated the segmentations. The intra-and
   interrater reproducibility of the measures (intraclass correlation
   coefficients; ICC) were determined using generalizability theory.
   Results: All ICC values were greater than 0.96. The average standard
   error of the mean (SEM) of all measures was 1.21 cm(3) and none were
   greater than 2.3 cm(3). Essentially all variation (>= 97\% for all
   measures) was due to subject differences, indicating low error in the
   measurements.
   Conclusion: The volumetric measurements for the bones, adipose tissue,
   and muscle in each of the compartments using MRI were highly
   reproducible. MRI can provide quantitative, reproducible volumetric
   measures of bone, adipose tissue, and individual muscle compartments in
   the calf. We believe these methods can be used to quantify specific
   muscle or adipose volumetric measures for other clinical or research
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical feasibility of
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the evaluation of peripheral nerves
   in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating
   polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP).
   Using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, we obtained DTI scans of
   the tibial nerves of 10 CIDP patients and 10 sex- and age-matched
   healthy volunteers. We prepared fractional anisotropy (FA) maps,
   measured the FA values of tibial nerves, and compared these values in
   the two study groups. In nine patients, we also performed tibial nerve
   conduction studies and analyzed the correlation between the FA values
   and parameters of the nerve conduction study.
   The tibial nerve FA values in CIDP patients (median 0.401, range
   0.312-0.510) were significantly lower than those in healthy volunteers
   (median 0.530, range 0.469-0.647) (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.01). They
   were significantly correlated with the amplitude of action potential
   (Spearman correlation coefficient, p = 0.04, r = 0.86) but not with
   nerve conduction velocity (p = 0.79, r = 0.11).
   Our preliminary data suggest that the noninvasive DTI assessment of
   peripheral nerves may provide useful information in patients with CIDP.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of nerve fibers in the spinal cord run longitudinally,
   playing an important role in connecting the brain to the peripheral
   nerves. There is a growing interest in applying diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) to the evaluation of spinal cord microarchitecture. The current
   study sought to compare the organization of longitudinal nerve fibers
   between healthy and myelopathic spinal cords using entropy-based
   analysis of principal eigenvector mapping. A total of 22 subjects were
   recruited, including 14 healthy subjects, seven cervical myelopathy (CM)
   patients with single-level compression, and one patient suffering from
   multi-level compression. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (MR) images
   of the cervical spinal cord were obtained using a pulsed gradient,
   spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence with a 31 MR system.
   Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually to cover the spinal cord,
   and Shannon entropy was calculated in principal eigenvector maps. The
   results revealed no significant differences in orientation entropy
   values along the whole length of cervical spinal cord in healthy
   subjects (C2-3: 0.73 +/- 0.05; C3-4: 0.71 +/- 0.07; C4-5: 0.72 +/-
   0.048; C5-6: 0.71 +/- 0.07; C6-7: 0.72 +/- 0.07). In contrast,
   orientation entropy values in myelopathic cord were significantly higher
   at the compression site (0.91 +/- 0.03), and the adjacent levels (above:
   0.85 +/- 0.03; below: 0.83 +/- 0.05). This study provides a novel
   approach to analyze the orientation information in diffusion MR images
   of healthy and diseased spinal cord. These results indicate that
   orientation entropy can be applied to determine the contribution of each
   compression level to the overall disorganization of principal nerve
   tracts of myelopathic spinal cord in cases with multi-level compression.

Abstract = {{Purpose. - This study aimed to assess the feasibility of magnetic
   resonance (MR) neurography in children, and the potential roles of
   diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fiber-tracking (FT) techniques.
   Methods. - Five pediatric patients (age range: 6-12 years) underwent
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for various clinical indications:
   neurogenic bladder (case 1); persistent hand pain following minor trauma
   (case 2); progressive atrophy of the lower left extremity muscles (case
   3); bilateral hip pain (case 4); and palpable left supraclavicular mass
   (case 5). All studies were performed using a 1.5-T Avanto MRI scanner
   (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The protocol included 3D T2-weighted STIR
   and SPACE imaging, T1-weighted fat-saturation post-gadolinium imaging
   and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tractography. ADC (N x 10(-3)
   mm(2)/s) and FA values were calculated from regions of interest (ROIs)
   centered on the nerves. Nerve-fiber tracks were calculated using a
   fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (NeuroD software).
   Results. - MR neurography allowed satisfactory visualization of all
   neural structures, and FA and ADC measurements were feasible. The final
   diagnoses were Tarlov cysts, median-nerve compression, sciatic
   perineurioma, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and plexiform neurofibroma in
   a patient with NF-1.
   Discussion. - FA and ADC measurements are of little value because of the
   lack of normal reference values. Nerve-fiber tractography (FT) may be of
   value in the characterization of tumor pathology, and is also helpful in
   the planning of surgical treatments.
   Conclusion. - MR neurography is feasible in pediatric patients. However,
   a considerable amount of work has yet to be done to establish its role
   in the clinical management of the wide range of peripheral nerve
   diseases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   in assessing peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. We assessed the
   changes in the DTI parameters and histological analyses after nerve
   injury to examine degeneration and regeneration in the rat sciatic
   nerves.
   Materials and Methods: For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 16 rats
   were randomly divided into two groups: group P (permanently crushed; n =
   7) and group T (temporally crushed; it = 9). Serial MRI of the right leg
   was performed before the operation, and then performed at the timepoints
   of 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the crush injury. The changes in
   fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (lambda(parallel to)), and
   radial diffusivity (lambda(perpendicular to)) were quantified. For
   histological analyses, the number of axons and the myelinated axon areas
   were quantified.
   Results: Decreased FA and increased lambda(perpendicular to) were
   observed in the degenerative phase, and increased FA and decreased
   lambda(perpendicular to) were observed in the regenerative phase. The
   changes in FA and lambda(perpendicular to) were strongly correlated with
   histological changes, including axonal and myelin regeneration.
   Conclusion: DTI parameters, especially lambda(perpendicular to), can be
   good indicators for peripheral nerve regeneration and can be applied as
   noninvasive diagnostic tools for a variety of neurological diseases.}},

   single-shot diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence that can
   visualize the olfactory tracts with fiber tracking. Five healthy
   individuals were examined, and the olfactory tracts could be fiber
   tracked with the diffusion-weighted sequence. For comparison and as a
   negative control, an anosmic patient was examined. No olfactory tracts
   were visualized on T2-weighted nor diffusion-weighted fiber tracking

Abstract = {{Plexiform Neurofibroma (PN) is a major complication of
   NeuroFibromatosis-1 (NF1), a common genetic disease that involving the
   nervous system. PNs are peripheral nerve sheath tumors extending along
   the length of the nerve in various parts of the body. Treatment decision
   is based on tumor volume assessment using MRI, which is currently time
   consuming and error prone, with limited semi-automatic segmentation
   support. We present in this paper a new method for the segmentation and
   tumor mass quantification of PN from STIR MRI scans. The method starts
   with a user-based delineation of the tumor area in a single slice and
   automatically detects the PN lesions in the entire image based on the
   tumor connectivity. Experimental results on seven datasets yield a mean
   volume overlap difference of 25\% as compared to manual segmentation by
   expert radiologist with a mean computation and interaction time of 12
   minutes vs. over an hour for manual annotation. Since the user
   interaction in the segmentation process is minimal, our method has the
   potential to successfully become part of the clinical workflow.}},

Abstract = {{We are developing a simulator of peripheral nerve block utilizing a
   mixed-reality approach: the combination of a physical model, an
   MRI-derived virtual model, mechatronics and spatial tracking. Our design
   uses tangible (physical) interfaces to simulate surface anatomy, haptic
   feedback during needle insertion, mechatronic display of muscle twitch
   corresponding to the specific nerve stimulated, and visual and haptic
   feedback for the injection syringe. The twitch response is calculated
   incorporating the sensed output of a real neurostimulator. The virtual
   model is isomorphic with the physical model and is derived from
   segmented MRI data. This model provides the subsurface anatomy and,
   combined with electromagnetic tracking of a sham ultrasound probe and a
   standard nerve block needle, supports simulated ultrasound display and
   measurement of needle location and proximity to nerves and vessels. The
   needle tracking and virtual model also support objective performance
   metrics of needle targeting technique.}},

Abstract = {{Various neurological problems of the brain are known to occur in
   patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known
   about diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings in patients with ESRD.
   Using DTI, we attempted to investigate DTI findings in patients with
   ESRD who showed no specific lesions on conventional brain MRI. We
   recruited 10 consecutive patients with ESRD for whom at least 3 years
   had passed since the start of peritoneal dialysis and who showed no
   neurological abnormality on neurologic examination. We excluded 6
   patients who showed cerebral infarct (4 patients) and diabetes mellitus
   with peripheral neuropathy (2 patients); finally, 4 patients (39.75 +/-
   9.84 years) were included in this study. We evaluated hand motor
   function and cognition. DTI data were acquired using a 1.5-T Philips
   Gyroscan Intera system and diffusion tensor tractographies (DTTs) for
   five neural tracts (corticospinal tract, fornix, superior longitudinal
   fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior
   fronto-occipital fasciculus) were evaluated. With the exception of 1
   patient who revealed a mild abnormality at a higher cognitive function,
   no abnormalities in motor and cognitive function were observed. Among
   the 10 DTTs, except for those of the corticospinal tract, all 4 patients
   had more than one lesion. Patients with ESRD showed abnormalities on
   DTTs that were associated with cognition; however, they did not show
   significant cognitive abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of human peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles by means
   of diffusion tensor imaging and tractograpy has been a recent area of
   research. These techniques have been successfully applied in both
   volunteers and patients, providing non-invasively, quantitative
   microstructural parameters (mainly mean fractional anisotropy and
   apparent diffusion coefficient) and offering a three-dimensional
   visualization tool of nerves and muscles fibers.
   DTI and tractography may reveal abnormalities that are beyond the
   resolution of conventional MR techniques and hence open the way to
   potential clinical applications.
   In this article, we will first summarize the current state of DTI and
   tractography in the evaluation of peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles
   as well as their potential future clinical applications. Then, we will
   address important technical considerations, which understanding is
   necessary to appropriately apply DTI and tractograhy, and in order to
   understand the current limitations of these innovative and promising

Abstract = {{Development of outcome measures to assess ongoing nerve regeneration in
   the living animal that can be translated to human can provide extremely
   useful tools for monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions to
   promote nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic
   resonance based technique, provides image contrast for nerve tracts and
   can be applied serially on the same subject with potential to monitor
   nerve fiber content. In this study, we examined the use of ex vivo
   high-resolution DTI for imaging intact and regenerating peripheral
   nerves in mice and correlated the MRI findings with electrophysiology
   and histology. DTI was done on sciatic nerves with crush, without crush,
   and after complete transection in different mouse strains. DTI measures,
   including fractional anisotropy (FA), parallel diffusivity, and
   perpendicular diffusivity were acquired and compared in segments of
   uninjured and crushed/transected nerves and correlated with morphometry.
   A comparison of axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush showed a
   comparable pattern of regeneration in different mice strains. FA values
   were significantly lower in completely denervated nerve segments
   compared to uninjured sciatic nerve and this signal was restored toward
   normal in regenerating nerve segments (crushed nerves). Histology data
   indicate that the FA values and the parallel diffusivity showed a
   positive correlation with the total number of regenerating axons. These
   studies suggest that DTI is a sensitive measure of axon regeneration in
   mouse models and provide basis for further development of imaging
   technology for application to living animals and humans. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and potential
   clinical applications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography
   in the normal and pathologic brachial plexus prospectively.
   Six asymptomatic volunteers and 12 patients with symptoms related to the
   brachial plexus underwent DTI on a 1.5T system in addition to the
   routine anatomic plexus imaging protocol. Maps of the apparent diffusion
   coefficient (ADC) and of fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as
   tractography of the brachial plexus were obtained. Images were evaluated
   by two experienced neuroradiologists in a prospective fashion. Three
   patients underwent surgery, and nine patients underwent conservative
   medical treatment.
   Reconstructed DTI (17/18) were of good quality (one case could not be
   reconstructed due to artifacts). In all volunteers and in 11 patients,
   the roots and the trunks were clearly delineated with tractography. Mean
   FA and mean ADC values were as follows: 0.30 +/- 0.079 and 1.70 +/- 0.35
   mm(2)/s in normal fibers, 0.22 +/- 0.04 and 1.49 +/- 0.49 mm(2)/s in
   benign neurogenic tumors, and 0.24 +/- 0.08 and 1.51 +/- 0.52 mm(2)/s in
   malignant tumors, respectively. Although there was no statistically
   significant difference in FA and ADC values of normal fibers and fibers
   at the level of pathology, tractography revealed major differences
   regarding fiber architecture. In benign neurogenic tumors (n = 4),
   tractography revealed fiber displacement alone (n = 2) or fiber
   displacement and encasement by the tumor (n = 2), whereas in the
   malignant tumors, either fiber disruption/destruction with complete
   disorganization (n = 6) or fiber displacement (n = 1) were seen. In
   patients with fiber displacement alone, surgery confirmed the
   tractography findings, and excision was successful without sequelae.
   Our preliminary data suggest that DTI with tractography is feasible in a
   clinical routine setting. DTI may demonstrate normal tracts, tract
   displacement, deformation, infiltration, disruption, and disorganization
   of fibers due to tumors located within or along the brachial plexus,
   therefore, yielding additional information to the current standard
   anatomic imaging protocols.}},

   7,000/103; b value 1,025 s/mm(2)). Postprocessing included fiber
   tractography and quantitative analysis of fiber length, fiber density
   index, fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, and
   signal-to-noise ratio. Two readers in consensus graded the quality of
   fiber tract images of the two wrists as equal, slightly different, or
   very different. Fiber tractography and all analyses were repeated after
   3 weeks, and the images from the two sessions were compared.
   RESULTS. No statistically significant side-to-side differences in
   quantitative data were found (p = 0.054-0.999). In all subjects, the
   quality of fiber tract images of the right and left median nerves was
   either slightly or very different. Between the initial and the second
   quantitative analyses, no statistically significant differences (p =
   0.086-0.898) were found, and the quality of fiber tract images was rated
   equal for nine of 15 subjects (60\%) and slightly different for six of
   15 subjects (40\%).
   CONCLUSION. Preliminary results indicate that quantitative evaluation of
   DTI of the median nerve is precise. The absence of statistically
   significant intrasubject side-to-side variability in quantitative data
   suggests that the healthy contralateral nerve can be used as an internal
   control. Observed side-to-side variability in the quality of fiber tract
   images, however, rules out side-to-side comparisons in fiber
   tractography.}},

Abstract = {{Globoid cell leukodystrophy is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder
   caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase. In
   both human patients and the authentic murine Twitcher model,
   pathological findings include demyelination as well as axonal damage in
   both the central and peripheral nervous system. Diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) has emerged as a powerful noninvasive technique that is sensitive
   to these white matter disease processes. Increases in radial diffusivity
   (lambda perpendicular to) and decreases in axial diffusivity (lambda
   parallel to) correlate with histopathological evidence of demyelination
   and axonal damage, respectively. Compared to age-matched, normal
   littermates, DTI of optic nerve and trigeminal nerve in end-stage
   Twitcher mice displayed a statistically significant increase in lambda
   perpendicular to and decrease in lambda parallel to, consistent with
   previously characterized demyelination and axonal damage in these
   regions. In the Twitcher spinal cord, a statistically significant
   decrease in lambda parallel to was identified in both the dorsal and
   ventrolateral white matter, relative to normal controls. These results
   were consistent with immunofluorescence evidence of axonal damage in
   these areas as detected by staining for nonphosphorylated neurofilaments
   (SMI32). Increase in lambda perpendicular to in Twitcher spinal cord
   white matter relative to normal controls reached statistical
   significance in the dorsal columns and approached statistical
   significance in the ventrolateral region. Correlative reduced levels of
   myelin basic protein were detected by immunofluorescent staining in both
   these white matter regions in the Twitcher spinal cord. Fractional
   anisotropy, a nonspecific but sensitive indicator of white matter
   disease, was significantly reduced in the optic nerve, trigeminal nerve,
   and throughout the spinal cord white matter of Twitcher mice, relative
   to normal controls. This first reported application of spinal cord DTI
   in the setting of GLD holds potential as a noninvasive, quantitative
   assay of therapeutic efficacy in future treatment studies. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Following upper limb peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair,
   some patients regain good sensorimotor function while others do not.
   Understanding peripheral and central mechanisms that contribute to
   recovery may facilitate the development of new therapeutic
   interventions. Plasticity following peripheral nerve transection has
   been demonstrated throughout the neuroaxis in animal models of nerve
   injury. However, the brain changes that occur following peripheral nerve
   transection and surgical repair in humans have not been examined.
   Furthermore, the extent to which peripheral nerve regeneration
   influences functional and structural brain changes has not been
   characterized. Therefore, we asked whether functional changes are
   accompanied by grey and/or white matter structural changes and whether
   these changes relate to sensory recovery? To address these key issues we
   (i) assessed peripheral nerve regeneration; (ii) measured functional
   magnetic resonance imaging brain activation (blood oxygen level
   dependent signal; BOLD) in response to a vibrotactile stimulus; (iii)
   examined grey and white matter structural brain plasticity; and (iv)
   correlated sensory recovery measures with grey matter changes in
   peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair patients. Compared to
   each patient's healthy contralesional nerve, transected nerves have
   impaired nerve conduction 1.5 years after transection and repair,
   conducting with decreased amplitude and increased latency. Compared to
   healthy controls, peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair
   patients had altered blood oxygen level dependent signal activity in the
   contralesional primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, and in a
   set of brain areas known as the `task positive network'. In addition,
   grey matter reductions were identified in several brain areas, including
   the contralesional primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, in the
   same areas where blood oxygen level dependent signal reductions were
   identified. Furthermore, grey matter thinning in the post-central gyrus
   was negatively correlated with measures of sensory recovery (mechanical
   and vibration detection) demonstrating a clear link between function and
   structure. Finally, we identified reduced white matter fractional
   anisotropy in the right insula in a region that also demonstrated
   reduced grey matter. These results provide insight into brain plasticity
   and structure-function-behavioural relationships following nerve injury
   and have important therapeutic implications.}},

Abstract = {{The safe performance of regional anaesthesia (RA) requires theoretical
   knowledge and good manual skills. Virtual reality (VR)-based simulators
   may offer trainees a safe environment to learn and practice different
   techniques. However, currently available VR simulators do not consider
   individual anatomy, which limits their use for realistic training. We
   have developed a VR-based simulator that can be used for individual
   anatomy and for different anatomical regions.
   Individual data were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
   magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) without contrast agent to represent
   morphology and the vascular system, respectively. For data handling,
   registration, and segmentation, an application based on the Medical
   Imaging Interaction Toolkit was developed. Suitable segmentation
   algorithms such as the fuzzy c-means clustering approach were
   integrated, and a hierarchical tree data structure was created to model
   the flexible anatomical structures of peripheral nerve cords. The
   simulator was implemented in the VR toolkit ViSTA using modules for
   collision detection, virtual humanoids, interaction, and visualization.
   A novel algorithm for electric impulse transmission is the core of the
   simulation.
   In a feasibility study, MRI morphology and MRA were acquired from five
   subjects for the inguinal region. From these sources, three-dimensional
   anatomical data sets were created and nerves modelled. The resolution
   obtained from both MRI and MRA was sufficient for realistic simulations.
   Our high-fidelity simulator application allows trainees to perform
   virtual peripheral nerve blocks based on these data sets and models.
   Subject-specific training of RA is supported in a virtual environment.
   We have adapted segmentation algorithms and developed a VR-based
   simulator for the inguinal region for use in training for different
   peripheral nerve blocks. In contrast to available VR-based simulators,
   our simulation offers anatomical variety.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Methods were invented that made it possible to image
   peripheral nerves in the body and to image neural tracts in the brain.
   The history, physical basis, and dyadic tensor concept underlying the
   methods are reviewed. Over a 15-year period, these techniques-magnetic
   resonance neurography (MRN) and diffusion tensor imaging-were deployed
   in the clinical and research community in more than 2500 published
   research reports and applied to approximately 50 000 patients. Within
   this group, approximately 5000 patients having MRN were carefully
   tracked on a prospective basis.
   METHODS: A uniform Neurography imaging methodology was applied in the
   study group, and all images were reviewed and registered by referral
   source, clinical indication, efficacy of imaging, and quality. Various
   classes of image findings were identified and subjected to a variety of
   small targeted prospective outcome studies. Those findings demonstrated
   to be clinically significant were then tracked in the larger clinical
   volume data set.
   RESULTS: MRN demonstrates mechanical distortion of nerves,
   hyperintensity consistent with nerve irritation, nerve swelling,
   discontinuity, relations of nerves to masses, and image features
   revealing distortion of nerves at entrapment points. These findings are
   often clinically relevant and warrant full consideration in the
   diagnostic process. They result in specific pathological diagnoses that
   are comparable to electrodiagnostic testing in clinical efficacy. A
   review of clinical outcome studies with diffusion tensor imaging also
   shows convincing utility.
   CONCLUSION: MRN and diffusion tensor imaging neural tract imaging have
   been validated as indispensable clinical diagnostic methods that provide
   reliable anatomic pathological information. There is no alternative
   diagnostic method in many situations. With the elapsing of 15 years,
   tens of thousands of imaging studies, and thousands of publications,
   these methods should no longer be considered experimental.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Acquired copper deficiency in adults is associated with a
   subacute to chronic progressive myeloneuropathy and optic neuropathy.
   Objective: To describe an individual after gastric bypass surgery who
   developed a chronic progressive myeloneuropathy, an acute optic
   neuropathy, along with anemia and leukopenia.
   Design: Case report.
   Setting: Academic center.
   Patient: A 55-year-old woman, following gastric bypass surgery 22 years
   earlier, developed progressive numbness, weakness, and sphincter
   disturbance over 6 years. She awoke one morning with bilateral
   blindness. Examination findings showed evidence of severe myelopathy and
   peripheral neuropathy.
   Main Outcome Measures: Magnetic resonance imaging, optical coherence
   tomography, electrophysiologic studies, nerve and muscle biopsy
   specimens, and vision testing.
   Results: Over 1 year of follow-up, copper infusion therapy seemed to
   stabilize the progressive myeloneuropathy and improved leukopenia and
   anemia. It had no effect on the optic neuropathy. Optic nerve tissue
   injury was observed on magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and
   on optical coherence tomography.
   Conclusions: Copper deficiency should be considered in cases of atypical
   optic neuropathy. Serum copper levels should be monitored in patients
   with a compatible neurologic syndrome who have undergone gastric bypass
   surgery. Although visual acuity did not improve after copper infusion in
   our patient, prompt recognition of copper deficiency may prevent further
   deterioration.}},

Abstract = {{The median nerve is one of the most commonly affected peripheral nerves
   in various pathologies such as entrapment syndromes or transections. The
   diagnostic procedures applied in these situations are electromyography,
   physical examination methods, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance
   imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used mostly in imaging
   the central nervous system (CNS) to visualize white matter tracts.
   Several studies have shown the clinical applications of DTI in neuronal
   disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and CNS tumors. Recently, peripheral
   nerves have been visualized with DTI. Also, in several pathologies such
   as carpal tunnel syndrome and transection of the median nerve, on
   postoperative follow-up anisotropy indexes were shown to be affected.
   However, new studies with larger series a-re needed.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the T2 relaxation characteristics of the median
   nerve. Knowledge of the T2 relaxation time is essential to optimize
   clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and to enhance the
   visibility of pathophysiological changes in tissues. The T2 relaxation
   time of the median nerve is short relative to the T2 of other tissues
   like white and gray matter, for instance, and it decreases with
   increasing field strength of the MR scanner. A T2 relaxation time of
   similar to 50 milliseconds (ms) and similar to 20 ms were reported at
   1.5 T and 7 T, respectively. Detailed measurements at 3.0 T revealed a
   blexponential decay characterized by two T2 components, at similar to 30
   ms and similar to 100 ms, with normalized amplitudes of similar to 80\%
   and similar to 20\%, respectively. These two components possibly result
   from spatial compartmentation of water into intra-axonal and interaxonal
   spaces. The ability to assess microanatomical compartments within the
   median nerve could provide a method to study in vivo biophysical
   properties of nerves and could offer a means to investigate
   neurodegenerative diseases.}},

Abstract = {{We applied diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), a recently developed MRI
   technique that reveals the microstructures of tissues based on its
   ability to monitor the random movements of water molecules, to the
   visualization of peripheral nerves after injury. The rat sciatic nerve
   was subjected to contusive injury, and the data obtained from diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) were used to determine the tracks of nerve fibers
   (DTT). The DTT images obtained using the fractional anisotropy (FA)
   threshold value of 0.4 clearly revealed the recovery process of the
   contused nerves. Immediately after the injury, fiber tracking from the
   designated proximal site could not be continued beyond the lesion
   epicenter, but the intensity improved thereafter, returning to its
   pre-injury level by 3 weeks later. We compared the FA value, a parameter
   computed from the DTT data, with the results of histological and
   functional examinations of the injured nerves, during recovery. The FA
   values of the peripheral nerves were more strongly correlated with
   axon-related (axon density and diameter) than with myelin-related
   (myelin density and thickness) parameters, supporting the theories that
   axonal membranes play a major role in anisotropic water diffusion and
   that myelination can modulate the degree of anisotropy. Moreover,
   restoration of the FA value at the lesion epicenter was strongly
   correlated with parameters of motor and sensory functional recovery.
   These correlations of the FA values with both the histological and
   functional changes demonstrate the potential usefulness of DTT for
   evaluating clinical events associated with Wallerian degeneration and
   the regeneration of peripheral nerves. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate manganese (Mn2+)-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) and diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) as tools for detection of axonal injury and
   regeneration after intravitreal peripheral nerve graft (PNG)
   implantation in the rat optic nerve (ON).
   Materials and Methods: In adult Fischer rats, retinal ganglion cell
   (RGC) survival was evaluated in Flurogold (FG) back-filled retinal whole
   mounts after ON crush (ONC), intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl2
   injection (150 nmol) at 0 and 20 days post lesion (dpl). MEMRI and
   echoplanar 137171 (DTI-EPI) was obtained of noninjured ON one day after
   intravitreal MnCl2 injection, and at 1 and 21 dpl after ONC,
   intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl2 injections given at 0 and 20
   dpl. GAP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed after the last MRI.
   Results: ONC reduced RGC density in retina by 94\% at 21 dpl compared to
   noninjured ON without MnCl2 injections. Both intravitreal PNG and
   intravitreal MnCl2 injections improved RGC survival in retina, which was
   reduced by 90\% (ONC + MnCl2), 82\% (ONC + PNG), and 74\%
   (ONC+PNG+MnCl2) compared to noninjured ON. DTI-derived parameters
   {[}fractional anisotropy {[}FA], mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity
   lambda(parallel to) and radial diffusivity lambda(1)) were unaffected by
   the presence of Mn2+ in the ON. At 1 dpl, CNRMEMRI and lambda(parallel
   to) were reduced at the injury site, while at 21 dp1 they were increased
   at the injury site compared to values measured at I dpl. GAP-43
   immunoreactive axons were present in the ON distal to the ONC injury
   site.
   Conclusion: MEMRI and DTI enabled detection of functional and structural
   degradation after rat ON injury, and there was correlation between the
   MRI-derived and immunohistochemical measures of axon regeneration.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{71-76}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Wallerian degeneration is the degeneration of the nerve fiber distally
   to damage of the axon. It classically has been described in the
   peripheral nervous system (PNS), but also takes place in the central
   nervous system (CNS). Wallerian degeneration in the CNS is much slower
   than in the PNS taking months to years and a secondary regeneration of
   the distal nerve fiber does not take place in the CNS. Thus, Wallerian
   degeneration may be a crucial factor influencing the functional loss
   after brain damage and can be detected using modern MR techniques. This
   article reviews the process of Wallerian degeneration in the CNS and the
   possibilities of imaging Wallerian degeneration in the human brain using
   MRI.
   While a decrease of signal intensities in proton-density-weighted images
   can be detected after 25 days and increased signal intensities in
   T2-weigthed images can be seen after 80 days, diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) can detect Wallerian degeneration much earlier. Several studies
   have demonstrated the decrease of fractional anisotropy ( FA) in the
   corticospinal tracts after infarction of the medial cerebral artery
   (MCA) 2-6 month after stroke, 2-6 weeks after stroke, and 2-16 days
   after stroke. Moreover, a continuous decrease of FA over time in serial
   DTI measurements after MCA infarction could be demonstrated.
   Changes in FA seem to be a parameter to quantify degeneration of tracts
   over time in single, compact fiber bundles such as the corticospinal
   tract, cerebellar peduncles, spinal cord white matter, the optic
   radiation, and corpus callosum. Thus, the detection and quantification
   of Wallerian degeneration may be a tool for monitoring functional loss
   or functional regain after brain damage.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been shown to provide valuable
   structural information in biological fibrous soft tissues, such as the
   central and peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscle, based on the
   acquisition of a series of images that sample q-space. Existing q-space
   sampling schemes have been compared using several metrics based on
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which models the restricted diffusion
   inside fibres as anisotropic unrestricted diffusion. Otherwise, sampling
   schemes have been optimized using model-independent cost functions. We
   propose using a model-based framework that connects the experimental
   noise, the uncertainty in the estimation of the model parameters, and
   the q-space sampling schemes together, to obtain model-based optimal
   sampling schemes for the case when the fibre orientation is known a
   priori to be within a finite region. We apply and validate this
   framework for the recently proposed quantitative analysis of q-space MRI
   data (QUAQ) model.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of T2 relaxation times in tissues have provided a unique,
   noninvasive method to investigate the microenvironment of water
   molecules in vivo. As more clinical imaging is performed at higher field
   strengths, tissue relaxation times need to be reassessed in order to
   optimize tissue contrast. The purpose of this study was to investigate
   the water proton T2 relaxation time in human median nerve at 7 T.
   High-resolution images of the wrist were obtained using a home-built
   dedicated microstrip coil. Gradient echo images provided a good
   anatomical delineation of the wrist structure, with a clear definition
   of the median nerve, tendons, bone, and connective tissue within the
   wrist in an acquisition time of 2 min. Measurements of the T2 relaxation
   time were performed with a spin echo imaging sequence. The T2 relaxation
   time of the median nerve was 18.3 +/- 1.9 ms, which is significantly
   shorter than the T2 measured in previous studies performed at 1.5 T and
   3 T. Further, the T2 relaxation time of the median nerve is shorter than
   the T2 relaxation time of other tissues, such as brain tissue, at the
   same field strength. Since the T2 relaxation time of water protons is
   sensitive to the water microenvironment, relaxation measurements and, in
   general, a more quantitative magnetic resonance imaging approach might
   help in detecting and investigating diseases of peripheral nervous
   system, such as compressive and inflammatory neuropathies, in humans.}},

Abstract = {{A novel magnetic resonance imaging approach, called
   diffusion-direction-dependent imaging (DDI), is introduced. Due to
   inherent anisotropic diffusion properties, peripheral nerves can be
   visualized on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The largest signal
   attenuation on DTI correlates with the direction of a nerve fiber, and
   the least signal attenuation correlates with the direction perpendicular
   to the nerve fiber. Since low signal-to-noise ratio is a concern in
   peripheral nerve DTI, we explored a new approach focusing on the
   perpendicular diffusion direction. A 36-gradient diffusion direction
   scheme was used. A mean expected curve specific for peripheral nerves
   was calculated based on the sciatic nerve and its division into the
   common peroneal nerve and the tibial nerve in three healthy volunteers.
   By a simple postprocessing method, a comparison of the mean expected
   curve and the measured curve was made voxel by voxel, and the sciatic
   nerve and its division were reconstructed, excluding other tissues. More
   studies are needed to investigate whether other postprocessing methods
   or other diffusion direction schemes are more suited for peripheral
   nerve imaging with DDI. Further studies may also be of interest to
   investigate whether DDI can be a complementary method to conventional
   T-1-weighted and T-2-weighted sequences in the imaging of peripheral
   nerve pathology or even in the visualization of other tissues, possibly
   with different diffusion direction schemes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Although the diffusivity and anisotropy of water has been investigated
   thoroughly in ordered axonal systems (i.e., nervous tissue), there have
   been very few studies on the directional dependence of diffusion of
   metabolites. In this study, the mean apparent diffusion coefficient
   (Trace/3 ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the intracellular
   metabolites N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine
   (tCr), choline (Cho), taurine (Tau), and glutamate and glutamine (Glx)
   were measured parallel and perpendicular to the length of excised frog
   sciatic nerve using a water suppressed, diffusion-weighted, spin-echo
   pulse sequence at 18.8 T. The degree of anisotropy (FA) of NAA (0.41 +/-
   0.09) was determined to be less than tCr (0.59 +/- 0.07) and Cho (0.61
   +/- 0.11), which is consistent with previously reported human studies of
   white matter. In contrast, Glx diffusion was found to be almost
   isotropic with an FA value of 0.20 +/- 0.06. The differences of FA
   between the metabolites is most likely due to their differing
   micro-environments and could be beneficial as an indicator of

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is
   poorly understood. We have recently reported a significant reduction in
   spinal cord cross-sectional area at the stage of clinically detectable
   DPN. In this study, we investigated whether spinal cord atrophy occurs
   in early (subclinical) DPN.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Eighty-one male type I diabetic subjects,
   24 nondiabetic control subjects, and 8 subjects with hereditary sensory
   motor neuropathy (HSMN) type 1A underwent detailed clinical and
   neurophysiological assessments. Diabetic subjects were subsequently
   divided into three groups based on neuropathy severity (19 with no DPN,
   23 with subclinical DPN, and 39 with clinically detectable DPN). All
   subjects under-went magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and
   cord area measurements at disc level C2/C3.
   RESULTS - Mean corrected spinal cord area index (SCAI) (corrected for
   age, height, and weight) was 67.5 mm {[}95\% CI 64.1-70.9] in diabetic
   subjects without DPN. Those with subclinical (62.4 min {[}59.5-65.3])
   and clinically detectable DPN (57.2 mm {[}54.9-59.6]) had lower mean
   SCAIs compared with subjects with no DPN (P = 0.03 and P < 0.001,
   respectively). No significant difference was found between diabetic
   subjects without DPN and nondiabetic control subjects (69.2 mm
   {[}66.3-72.0], P = 0.47). Mean SCAIs in subjects with HSMN type 1A
   (71.07 mm {[}65.3-76.9]) were not significantly different from those for
   nondiabetic control subjects and diabetic subjects without DPN. Among
   diabetic subjects, SCAI was significantly related to sural sensory
   conduction velocities and the Neuropathy Composite and Symptom Scores.
   CONCLUSIONS - Spinal cord involvement occurs early in DPN. There is also
   a significant relation between reduction in SCAI and neurophysiological
   assessments of DPN.}},

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis: In addition to nephropathy, retinopathy and peripheral
   neuropathy, a microvascular complication of type 1 diabetes that may be
   tentatively referred to as `diabetic encephalopathy' has gained
   increasing attention. There is growing evidence that lowered cognitive
   performance in patients with type 1 diabetes is related to chronic
   hyperglycaemia rather than recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycaemia,
   as previously speculated. The aim of our study was to use magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) to establish whether long-term hyperglycaemia,
   resulting in advanced retinopathy, contributes to structural changes in
   the brain (reduced grey matter). Subjects, materials and methods: We
   applied voxel-based morphometry on magnetic resonance images to compare
   grey matter density (GMD) between three groups of participants. GMD is
   used as a marker of cortical atrophy. We compared 13 type 1 diabetic
   patients with a microvascular complication (i.e. proliferative
   retinopathy) with 18 type 1 diabetic patients who did not have
   retinopathy in order to assess the effects of microvascular changes on
   GMD. Both patient groups were compared with 21 healthy control subjects
   to assess the effect of diabetes in itself. Results: Patients with
   diabetic retinopathy showed reduced GMD in the right inferior frontal
   gyrus and right occipital lobe compared both with patients without
   retinopathy and with healthy controls (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions/interpretation: Our data show that patients with type 1
   diabetes, who, as a consequence of chronic hyperglycaemia, had developed
   advanced retinopathy, also showed increased focal cortical atrophy on
   brain MRI.}},

Abstract = {{Executive Summary: 1. Foot infections in patients with diabetes cause
   substantial morbidity and frequent visits to health care professionals
   and may lead to amputation of a lower extremity. 2. Diabetic foot
   infections require attention to local (foot) and systemic (metabolic)
   issues and coordinated management, preferably by a multidisciplinary
   foot-care team (A-II) (Table 1). The team managing these infections
   should include, or have ready access to, an infectious diseases
   specialist or a medical microbiologist (B-II). 3. The major predisposing
   factor to these infections is foot ulceration, which is usually related
   to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral vascular disease and various
   immunological disturbances play a secondary role. 4. Aerobic
   Gram-positive cocci (especially Staphylococcus aureus) are the
   predominant pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have
   chronic wounds or who have recently received antibiotic therapy may also
   be infected with Gram-negative rods, and those with foot ischemia or
   gangrene may have obligate anaerobic pathogens. 5. Wound infections must
   be diagnosed clinically on the basis of local (and occasionally
   systemic) signs and symptoms of inflammation. Laboratory (including
   microbiological) investigations arc of limited use for diagnosing
   infection, except in cases of osteomyelitis (B-II). 6. Send
   appropriately obtained specimens for culture before starting empirical
   antibiotic therapy in all cases of infection, except perhaps those that
   are mild and previously untreated (B-III). Tissue specimens obtained by
   biopsy, ulcer curettage, or aspiration are preferable to wound swab
   specimens (A-I). 7. Imaging studies may help diagnose or better define
   deep, soft-tissue purulent collections and are usually needed to detect
   pathological findings in bone. Plain radiography may be adequate in many
   cases, but MRI (in preference to isotope scanning) is more sensitive and
   specific, especially for detection of soft-tissue lesions (A-I). 8.
   Infections should be categorized by their severity on the basis of
   readily assessable clinical and laboratory features (B-II). Most
   important among these are the specific tissues involved, the adequacy of
   arterial per-fusion, and the presence of systemic toxicity or metabolic
   instability. Categorization helps determine the degree of risk to the
   patient and the limb and, thus, the urgency and venue of management. 9.
   Available evidence does not support treating clinically uninfected
   ulcers with antibiotic therapy (D-III). Antibiotic therapy is necessary
   for virtually all infected wounds, but it is often insufficient without
   appropriate wound care. 10. Select an empirical antibiotic regimen on
   the basis of the severity of the infection and the likely etiologic
   agent(s) (B-II). Therapy aimed solely at aerobic Gram-positive cocci may
   be sufficient for mild-to-moderate infections in patients who have not
   recently received antibiotic therapy (A-II). Broad-spectrum empirical
   therapy is not routinely required but is indicated for severe
   infections, pending culture results and antibiotic susceptibility data
   (B-III). Take into consideration any recent antibiotic therapy and local
   antibiotic susceptibility data, especially the prevalence of
   methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms.
   Definitive therapy should be based on both the culture results and
   susceptibility data and the clinical response to the empirical regimen
   (C-III). 11. There is only limited evidence with which to make informed
   choices among the various topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotic
   agents.
   Vitually all severe and some moderate infections require parenteral
   therapy, at least initially (C-III). Highly bioavailable oral
   antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections,
   including some cases of osteomyelitis (A-II). Topical therapy may be
   used for some mild superficial infections (B-I). 12. Continue antibiotic
   therapy until there is evidence that the infection has resolved but not
   necessarily until a wound has healed. Suggestions for the duration of
   antibiotic therapy are as follows: for mild infections, 12 weeks usually
   suffices, but some require an additional 12 weeks; for moderate and
   severe infections, usually 24 weeks is sufficient, depending on the
   structures involved, the adequacy of debridement, the type of
   soft-tissue wound cover, and wound vascularity (A-II); and for
   osteomyelitis, generally at least 46 weeks is required, but a shorter
   duration is sufficient if the entire infected bone is removed, and
   probably a longer duration is needed if infected bone remains (B-II).
   13. If an infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to I
   antibiotic courses, consider discontinuing all antimicrobials and, after
   a few days, obtaining optimal culture specimens (C-III). 14. Seek
   surgical consultation and, when needed, intervention for infections
   accompanied by a deep abscess, extensive bone or joint involvement,
   crepitus, substantial necrosis or gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis
   (A-II). Evaluating the limb's arterial supply and revascularizing when
   indicated are particularly important. Surgeons with experience and
   interest in the field should be recruited by the foot-care team, if
   possible. 15. Providing optimal wound care, in addition to appropriate
   antibiotic treatment of the infection, is crucial for healing (A-I).
   This includes proper wound cleansing, debridement of any callus and
   necrotic tissue, and, especially, off-loading of pressure. There is
   insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific wound dressing or
   any type of wound healing agents or products for infected foot wounds.
   16. Patients with infected wounds require early and careful follow-up
   observation to ensure that the selected medical and surgical treatment
   regimens have been appropriate and effective (B-III). 17. Studies have
   not adequately defined the role of most adjunctive therapies for
   diabetic foot infections, but systematic reviews suggest that
   granulocyte colony stimulating factors and systemic hyperbaric oxygen
   therapy may help prevent amputations (B-I). These treatments may be
   useful for severe infections or for those that have not adequately
   responded to therapy, despite correcting for all amenable local and
   systemic adverse factors. 18. Spread of infection to bone (osteitis or
   osteomyelitis) may be difficult to distinguish from noninfectious
   osteoarthropathy. Clinical examination and imaging tests may suffice,
   but bone biopsy is valuable for establishing the diagnosis of
   osteomyelitis, for defining the pathogenic organism(s), and for
   determining the antibiotic susceptibilities of such organisms (B-II).
   19. Although this field has matured, further research is much needed.
   The committee especially recommends that adequately powered prospective
   studies be undertaken to elucidate and validate systems for classifying
   infection, diagnosing osteomyelitis, defining optimal antibiotic
   regimens in various situations, and clarifying the role of surgery in
   treating osteomyelitis (A-III).}},

Abstract = {{The in vivo assessment of axonal projections of the peripheral nervous
   system has been severely limited by the lack of noninvasive techniques.
   We examined whether MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking of
   the human median nerve is feasible. The median nerve was examined with a
   3-T MRI scanner in wrists of three healthy volunteers and the wrist of a
   patient after median nerve repair. In vivo three-dimensional (3D)
   reconstruction of axonal projections of the median nerve Could be
   achieved in healthy volunteers with intact median nerves and a patient
   with a transected median nerve using diffusion tensor imaging combined
   with fiber tracking. The median nerve could be Visualized and correlated
   well to the expected location on T1-weighted images in the patient and
   all volunteers. The transected median nerve in the patient could be
   detected Lip to the site of repair one month postoperatively, whereas
   the nerve Could not be detected more distally immediately after repair.
   Two months postoperatively, it could clearly be tracked more distally,
   indicating nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging can detect the
   median nerve in healthy individuals as well as LIP to the lesion site in
   a patient with a complete transection of the median nerve. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{``Pure{''} adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is the noninflammatory
   myeloneuropathic variant of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, where the
   disease process appears to be restricted to spinal cord tracts and
   peripheral nerves. The absence of obvious brain involvement makes it
   distinct from the inflammatory cerebral phenotypes of X-linked
   adrenoleukodystrophy. However, some pure AMN patients later experience
   development of cerebral demyelination, but little is known about the
   extent of brain involvement in pure AMN patients who have normal brain
   magnetic resonance imaging. We used diffusion tensor imaging to
   investigate possible occult cerebral abnormalities in such pure AMN
   patients. Fractional anisotropy and trace were studied in
   three-dimensional reconstructions of white matter tracts commonly
   involved in cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.
   Results demonstrated reduced fractional anisotropy and increased trace
   in bilateral corticospinal tracts and genu of corpus callosum (p <
   0.05). Diffusion tensor imaging-based three-dimensional fiber tracking
   showed occult tract-specific cerebral microstructural abnormalities in
   pure AMN patients who had a normal conventional brain magnetic resonance
   image. Corticospinal tract abnormalities could reflect a centripetal
   extension of spinal cord long-tract distal axonopathy. Accompanying
   abnormalities in genu of corpus callosum indicate that the disease
   pathology in pure AMN may not be limited to spinal cord long tracts
   alone, although the involvement of the latter is most prominent and

Abstract = {{The trigeminal nerve and nuclei (the trigeminal complex) are unique in
   the human body with regard to their anatomical and physiological
   characteristics. They are also special regarding the lesions in which
   they are involved, both at the peripheral level because of the
   susceptibility of some terminal branches, and at the nuclei because of
   their large size and the large amount of connections with other centers.
   Conventional magnetic resonance imaging studies are often not
   sufficiently informative to demonstrate very tiny lesions that could be
   responsible for an important damage in the brainstem. Therefore,
   clinical neurophysiology and specifically, the techniques used in the
   study of the trigeminal functions, remain as convenient diagnostic and
   research tools to document clinically evident lesions or uncover
   subclinical abnormalities. This review is focussed on the clinical
   applicability of the study of trigeminal reflexes, including methods
   employed in the documentation of focal lesions of peripheral branches,

Abstract = {{Objective: We studied whether distal peripheral nerves could be imaged
   using quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a 3-T MRI
   scanner, and visualized using tractography.
   Methods: Altogether 6 healthy subjects were studied. The diffusion was
   quantified with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional
   anisotropy (FA) maps, and the direction of main diffusivity was
   visualized with color-coded orientation maps and tractography.
   Results: We present the first DTI and tractography results of human
   distal peripheral nerves. The courses of median, ulnar, and radial
   nerves in the upper limb and of tibial and peroneal nerves in the lower
   limb were first analyzed quantifying ADC and FA, and then visualized in
   31) with tractography. Tractography illustrated nicely the 3D courses of
   both upper and lower limb nerves which were reliably distinguished from
   the surrounding muscle tissue and ligaments.
   Conclusions: Quantitative DTI and tractography can be used to image and
   visualize distal peripheral nerves. Significance: DTI is a quantitative
   method that could provide useful information for the diagnosis and
   follow-up of nerve lesions, entrapments, and regeneration. Peripheral
   nerves as well-delineated structures also containing abundant branching
   into bundles of different diameters, could be used as `living phantoms'
   for testing and validating different tractography methods. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - To characterize structural changes and the metabolic profile
   of foot muscles and correlate them with diabetic neuropathy measurements
   using phosphorus-31 (P-31) rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement
   (RARE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We studied 12 control subjects, 9
   nonneu-ropathic diabetic patients, and 12 neuropathic diabetic patients
   using P-31 RARE and proton (H-1) MR1 at 3 Tesla. The ratio of the total
   cross-sectional area of the foot to that of the muscle tissue was
   calculated from transaxial H-1 and P-31 images. The average P-31
   concentration across the metatarsal head region was measured from the
   P-31 images.
   RESULTS - The muscle area-to-total area ratio differed among all three
   groups (means +/- SD): 0.55 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.06
   for control, nonneuropathic, and neuropathic subjects, respectively (P <
   0.0001). The average P-31 concentration also differed among all groups:
   27.7 +/- 3.8 vs. 21.7 +/- 4.8 vs. 7.9 +/- 8.8 mmol/l for control,
   nonneuropathic, and neuropathic subjects (P < 0.0001). The muscle
   area-to-total area ratio strongly correlated with clinical measurements:
   Neuropathy Disability Score, r = -0.83, P < 0.0001; vibration perception
   threshold, r = -0.79, P < 0.0001; and Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, r
   -0.87, P < 0.0001.
   CONCLUSIONS - Small muscle atrophy is present in diabetes before
   clinical peripheral neuropathy can be detected using standard clinical
   techniques. The P-31 RARE MRI method evaluates the severity of muscle
   atrophy, even in the early stages when neuropathy is absent. This
   technique may prove to be a useful diagnostic tool in identifying
   early-stage diabetic foot problems.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine the possibility of performing high-resolution MRI
   (microneurography) on peripheral nerves.
   Materials and Methods: A specific radio frequency (RF) coil was
   developed to probe the human median nerve at a magnetic field strength
   of 9.4 T and tested on three excised samples by acquiring
   microneurograms.
   Results: The microneurograms revealed neuronal tissue constituents at
   subfascicular level. The contrast features on proton-density and T1- and
   T2-weighted images were described and compared. The microscopic water
   movement was quantified using diffusion weighting parallel and
   orthogonal to the neuronal fiber orientation. The characteristics of
   anisotropic diffusion in the median nerve were comparable to those
   reported from other biological tissues (white matter and kidney).
   Conclusion: The results overall suggest that microneuroraphy might
   provide new noninvasive insights into microscopic gross anatomy of the
   peripheral nerve, injury evaluation, and efficacy of repair, although
   the feasibility at current clinically relevant field strengths is yet to
   be determined. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review Clinical investigations of peripheral nerve lesions
   routinely involve nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Imaging
   studies are often used to exclude focal mass lesions or external
   compression and to visualize muscle atrophy. More recently, it has been
   recognized that magnetic resonance imaging can identify changes in
   peripheral nerves and secondary neurogenic alterations in skeletal
   muscle, which may significantly enhance its use in the differential
   diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease.
   Recent findings Acute axonal nerve lesions cause a hyperintense signal
   on T2-weighted images at and distal to the lesion site, which correlates
   with Wallerian degeneration and nerve oedema. Superparamagnetic iron
   oxide particles provide an exciting new tool to detect the invasion of
   macrophages into the degenerating nerve distal to an axonal lesion.
   Prolongation of the T2 relaxation time and gadolinium enhancement of
   denervated muscle develop in parallel to the development of spontaneous
   activity on electromyography, and are probably the consequence of
   capillary enlargement and increased muscular blood volume.
   Summary Magnetic resonance imaging supplements the differential
   diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. An advantage over clinical
   neurophysiological investigations is that it is operator independent and
   painless. It can identify axonal damage and may thus help to identify a
   lesion site precisely, where fractionated nerve conduction studies are
   not applicable. Novel contrast media may potentially be used to detect
   pathophysiologically relevant mechanisms such as infiltration of the
   nerve by macrophages. Magnetic resonance imaging also has the advantage
   of providing a lasting detailed topographical picture of regional
   variations and avoids localization errors of muscles in
   electromyography.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. It is widely accepted that peripheral nerve repairs
   performed within 6 weeks of injury have much better outcomes than those
   performed at later dates. However, there is no diagnostic technique that
   can determine if a traumatic peripheral nerve injury requires surgical
   intervention in the early postinjury phase. The objective of this
   article was to determine whether novel, noninvasive magnetic resonance
   imaging techniques could demonstrate the microstructure of human
   peripheral nerves that is necessary for determining prognosis and
   determining if surgery is indicated following traumatic injury. Methods.
   Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging protocols were developed on a 9.4-T
   research scanner using spin-echo proton density and gradient-echo
   imaging sequences and a specially designed, inductively coupled radio
   frequency coil. These imaging protocols were applied to in situ imaging
   of the human median nerve in 4 fresh frozen cadaver arms. Results.
   Noninvasive high-resolution images of the human median nerve were
   obtained. Structures in the nerve that were observed included,
   fascicles, interfascicular epineurium, perineurzum, and intrafascicular
   septations. Conclusion. Application of these imaging techniques to
   clinical scanners could provide physicians with a tool that is capable
   of grading the severity of nerve injuries and providing indications, for
   surgery in the early postinjury phase.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus has a high incidence in general population
   and goes by high morbidity by specific micro vascular pathology in the
   retina, renal glomerul and peripheral nerves. In type 1 DM, intensive
   therapy can prevent or delay the development of long-term complications
   associated with DM but hypoglycaemia especially severe hypoglycaemia
   defined, as a low blood glucose resulting in stupor, seizure, or
   unconsciousness that precludes self-treatment is a serious threat.
   Hypoglycaemia that may preferentially harm neurons in the medial
   temporal region, specifically the hippocampus, is a potential danger for
   the brain cognitive function which several studies failed to detect any
   significant effects, whereas others indicated an influence on it. A
   young diabetic case presented here with severe cognitive defect. Great
   number of severe hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic attacks and convulsion
   episodes were described in his medical history.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Neuroradiologic findings on CT and MRI, pointed
   that global cerebral atrophy that is incompatible with his age. Brain
   perfusion studies (SPELT, Tc-99m-labeled HMPAO) also showed that there
   were severe perfusion defects at superior temporal region and less
   perfusion defects at gyrus cingulim in frontal region. These regions are
   related with memory processing. Severe cognitive defect in this patient
   seems to be closely related these changes and no another reason was
   found to explain except the repeated severe hypoglycaemic episodes.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation therapy is a mainstay of cancer treatment, particularly for
   patients with nervous system tumors. Like most cancer treatments,
   radiation is nonspecifically cytotoxic. As a result, when radiation
   therapy is used to treat primary or metastatic nervous system cancers or
   non-nervous system malignancies located close to neural structures (eg,
   head and neck cancers or mediastinal Hodgkin disease), treatment must be
   carefully crafted and doses and fraction sizes curtailed to prevent
   injury to the adjacent normal nervous system. A dramatic example of
   radiation-related nervous system injury, cerebral radionecrosis, was
   originally described in 1930, soon after radiation was first used
   therapeutically for brain tumors {[}1]. Since that time, a spectrum of
   injuries involving central and peripheral nervous system structures has
   been identified. Despite this heightened awareness, the neurologic
   complications of radiation therapy continue to occur because individual
   tolerances to radiation are variable, safe radiation thresholds are not
   precisely known (and may be altered by concurrent chemotherapy,
   pre-existing disease, and variations in tumor anatomy), and intentional
   ``overdoses{''} may be given with curative or long-term palliative
   intent. The incidence of radiation-related nervous system injury seems
   to be increasing as conventional radiation therapy techniques are being
   applied more aggressively, new approaches (such as hyperfractionated
   radiation therapy, concurrent chemo- and radiotherapy, and radiosurgery)
   are becoming commonplace, and patients are surviving longer. Accurate
   diagnosis based on clinical manifestations is critical to exclude other
   potentially treatable total doses, higher fraction size, and larger
   volumes of treated nervous system {[}2].
   Among the acute complications, acute radiation encephalopathy is now
   uncommon because of careful radiation treatment planning and the
   judicious use of corticosteroids.
   In contrast, fatigue and other nonspecific side effects associated with
   conventional and stereotactic cranial irradiation (Box 1) occur in the
   majority of patients. Except for subacute myelopathy, which is seen in
   up to 15\% of patients treated with mantle irradiation for Hodgkin
   disease, the subacute complications of nervous system irradiation are
   also uncommon. In contrast to the acute and subacute complications of
   radiation, late radiation effects are relatively common. Delayed
   cerebral radionecrosis occurs in approximately 5\% of patients receiving
   more than 5000 cGy of cranial irradiation, although the actual incidence
   is dose and fraction size dependent (Fig. 1A, B; Fig. 2A, B).
   Hypertension, diabetes, concomitant chemotherapy (particularly with
   known radiosensitizing agents) {[}3-7], accelerated hyperfractionated
   radiation {[}8], stereotactic radiosurgery, and interstitial
   brachytherapy increase the frequency and accelerate the time course of
   this form of late-radiation-related injury. Up to 20\% of patients
   receiving stereotactic radiosurgery {[}9] and as many as 80\% of
   patients undergoing interstitial brachytherapy develop symptomatic
   radionecrosis, usually 3 to 12 months after treatment {[}10].
   Radiation-related white matter changes are extremely common on CT and
   MRI scans {[}11,12], and as many as 20\% of patients with these
   radiographic correlates of diffuse late brain injury develop frank
   radiation-induced dementia {[} 13] (Fig. 3A-D). The incidence is
   greatest in patients receiving whole-brain radiation therapy with
   fractions greater than 200 cGy and in patients surviving more than I
   year. Concurrent methotrexate or nitrosourea chemotherapy may increase
   the risk. Subtle, nonprogressive personality and cognitive changes are
   even more frequent and are more pronounced in children and in those over
   60 years of age.
   The manifestations of radiation-induced endocrine dysfunction are often
   subtle and difficult to distinguish from other treatment- and
   tumor-related with regard to prognosis and therapeutic options, and
   competing diagnoses with very different natural histories and therapies
   often mask or mimic the signs and symptoms of radiation-related nervous
   system injury. The ability to efficiently negotiate this complicated
   differential diagnostic landscape allows for early diagnosis of tumor
   recurrence or an alternative etiology, prompt institution of appropriate
   therapy, avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic studies, and confident
   prognostication for patients and families. Even after the diagnosis of a
   radiation-related complication is made, continued vigilance for
   additional sites or manifestations of radiation injury is mandatory.
   Meanwhile, further research into treatment, prevention, and the causes
   of individual susceptibility to radiation injury are essential.}},

Abstract = {{X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a hereditary
   demyelinating neuropathy caused by mutations in the connexin 32 (Cx32)
   gene. Cx32 is widely expressed in brain and peripheral nerve, yet
   clinical manifestations of CMTX mainly arise from peripheral neuropathy.
   We have evaluated two male patients with CMTX who on separate occasions
   developed transient ataxia, dysarthria, and weakness within 3 days of
   returning from ski trips at altitudes above 8,000 feet. Magnetic
   resonance imaging studies in both patients showed nonenhancing,
   confluent, and symmetrical white matter abnormalities that were more
   pronounced posteriorly and that resolved over several months. Magnetic
   transfer images in one patient demonstrated increased magnetization
   transfer ratios distinct from that seen in demyelination or edema. Both
   patients returned to their normal baseline within 2 to 3 weeks. These
   cases suggest that CMTX patients are at risk for developing an acute,
   transient, neurological syndrome when they travel to places at high
   altitudes and return to sea level. Cx32 mutations may cause central
   nervous system dysfunction by reducing the number of functioning gap
   junctions between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, making both cells
   more susceptible to abnormalities of intercellular exchange of ions and
   small molecules in situations of metabolic stress.}},

Abstract = {{Alpha-mannosidosis is a disease caused by the deficient activity of
   alpha-mannosidase, a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the degradation of
   glycoproteins. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of
   mannose-rich oligosaccharides within lysosomes. The purpose of this
   study was to characterize the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and
   central nervous system (CNS) myelin abnormalities in cats from a
   breeding colony with a uniform mutation in the gene encoding
   alpha-mannosidase. Three affected cats and 3 normal cats from 2 litters
   were examined weekly from 4 to 18 wk of age. Progressively worsening
   neurological signs developed in affected cats that included tremors,
   loss of balance. and nystagmus. In the PNS, affected cats showed slow
   motor nerve conduction velocity and increased F-wave latency. Single
   nerve fiber teasing revealed significant demyelination/remyelination in
   affected cats. Mean G-ratios of nerves showed a significant increase in
   affected cats compared to normal cats. Magnetic resonance imaging of the
   CNS revealed diffuse white matter signal abnormalities throughout the
   brain of affected cats. Quantitative magnetization transfer imaging
   showed a 8\%-16\%, decrease in the magnetization transfer ratio in brain
   white matter of affected cats compared to normal cats. consistent with
   myelin abnormalities. Histology confirmed myelin loss throughout the
   cerebrum and cerebellum. Thus, histology, electrodiagnostic testing, and
   magnetic resonance imaging identified significant myelination
   abnormalities in both the PNS and CNS that have not been described
   previously in alpha-mannosidosis.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance techniques have become increasingly important in
   neurology for defining:
   1 brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerve or muscle structure,
   2 pathological changes in tissue structures and properties: and
   3 dynamic patterns of functional activation of the brain.
   New applications have been driven in part by advances in hardware,
   particularly improvements in magnet and gradient coil design. Neu:
   imaging strategies allow novel approaches to contrast with, for example,
   diffusion imaging, magnetization transfer imaging. perfusion imaging and
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging. In parallel with developments in
   hardware and image acquisition have been new approaches to image
   analysis. These have allowed quantitative descriptions of the image
   changes to be used for a precise, non-invasive definition of pathology.
   With the increasing capabilities and specificity of magnetic resonance
   techniques it is becoming more important that the neurologist is
   intimately involved in both the selection of magnetic resonance studies
   for patients and their interpretation. There is a need for considerably
   improved access to magnetic resonance technology, particularly in the

Abstract = {{Background: The frequency of the association between chronic
   demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) and central nervous
   system (CNS) demyelinating lesions is probably underestimated.
   Objective: To investigate the occurrence of combined central and
   peripheral demyelination in CIDP patients and to correlate visual evoked
   potential (VEP) abnormalities with CNS demyelinating lesions, observed
   on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and antibodies against glycolipids.
   Methods: Nerve conduction studies, brain MRI and antibodies against
   glycolipids were prospectively studied in 17 patients who fulfilled the
   diagnostic criteria proposed for CIDP (Cornblath DR, Asbury AK, Albers
   JW, Feasby TE, Hahn AF, McLeod JG, Mendell JR, Parry GJ, Pollard JD,
   Thomas PK. Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology AIDS
   Task Force. Research criteria for diagnosis of chronic inflammatory
   demyelinating polyneuropathy. Neurology, 1991;41:617-618). VEPs were
   performed in each case before and after 6 months treatment with either
   intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or steroids.
   Results: Eight patients (47\%) had increased latencies in at least one
   eye or showed increased interocular latency difference. Four patients
   (23\%) presented a significant high signal intensity on T2-weighted
   brain MRI images. Of these 4 patients, 3 had prolonged VEP latency. Two
   patients with delayed VEP latency had antibodies against GM1, and SGLPG
   and anti-sulfatides, respectively. One patient with normal VEPs also had
   antibodies to GM1. VEP results were not significantly modified after
   treatment, either with steroids or IVIG.
   Conclusion: This study confirmed the high frequency of abnormal VEPs in
   CIDP patients, and found that they are poorly correlated with CNS
   demyelinating lesions and antibodies against glycolipids. The VEP
   abnormalities of these patients may be explained by the susceptibility
   to immune-mediated damage of both the peripheral nervous system and the
   optic nerve. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To analyze peripheral nerves with ultrasonography (US) and
   magnetic resonance imaging (MR) in leprosy and assess the role of
   imaging in leprosy patients. Design arm patients. Fifty-eight nerves
   with abnormal clinical features or electromyograms were examined in 23
   leprosy patients by means of gray-scale US, Doppler US and MR imaging.
   Image analysis included: measurement of nerve cross-sectional area;
   assessment of nerve structure and MR signal intensities; identification
   of nerve compression within osteofibrous tunnels; detection of
   endoneural color flow signals and Gd-DTPA enhancement. Correlations were
   made with clinical findings and a control group of 20 subjects. Fourteen
   nerves in active reversal reaction were followed up after therapy.
   Results. Leprosy nerves were classified into three groups based on
   imaging appearance: group I consisted of 17 normal-appearing nerves;
   group II, of 30 enlarged nerves with fascicular abnormalities; group
   III, of 11 nerves with absent fascicular structure. Group II nerves were
   from patients subjected to reversal reactions, 75\% of patients with
   group III nerves had a history of erythema nodosum leprosum. Nerve
   compression in osteofibrous tunnels was identified in 33\% of group II
   and 18\% of group III nerves. Doppler US and MR imaging were 74\% and
   92\% sensitive in identifying active reactions, based on detection of
   endoneural color flow signals, long T2 and Gd enhancement. In 64\% of
   cases, follow-up studies showed decreased color flow and Gd uptake after
   steroids and decompressive surgery.
   Conclusion. US and MR imaging are able to detect nerves abnormalities in
   leprosy. Active reversal reactions are indicated by endoneural color
   flow signals as well as by an increased T2 signal and Gd enhancement.
   These signs would suggest rapid progression of nerve damage and a poor
   prognosis unless antireactional treatment is started.}},

Abstract = {{Background Ataxia is the commonest neurological manifestation of coeliac
   disease. Some individuals with genetic susceptibility to the disease
   have serological evidence of gluten sensitivity without overt
   gastrointestinal symptoms or evidence of small-bower inflammation. The
   sole manifestation of disease in such patients may be ataxia. We
   describe the clinical, radiological, and neurophysiological features of
   this disorder.
   Methods Patients with ataxia attending the neurology outpatient clinics
   at the royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK, were screened for
   gluten sensitivity as shown by the titre of antibody to gliadin. Those
   with other causes of ataxia were excluded. we carried out clinical,
   neurophysiological, neuroradiological, and, in two cases,
   neuropathological examinations.
   Findings 28 patients with gluten ataxia were identified. All had gait
   ataxia and most had limb ataxia. Those with more severe gait ataxia had
   longer disease duration. No patient had tremor or other extrapyramidal
   features. 19 patients showed some form of peripheral neuropathy on
   neurophysiological examination. 16 patients had no gastrointestinal
   symptoms. Distal duodenal biopsy showed lymphocytic infiltration in two
   patients, and changes compatible with coeliac disease in 11. Six
   patients had evidence of cerebellar atrophy on magnetic-resonance
   imaging. Necropsy was done on two patients who died; there was
   lymphocytic infiltration of the cerebellum, damage to the posterior
   columns of the spinal cord, and sparse infiltration of the peripheral
   nerves.
   Interpretation Gluten sensitivity is an important cause of apparently
   idiopathic ataxia and may be progressive. The ataxia is a result of
   immunological damage to the cerebellum, to the posterior columns of the
   spinal cord, and to peripheral nerves. We propose the term gluten ataxia
   to describe this disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the potential of
   MR imaging to depict morphologic alterations of the median nerve
   correlating with the stage of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Eighteen
   wrists of normal subjects and 81 wrists of patients with CTS were
   examined, MR imaging was performed with proton-density- and T2-weighted
   spin-echo sequences, Staging of CTS was done on the basis of clinical
   and electrophysiological testing, including evaluation of the number of
   previous steroid infiltrations in conservative treatment. Median nerve
   fattening, cross-sectional area, and signal intensity were measured from
   the distal radius to the end of the carpal tunnel, Delineation and
   structure of the median nerve were recorded qualitatively by two
   experienced radiologists in consensus. Three major MR imaging criteria
   of early CTS were (a) isolated prestenotic and intracarpal swelling of
   the median nerve (P < .01), (b) the absence of significant flattening,
   and (c) a generalized increase in signal intensity retrograde to the
   distal radius (P < .01), The nerve showed sharply delineated contours
   and a homogeneous signal pattern. Advanced CTS was characterized by
   retrograde swelling of the median nerve to the distal radius (P < .01)
   and decreased signal intensity (P < .05). Demarcation of the nerve
   became poorer, and its signal pattern appeared fasciculated, After
   steroid infiltration, the median nerve was difficult to delineate,
   showed an inhomogeneous structure, and swelling was less pronounced than
   without steroid infiltration (P < .05), MR imaging yields typical
   morphologic findings that correlate with the duration and severity of
   median nerve compression. Hence, MR imaging allows staging of median
   nerve compression in CTS and thus may contribute to therapeutic
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{THE FORCE AND fatigue of the wrist extensor muscles during maximal
   voluntary and tetanic contractions were measured and compared in the
   injured and noninjured extremities of 11 patients with radial nerve gap
   injury and in 9 normal volunteers. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the
   wrist extensor muscles was determined by magnetic resonance imaging and
   was correlated with force. In the patient group, an average of three
   (range, 2-4) sural nerve cable grafts, measuring 11.5 +/- 5 cm (range,
   5-20 cm) in length, were sutured to the nerve stumps at least 9 years
   before this study. Differences in the CSA values of the injured and
   noninjured arms were compared, and a ratio was established (CSA(R)). The
   mean CSA(R) was 82.9\% +/- 14.3. These differences were not
   statistically significant (P > 0.10, paired t-test). Despite very
   well-recovered muscular mass, the maximal voluntary contraction force
   was found to be incompletely recovered by up to 62.7\% +/- 23, when
   compared with the noninjured side (P < 0.05, paired t-test). The
   fraction maximal voluntary contraction force/CSA had decreased by up to
   76.4\% +/- 25.5 (P < 0.05, paired t-test). An increased fatigability of
   the affected muscles persisted in all patients. The patients' noninjured
   extremity behaved in the same way as that of the dominant extremity of
   normal volunteers with regard to force, lever, and CSA values. In the
   best-recovered patients, the relation of the maximal voluntary
   contraction force between the noninjured and the injured side was the
   same (90\% +/- 9.9) as that found between the dominant and the
   nondominant extremity of normal volunteers (P < 0.05, paired t-test). In
   more than half of the patients, sural nerve cables provided adequate
   reinnervation of the wrist extensor muscles to enable them to recover
   and even to exceed the bottom 5\% contraction force (139 N) reported by
   other authors for the normal male population. Several anatomical
   features of the radial nerve, however, also participated in a favorable
   outcome of the motor function after autografting of this nerve.}},

   In all cases T2 relaxation time, signal intensity on T1-weighted images
   (lesion/muscle ratio), detectability of nerve of origin, nerve-lesion

   showed marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted images with T2 relaxation
   times values > 95 ms.  One schwannoma was almost isointense with fat (T2
   60 ms).  All lesions were isointense with muscle on T1-weighted images. 
   In schwannomas the nerve was usually situated at the periphery of the

   In patients with soft tissue masses, MR may contribute to recognition of

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate 22 histologically
   proven peripheral nerve sheath tumors approximately two-thirds of which
   arose in the lower extremity.  The histologic distribution was as
   follows:  12 schwannomas, 7 neurofibromas, and 3 malignant peripheral
   nerve sheath tumors (2 of which occurred in patients with
   neurofibromatosis).  Most lesions demonstrated an intermediate to
   moderately bright signal on T1-weighted images and were minimally
   inhomogeneous.  All lesions were moderately bright on
   proton-density-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images, again
   with variable inhomogeneity.  The extent of the tumor was best assessed
   on proton-density- and T2-weighted images.  Smooth margins were noted in
   19 lesions.  Of the 3 remaining lesions, 2 were malignant (but had been
   subjected to biopsy prior to MRI), and the other lesion was a plexiform
   neurofibroma.  MRI accurately determined the relationship between the
   lesion and the adjacent neurovascular structures and muscles, thereby
