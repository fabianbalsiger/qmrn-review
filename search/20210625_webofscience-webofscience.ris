N2  - Aims/hypothesis: In addition to nephropathy, retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy, a microvascular complication of type 1 diabetes that may be tentatively referred to as 'diabetic encephalopathy' has gained increasing attention. There is growing evidence that lowered cognitive performance in patients with type 1 diabetes is related to chronic hyperglycaemia rather than recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, as previously speculated. The aim of our study was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to establish whether long-term hyperglycaemia, resulting in advanced retinopathy, contributes to structural changes in the brain (reduced grey matter). Subjects, materials and methods: We applied voxel-based morphometry on magnetic resonance images to compare grey matter density (GMD) between three groups of participants. GMD is used as a marker of cortical atrophy. We compared 13 type 1 diabetic patients with a microvascular complication (i.e. proliferative retinopathy) with 18 type 1 diabetic patients who did not have retinopathy in order to assess the effects of microvascular changes on GMD. Both patient groups were compared with 21 healthy control subjects to assess the effect of diabetes in itself. Results: Patients with diabetic retinopathy showed reduced GMD in the right inferior frontal gyrus and right occipital lobe compared both with patients without retinopathy and with healthy controls (p<0.05). Conclusions/interpretation: Our data show that patients with type 1 diabetes, who, as a consequence of chronic hyperglycaemia, had developed advanced retinopathy, also showed increased focal cortical atrophy on brain MRI. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

N2  - Objectives: Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are complex, histologically benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that are challenging to measure by simple line measurements. Computer-aided volumetric segmentation of PN has become the recommended method to assess response in clinical trials directed at PN. Different methods for volumetric analysis of PN have been developed. The goal of this study is to test the level of agreement in volume measurements and in interval changes using two separate methods of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Methods: Three independent volume measurements were performed on 15 PN imaged at three time-points using 3DQI software at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) and MEDx software at NCI. Results: Median volume differences at each time-point comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were −0.5, −4.2, and −19.9 mL; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −21.0, −47.0, and −21.0 mL; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −10.0, −70.3, and −29.9 mL. Median differences in percentage change over time comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were −1.7, 1.1, and −1.0%; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −2.3, 3.3, and −1.1%; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −0.4, 2.0, and −1.5%. Volume differences were <20% of the mean of the two measurements in 117 of 135 comparisons (86.7%). Difference in interval change was <20% in 120 of the 135 comparisons (88.9%), while disease status classification was concordant in 115 of 135 comparisons (85.2%). Conclusions: The volumes, interval changes, and progression status classifications were in good agreement. The comparison of two volumetric analysis methods suggests no systematic differences in tumor assessment. A prospective comparison of the two methods is planned. © 2018

N2  - Background: In addition to fiber tracking, stereoscopic display of the peripheral nerves can be obtained based on magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using post-processing methods, including volume rendering (VR) and maximum intensity projection (MIP). However, sufficient suppression of the image noise remains a challenge. Objectives: To achieve three-dimensional (3D) display of the peripheral nerves in the wrist region using two post-processing methods for DTI, i.e. VR reconstruction for single-direction images and the subtraction of unidirectionally encoded images for suppression of heavily isotropic objects (SUSHI); to compare the quality of images obtained via the two approaches; and to explore their clinical applications. Materials and Methods: We performed DTI scans using 6 (DTI6) and 25 (DTI25) encoding diffusion directions for 20 wrists of 10 healthy adult volunteers. We used VR to reconstruct 2 types of images: 1, single-direction (anterior-posterior [AP] direction) and 2, SUSHI (AP direction with the subtraction of the superior-inferior [SI] direction). The 3D nerve image quality, noise level, and degree of noise-removal difficulty were evaluated according to custom evaluation scales. The preliminary clinical applications of these methods were explored through follow-ups with patients with nerve laceration in the wrist region. Results: Single-direction VR reconstruction clearly showed the nerves for both DTI6 and DTI25 but with obvious noise. In DTI25, VR reconstruction for SUSHI showed the nerves clearly with excellent nerve signal intensity. In DTI6, SUSHI post-processing lost some ulnar nerve signal intensity, resulting in a significant difference in image quality scores between single-direction images and SUSHI. Most of the noise was removed after SUSHI post-processing. Conclusion: VR reconstruction for both single-direction images and SUSHI using DTI25 raw data provides excellent 3D displays of the peripheral nerves in the wrist region. SUSHI post-processing is a useful denoising tool because it automatically reduces the majority of isotropic object noise. © 2016, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Iranian Society of Radiology.

N2  - A 25-year-old man developed a growing neck mass, and percutaneous biopsy yielded diagnosis of schwannoma. The patient underwent magnetic resonance (MR) neurography, including diffusion tensor imaging performed with RESOLVE at 3 tesla (Skyra; Siemens, Malvern, PA). Postprocessing and 3-dimensional tractography were performed in DSI studio (dsi-studio.labsolver.org). 1 MR neurography confirmed a mass arising from the right C4 nerve (figure, A). Tractography localized a potential window for surgical approach in the surrounding nerve fibers (figure, B and C). Intraoperative electrophysiologic mapping and microscopy findings (figure, D-F) precisely confirmed the imaging findings. Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography may be valuable in the preoperative workup of peripheral nerve tumors. 2,3Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - We applied diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), a recently developed MRI technique that reveals the microstructures of tissues based on its ability to monitor the random movements of water molecules, to the visualization of peripheral nerves after injury. The rat sciatic nerve was subjected to contusive injury, and the data obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to determine the tracks of nerve fibers (DTT). The DTT images obtained using the fractional anisotropy (FA) threshold value of 0.4 clearly revealed the recovery process of the contused nerves. Immediately after the injury, fiber tracking from the designated proximal site could not be continued beyond the lesion epicenter, but the intensity improved thereafter, returning to its pre-injury level by 3??weeks later. We compared the FA value, a parameter computed from the DTT data, with the results of histological and functional examinations of the injured nerves, during recovery. The FA values of the peripheral nerves were more strongly correlated with axon-related (axon density and diameter) than with myelin-related (myelin density and thickness) parameters, supporting the theories that axonal membranes play a major role in anisotropic water diffusion and that myelination can modulate the degree of anisotropy. Moreover, restoration of the FA value at the lesion epicenter was strongly correlated with parameters of motor and sensory functional recovery. These correlations of the FA values with both the histological and functional changes demonstrate the potential usefulness of DTT for evaluating clinical events associated with Wallerian degeneration and the regeneration of peripheral nerves. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECT The majority of growing and/or symptomatic peripheral nerve tumors are schwannomas and neurofibromas. They are almost always benign and can usually be resected while minimizing motor and sensory deficits if approached with the proper expertise and techniques. Intraoperative electrophysiological stimulation and recording techniques allow the surgeon to map the surface of the tumor in an effort to identify and thus avoid damaging functioning nerve fibers. Recently, MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques have permitted the visualization of axons, because of their anisotropic properties, in peripheral nerves. The object of this study was to compare the distribution of nerve fibers as revealed by direct electrical stimulation with that seen on preoperative MR DTI. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with a peripheral nerve or nerve root tumor between March 2012 and January 2014. Diffusion tensor imaging and intraoperative data had been prospectively collected for patients with peripheral nerve tumors that were resected. Preoperative identification of the nerve fiber location in relation to the nerve tumor surface as seen on DTI studies was compared with the nerve fiber's intraoperative localization using electrophysiological stimulation and recordings. RESULTS In 23 patients eligible for study there was good correlation between nerve fiber location on DTI and its anatomical location seen intraoperatively. Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrated the relationship of nerve fibers relative to the tumor with 95.7% sensitivity, 66.7% specificity, 75% positive predictive value, and 93.8% negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative DTI techniques are useful in helping the peripheral nerve surgeon to both determine the risks involved in resecting a nerve tumor and plan the safest surgical approach.

N2  - Purpose: To report a technique developed for visualizing cervical nerve roots and distal nerve fibers using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging employing parallel imaging. Material and Methods: We performed maximum intensity projection for a stack of isotropic axial diffusion-weighted images obtained with parallel imaging applying a motion-probing gradient in six directions with a b -value of 500s/mm 2 in a preliminary series of 13 subjects. Results: This method worked well for visualizing the spinal cord and most of the nerve roots, the dorsal root ganglia, and proximal peripheral nerves. Conclusion: Although the technique remains limited in depicting the brachial plexus and distal nerves, the ability to visualize the proximal peripheral nervous system at the cervical level is promising. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of the association between chronic demyelinating  inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP) and central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating lesions is probably underestimated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of combined central and peripheral demyelination in CIDP patients and to correlate visual evoked potential (VEP) abnormalities with CNS demyelinating lesions, observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and antibodies against glycolipids. METHODS: Nerve conduction studies, brain MRI and antibodies against glycolipids were prospectively studied in 17 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria proposed for CIDP (Cornblath DR, Asbury AK, Albers JW, Feasby TE, Hahn AF, McLeod JG, Mendell JR, Parry GJ, Pollard JD, Thomas PK. Ad Hoc Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task Force. Research criteria for diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Neurology, 1991;41:617-618). VEPs were performed in each case before and after 6 months treatment with either intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or steroids. RESULTS: Eight patients (47%) had increased latencies in at least one eye or showed increased interocular latency difference. Four patients (23%) presented a significant high signal intensity on T2-weighted brain MRI images. Of these 4 patients, 3 had prolonged VEP latency. Two patients with delayed VEP latency had antibodies against GM1, and SGLPG and anti-sulfatides, respectively. One patient with normal VEPs also had antibodies to GM1. VEP results were not significantly modified after treatment, either with steroids or IVIG. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the high frequency of abnormal VEPs in CIDP patients, and found that they are poorly correlated with CNS demyelinating lesions and antibodies against glycolipids. The VEP abnormalities of these patients may be explained by the susceptibility to immune-mediated damage of both the peripheral nervous system and the optic nerve.

N2  - Background. The safe performance of regional anaesthesia (RA) requires theoretical knowledge and good manual skills. Virtual reality (VR)-based simulators may offer trainees a safe environment to learn and practice different techniques. However, currently available VR simulators do not consider individual anatomy, which limits their use for realistic training. We have developed a VR-based simulator that can be used for individual anatomy and for different anatomical regions. Methods. Individual data were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) without contrast agent to represent morphology and the vascular system, respectively. For data handling, registration, and segmentation, an application based on the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit was developed. Suitable segmentation algorithms such as the fuzzy c-means clustering approach were integrated, and a hierarchical tree data structure was created to model the flexible anatomical structures of peripheral nerve cords. The simulator was implemented in the VR toolkit ViSTA using modules for collision detection, virtual humanoids, interaction, and visualization. A novel algorithm for electric impulse transmission is the core of the simulation. Results. In a feasibility study, MRI morphology and MRA were acquired from five subjects for the inguinal region. From these sources, three-dimensional anatomical data sets were created and nerves modelled. The resolution obtained from both MRI and MRA was sufficient for realistic simulations. Our high-fidelity simulator application allows trainees to perform virtual peripheral nerve blocks based on these data sets and models. Conclusions. Subject-specific training of RA is supported in a virtual environment. We have adapted segmentation algorithms and developed a VR-based simulator for the inguinal region for use in training for different peripheral nerve blocks. In contrast to available VR-based simulators, our simulation offers anatomical variety.

N2  - Background: After successful utilization of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting brain pathologies, it is now being examined for use in the detection of peripheral neuropathies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic potentials of DTI in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Material/Methods: The literature search was performed in multiple electronic databases using a keyword search and final selection of the studies was based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We performed a meta-analyses of mean differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) between CTS patient and healthy subjects. Publication bias detection was done with Begg’s test and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the source/s of higher heterogeneity and the authenticity of results. Results: FA was significantly lower in CTS patients in comparison with healthy subjects (mean and the difference [95% confidence interval] was –0.06 [–0.10, –0.02] (p=0.003). The ADC was significantly higher in CTS patients (mean difference [95% CI] was 0.10 [0.02, 0.18], p=0.02). Overall sensitivity of FA-based diagnosis was 82.82%, with 77.83% specificity. Conclusions: DTI can be a valuable tool in diagnosing CTS. © Med Sci Monit, 2016.

N2  - Peripheral nerve disorders may be classified into compressive or entrapment neuropathies and non-compressive neuropathies. Muscle denervation recognized on MRI may be a useful sign in the diagnosis of peripheral nerve disorders. Acute or subacute denervation results in prolonged T2 relaxation time, producing increased signal in skeletal muscle on short tau inversion-recovery and fat-suppressed T2-weighted images. Chronic denervation produces fatty atrophy of skeletal muscles, resulting in increased muscle signal on T1-weighted images. This review will outline and illustrate the various ways that muscle denervation as seen on MRI may assist in the diagnosis and localization of peripheral nerve disorders. © 2007 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.

N2  - The group of Multiplied, Added, Subtracted and/or fiTted Inversion Recovery (MASTIR) pulse sequences in which usually two or more inversion recovery (IR) images of different types are combined is described, and uses for this type of sequence are outlined. IR sequences of different types can be multiplied, added, subtracted, and/or fitted together to produce variants of the MASTIR sequence. The sequences provide a range of options for increasing image contrast, demonstrating specific tissues and fluids of interest, and suppressing unwanted signals. A formalism using the concept of pulse sequences as tissue property filters is used to explain the signal, contrast and weighting of the pulse sequences with both univariate and multivariate filter models. Subtraction of one magnitude reconstructed IR image from another with a shorter TI can produce very high T1 dependent positive contrast from small increases in T1. The reverse subtracted IR sequence can provide high positive contrast enhancement with gadolinium chelates and iron deposition which decrease T1. Additional contrast to that arising from increases in T1 can be produced by supplementing this with contrast arising from concurrent increases in ρm and T2, as well as increases or decreases in diffusion using subtraction IR with echo subtraction and/or diffusion subtraction. Phase images may show 180ºdifferences as a result of rotating into the transverse plane both positive and negative longitudinal magnetization. Phase images with contrast arising in this way, or other ways, can be multiplied by magnitude IR images to increase the contrast of the latter. Magnetization Transfer (MT) and susceptibility can be used with IR sequences to improve contrast. Selective images of white and brown adipose tissue lipid and water components can be produced using different TIs and in and out-of-phase TEs. Selective images of ultrashort and short T2 tissue components can be produced by nulling long T2 tissue components with an inversion pulse and subtraction of images with longer TEs from images with ultrashort TEs. The Double Echo Sliding IR (DESIRE) sequence provides images with a wide range of TIs from which it is possible to choose values of TI to achieve particular types of tissue and/or fluid contrast (e.g., for subtraction with different TIs, as described above, and for long T2 tissue signal nulling with UTE sequences). Unwanted tissue and fluid signals can be suppressed by addition and subtraction of phase-sensitive (ps) and magnitude reconstructed images. The sequence also offers options for synergistic use of the changes in blood and tissue ρm, T1, T2/T2*, D* and perfusion that can be seen with fMRI of the brain. In-vivo and ex-vivo illustrative examples of normal brain, cartilage, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and peripheral nerve imaged with different forms of the MASTIR sequence are included. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

N2  - Objective. To analyze peripheral nerves with ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR) in leprosy and assess the role of imaging in leprosy patients. Design and patients. Fifty-eight nerves with abnormal clinical features or electromyograms were examined in 23 leprosy patients by means of gray-scale US, Doppler US and MR imaging. Image analysis included: measurement of nerve cross-sectional area; assessment of nerve structure and MR signal intensities; identification of nerve compression within osteofibrous tunnels; detection of endoneural color flow signals and Gd-DTPA enhancement. Correlations were made with clinical findings and a control group of 20 subjects. Fourteen nerves in active reversal reaction were followed up after therapy. Results. Leprosy nerves were classified into three groups based on imaging appearance: group I consisted of 17 normal-appearing nerves; group II, of 30 enlarged nerves with fascicular abnormalities; group III, of 11 nerves with absent fascicular structure. Group II nerves were from patients subjected to reversal reactions; 75% of patients with group III nerves had a history of erythema nodosum leprosum. Nerve compression in osteofibrous tunnels was identified in 33% of group II and 18% of group III nerves. Doppler US and MR imaging were 74% and 92% sensitive in identifying active reactions, based on detection of endoneural color flow signals, long T2 and Gd enhancement. In 64% of cases, follow-up studies showed decreased color flow and Gd uptake after steroids and decompressive surgery. Conclusions. US and MR imaging are able to detect nerves abnormalities in leprosy. Active reversal reactions are indicated by endoneural color flow signals as well as by an increased T2 signal and Gd enhancement. These signs would suggest rapid progression of nerve damage and a poor prognosis unless antireactional treatment is started.

N2  - Purpose of reviewSingle-organ vasculitis of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is often designated nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN). Several variants or subtypes have been distinguished, including migratory sensory neuropathy, postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy, diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies, skin-nerve vasculitides, and, arguably, neuralgic amyotrophy. NSVN often presents as nondiabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (LRPN). This review updates classification, clinical features, epidemiology, and imaging of these disorders.Recent findingsA recent study showed the annual incidence of LRPN in Olmstead County, Minnesota to be 4.16/100000:2.79/100000 diabetic and 1.27/100000 nondiabetic. This study was the first to determine the incidence or prevalence of any vasculitic neuropathy. In NSVN, ultrasonography shows multifocal enlargement of proximal and distal nerves. In neuralgic amyotrophy, MRI and ultrasound reveal multifocal enlargements and focal constrictions in nerves derived from the brachial plexus. Histopathology of these chronic lesions shows inflammation and rare vasculitis. Diffusion tensor imaging of tibial nerves in NSVN revealed decreased fractional anisotropy in one study.SummarySingle-organ PNS vasculitides are the most common inflammatory neuropathies. Neuralgic amyotrophy might result from PNS vasculitis, but further study is necessary. The usefulness of focal nerve enlargements or constrictions in understanding pathological mechanisms, directing biopsies, and monitoring disease activity in NSVN should be further investigated.Copyright © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Objective The neurofibromatoses (NF) type 1 and 2 are hereditary tumor predisposition syndromes caused by germline mutations in the NF1 and NF2 tumor suppressor genes. In NF1 and 2, peripheral nerve tumors occur regularly. For further characterizing nerve ultrasound was performed in patients with NF1 and 2. Methods Patients with established diagnosis of NF1 (n = 27) and NF2 (n = 10) were included. Ultrasound of peripheral nerves and cervical roots was performed during routine follow-up visits. Healthy volunteers were studied for comparison. Results In patients with NF1, median cross-sectional area (CSA) of most nerves was significantly increased compared to controls and to NF2 due to generalized plexiform tumors, which arose out of multiple fascicles in 23 of 27 patients (85%). These were often accompanied by cutaneous or subcutaneous neurofibromas. In NF2, the overall aspect of peripheral nerves consisted of localized schwannomas (80%) and, apart from that, normal nerve segments. Conclusion Nerve ultrasound is able to visualize different nerve pathologies in NF1 and NF2. It is a precise and inexpensive screening method for peripheral nerve manifestation in neurofibromatosis and should be considered as the first choice screening imaging modality for all peripheral nerves within reach of non-invasive ultrasound techniques. Significance Ultrasound patterns of peripheral nerve pathologies are described for the first time in a large cohort of patients with NF1 and NF2. It is a suitable screening tool and enables targeted MRI analysis.Copyright © 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology

N2  - High-resolution ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the two imaging methods of choice for the study of peripheral nerves. The many advances that have been made in recent years, either by US or MR imaging, including diffusion tensor imaging and tractography, offer new perspectives for the assessment of many pathological processes affecting peripheral nerves such as entrapment syndromes, tumors and tumor-like lesions, and traumatic disorders. Most of these improvements have especially increased the spatial resolution of nerve imaging. US and MR imaging are complementary, each having advantages and disadvantages. Tractography is still emerging in the musculoskeletal field, particularly for the analysis of peripheral nerves, but this technique seems promising. © Thieme Medical Publishers.

N2  - Objective The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of Ultra-high field [UHF] 7 Tesla [T] MRI as compared to 3T MRI in non-contrast enhanced [nCE] imaging of structural anatomy in the elbow, forearm, and hand [upper extremity]. Materials and method A wide range of sequences including T1 weighted [T1] volumetric interpolate breath-hold exam [VIBE], T2 weighted [T2] double-echo steady state [DESS], susceptibility weighted imaging [SWI], time-of-flight [TOF], diffusion tensor imaging [DTI], and diffusion spectrum imaging [DSI] were optimized and incorporated with a radiofrequency [RF] coil system composed of a transverse electromagnetic [TEM] transmit coil combined with an 8-channel receive-only array for 7T upper extremity [UE] imaging. In addition, Siemens optimized protocol/sequences were used on a 3T scanner and the resulting images from T1 VIBE and T2 DESS were compared to that obtained at 7T qualitatively and quantitatively [SWI was only qualitatively compared]. DSI studio was utilized to identify nerves based on analysis of diffusion weighted derived fractional anisotropy images. Images of forearm vasculature were extracted using a paint grow manual segmentation method based on MIPAV [Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization]. Results High resolution and high quality signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]-images of the hand, forearm, and elbow were acquired with nearly homogeneous 7T excitation. Measured [performed on the T1 VIBE and T2 DESS sequences] SNR and CNR values were almost doubled at 7T vs. 3T. Cartilage, synovial fluid and tendon structures could be seen with higher clarity in the 7T T1 and T2 weighted images. SWI allowed high resolution and better quality imaging of large and medium sized arteries and veins, capillary networks and arteriovenous anastomoses at 7T when compared to 3T. 7T diffusion weighted sequence [not performed at 3T] demonstrates that the forearm nerves are clearly delineated by fiber tractography. The proper digital palmar arteries and superficial palmar arch could also be clearly visualized using TOF nCE 7T MRI. Conclusion Ultra-high resolution neurovascular imaging in upper extremities is possible at 7T without use of renal toxic intravenous contrast. 7T MRI can provide superior peripheral nerve [based on fiber anisotropy and diffusion coefficient parameters derived from diffusion tensor/spectrum imaging] and vascular [nCE MRA and vessel segmentation] imaging.Copyright © 2017 Raval et al.

N2  - PURPOSE: The speed limit for three-dimensional Fourier-encoded steady state free  precession (SSFP) imaging is explored on a clinical whole body system and pushed toward a pulse repetition time (TR) close to or even below the 1 ms regime; in the following referred to as ultra-fast SSFP imaging. METHODS: To this end, contemporary optimization strategies, such as efficient gradient switching patterns, partial echoes, ramp sampling techniques, and a target-related design of excitation pulses were applied to explore the lower boundaries in TR for SSFP-based Cartesian imaging. RESULTS: Generally, minimal TR was limited in vivo by peripheral nerve stimulation, allowing a TR ∼1 ms for isotropic resolutions down to about 2 mm. As a result, ultra-fast balanced SSFP provides artifact-free images even for targets with severe susceptibility variations, and native high-resolution structural and functional in vivo (1)H imaging of the human lung is demonstrated at 1.5 T. CONCLUSION: On clinical whole body MRI systems, the TR of SSFP-based Cartesian imaging can be pushed toward the 1 ms regime. As a result, ultra-fast SSFP protocols might represent a promising new powerful approach for SSFP-based imaging, not only for lung but also in a variety of clinical and scientific applications.

N2  - ABSTRACT: Imaging of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) has demonstrated key diffusion tensor imaging-based diffusivity alterations in the trigeminal nerve; however, imaging has primarily focused on the peripheral nerve segment because of previous limitations in reliably segmenting small fiber bundles across multiple subjects. We used Selective Automated Group Integrated Tractography to study 36 subjects with TN (right-sided pain) and 36 sex-matched controls to examine the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve [CN V]), pontine decussation (TPT), and thalamocortical fibers (S1). Gaussian process classifiers were trained by scrolling a moving window over CN V, TPT, and S1 tractography centroids. Fractional anisotropy (FA), generalized FA, radial diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity metrics were evaluated for both groups, analyzing TN vs control groups and affected vs unaffected sides. Classifiers that performed at greater-than-or-equal-to 70% accuracy were included. Gaussian process classifier consistently demonstrated bilateral trigeminal changes, differentiating them from controls with an accuracy of 80%. Affected and unaffected sides could be differentiated from each other with 75% accuracy. Bilateral TPT could be distinguished from controls with at least 85% accuracy. TPT left-right classification achieved 98% accuracy. Bilateral S1 could be differentiated from controls, where the affected S1 radial diffusivity classifier achieved 87% accuracy. This is the first TN study that combines group-wise merged tractography, machine learning classification, and analysis of the complete trigeminal pathways from the peripheral fibers to S1 cortex. This analysis demonstrates that TN is characterized by bilateral abnormalities throughout the trigeminal pathway compared with controls and abnormalities between affected and unaffected sides. This full pathway tractography study of TN demonstrates bilateral changes throughout the trigeminal pathway and changes between affected and unaffected sides.

N2  - Trigeminal neuralgia, painful trigeminal neuropathy, and painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are chronic orofacial pain conditions that are thought to have fundamentally different etiologies. Trigeminal neuralgia and neuropathy are thought to arise from damage to or pressure on the trigeminal nerve, whereas TMD results primarily from peripheral nociceptor activation. This study sought to assess the volume and microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in these 3 conditions. In 9 neuralgia, 18 neuropathy, 20 TMD, and 26 healthy controls, the trigeminal root entry zone was selected on high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and the volume (mm3) calculated. Additionally, using diffusion-tensor images (DTIs), the mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values of the trigeminal nerve root were calculated. Trigeminal neuralgia patients displayed a significant (47%) decrease in nerve volume but no change in DTI values. Conversely, trigeminal neuropathy subjects displayed a significant (40%) increase in nerve volume but again no change in DTI values. In contrast, TMD subjects displayed no change in volume or DTI values. The data suggest that the changes occurring within the trigeminal nerve are not uniform in all orofacial pain conditions. These structural and volume changes may have implications in diagnosis and management of different forms of chronic orofacial pain. Perspective(s): This study reveals that neuropathic orofacial pain conditions are associated with changes in trigeminal nerve volume, whereas non-neuropathic orofacial pain is not associated with any change in nerve volume. © 2013 by the American Pain Society.

N2  - X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy caused by mutations in the connexin 32 (Cx32) gene. Cx32 is widely expressed in brain and peripheral nerve, yet clinical manifestations of CMTX mainly arise from peripheral neuropathy. We have evaluated two male patients with CMTX who on separate occasions developed transient ataxia, dysarthria, and weakness within 3 days of returning from ski trips at altitudes above 8,000 feet. Magnetic resonance imaging studies in both patients showed nonenhancing, confluent, and symmetrical white matter abnormalities that were more pronounced posteriorly and that resolved over fseveral months. Magnetic transfer images in one patient demonstrated increased magnetization transfer ratios distinct from that seen in demyelination or edema. Both patients returned to their normal baseline within 2 to 3 weeks. These cases suggest that CMTX patients are at risk for developing an acute, transient, neurological syndrome when they travel to places at high altitudes and return to sea level. Cx32 mutations may cause central nervous system dysfunction by reducing the number of functioning gap junctions between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, making both cells more susceptible to abnormalities of intercellular exchange of ions and small molecules in situations of metabolic stress.

N2  - The median nerve is one of the most commonly affected peripheral nerves in various pathologies such as entrapment syndromes or transections. The diagnostic procedures applied in these situations are electromyography, physical examination methods, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used mostly in imaging the central nervous system (CNS) to visualize white matter tracts. Several studies have shown the clinical applications of DTI in neuronal disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, and CNS tumors. Recently, peripheral nerves have been visualized with DTI. Also, in several pathologies such as carpal tunnel syndrome and transection of the median nerve, on postoperative follow-up anisotropy indexes were shown to be affected. However, new studies with larger series are needed. Copyright © 2009 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - The assessment of human peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles by means of diffusion tensor imaging and tractograpy has been a recent area of research. These techniques have been successfully applied in both volunteers and patients, providing non-invasively, quantitative microstructural parameters (mainly mean fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient) and offering a three-dimensional visualization tool of nerves and muscles fibers. DTI and tractography may reveal abnormalities that are beyond the resolution of conventional MR techniques and hence open the way to potential clinical applications. In this article, we will first summarize the current state of DTI and tractography in the evaluation of peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles as well as their potential future clinical applications. Then, we will address important technical considerations, which understanding is necessary to appropriately apply DTI and tractograhy, and in order to understand the current limitations of these innovative and promising techniques. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - We are developing a simulator of peripheral nerve block utilizing a mixed-reality approach: the combination of a physical model, an MRI-derived virtual model, mechatronics and spatial tracking. Our design uses tangible (physical) interfaces to simulate surface anatomy, haptic feedback during needle insertion, mechatronic display of muscle twitch corresponding to the specific nerve stimulated, and visual and haptic feedback for the injection syringe. The twitch response is calculated incorporating the sensed output of a real neurostimulator. The virtual model is isomorphic with the physical model and is derived from segmented MRI data. This model provides the subsurface anatomy and, combined with electromagnetic tracking of a sham ultrasound probe and a standard nerve block needle, supports simulated ultrasound display and measurement of needle location and proximity to nerves and vessels. The needle tracking and virtual model also support objective performance metrics of needle targeting technique.

N2  - Pathologic conditions of the brachial plexus often result in serious and disabling complications. With the increasing availability and use of new and powerful MRI sequences and coils, understanding and assessment of the complex anatomy and pathology of the brachial plexus have been greatly facilitated. These new technical developments have led to an improved assessment of brachial plexus lesions, thereby improving patient care. In this article we describe various MRI techniques for the evaluation of the brachial plexus obtained at 1.5 T and 3 T, and we explain differences and similarities between sequences and protocols performed on MRI equipment from different vendors. The main characteristics of pathologic conditions affecting the brachial plexus are discussed and illustrated, as well as their differential diagnoses, with an emphasis on key imaging findings and relevance for patient management. Pitfalls related to suboptimal technique and image interpretation are also addressed. © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Objectives To achieve 3-dimensional (3D) display of peripheral nerves in the wrist region by using maximum intensity projection (MIP) post-processing methods to reconstruct raw images acquired by a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan, and to explore its clinical applications. Methods We performed DTI scans in 6 (DTI6) and 25 (DTI25) diffusion directions on 20 wrists of 10 healthy young volunteers, 6 wrists of 5 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, 6 wrists of 6 patients with nerve lacerations, and one patient with neurofibroma. The MIP post-processing methods employed 2 types of DTI raw images: (1) single-direction and (2) T2-weighted trace. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median and ulnar nerves were measured at multiple testing sites. Two radiologists used custom evaluation scales to assess the 3D nerve imaging quality independently. Results In both DTI6 and DTI25, nerves in the wrist region could be displayed clearly by the 2 MIP post-processing methods. The FA and ADC values were not significantly different between DTI6 and DTI25, except for the FA values of the ulnar nerves at the level of pisiform bone (p = 0.03). As to the imaging quality of each MIP post-processing method, there were no significant differences between DTI6 and DTI25 (p &gt; 0.05). The imaging quality of single-direction MIP post-processing was better than that from T2-weighted traces (p &lt; 0.05) because of the higher nerve signal intensity. Conclusions Three-dimensional displays of peripheral nerves in the wrist region can be achieved by MIP post-processing for single-direction images and T2-weighted trace images for both DTI6 and DTI25. The FA and ADC values of the median nerves can be accurately measured by using DTI6 data. Adopting 6-direction DTI scan and MIP post-processing is an efficient method for evaluating peripheral nerves. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: Peripheral nerve injury is a common and important cause of morbidity and disability in patients who have suffered a traumatic injury, particularly younger people. Various different injuries can result in damage to specific nerves. In patients with multiple trauma, the prevalence of peripheral nerve injury is estimated at 2.8%, but can reach 5% with the inclusion of brachial plexus involvement. Physical examination, as well as the origin and location of the trauma, can indicate the nerve involved and the type of nerve damage. However, the depth and severity of damage, and the structures involved often cannot be determined initially, but depend on longer periods of observation to reach a definitive and accurate diagnosis for which treatment can be proposed. Current approaches to locate and assess the severity of traumatic nerve injury involve clinical and electrodiagnostic studies. From a clinical and neurophysiological point of view, nerve injuries are classified in an attempt to correlate the degree of injury with symptoms, type of pathology, and prognosis, as well as to determine the therapy to be adopted. Objectives: MRI in the diagnosis of traumatic peripheral nerve injury has increasingly been used by surgeons in clinical practice. In this article, we analyze the use of magnetic resonance (MR) for the evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve diseases that are surgically treatable. We also consider basic concepts in the evaluation of technical and MR signs of peripheral nerve injuries. Materials and methods: Studies were identified following a computerized search of MEDLINE (1950 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present), and the Cochrane database. The MEDLINE search was conducted on PUBMED, the EMBASE search was conducted on OVID, and the Cochrane database was conducted using their online library. A set was created using the terms: ‘traumatic’, ‘nerve’, and ‘resonance’. Results: The included articles were identified using a computerized search and the resulting databases were then sorted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This yielded 10,340 articles (MEDLINE, n = 758; EMBASE, n = 9564; and Cochrane, n = 18). A search strategy was then built by excluding articles that only concern plexus injury and adding the terms ‘neuropathies’, ‘DTI’ and ‘neurotmesis’. In total, seven studies were included in the review effectively addressing the role of MRI in the evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injury. We extracted all relevant information on the imaging findings and the use of magnetic resonance in trauma. We did not include technical or specific radiological aspects of the imaging techniques. Conclusions: These seven articles were subsequently evaluated by analyzing their results, methodological approach, and conclusions presented. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.

N2  - Botulinum neurotoxin A (BTX-A) intervention has long-term benefits for children with obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP). Although cortical plasticity has been widely studied, plasticity in white matter has not received as much attention. Here, six children with OBPP underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before and 6 months after BTX-A treatment. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded. The aim was to investigate changes in the corticospinal tract (CST) as an example longitudinal observation of white matter plasticity. Deterministic fiber tracking with a Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking algorithm was used to reconstruct the CST. Fiber tracts passing through a region of interest (ROI) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and a target ROI in the upper-limb representation of M1 (defined by task-related fMRI) were selected as the CST. Motor performances were improved while EMG showed no significant difference 6 months after the treatment. We observed a significant increase in mean fractional anisotropy and a significant decrease in fiber number after treatment. We analyzed the correlations between DTI metrics and clinical motor assessments. Although the correlation results were not statistically significant, they support the notion that BTX-A treatment causes white matter plasticity and has a positive long-term outcome. Peripheral deafferentation may lead to altered information flow, resulting in the positive adaptation of white matter. This study provides novel insight into cerebral plasticity following peripheral nerve regeneration and indicates that a combination of relatively non-invasive therapies can accelerate plasticity of sensorimotor circuits and promote functional recovery in OBPP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN: We examined the chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) patients and non-CIDP patients who have similar symptoms and difficult to differential diagnosis with CIDP by magnetic resonance neurography to find the difference among them. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differential diagnostic value of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) for CIDP and other peripheral neuropathies. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Thirty-two consecutive patients with CIDP and 22 non-CIDP patients with symptoms similar to CIDP and difficult to be discriminate were recruited and imaged as a control group between May 2017 and May 2019. METHODS: In this prospective study, the brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus of 32 CIDP patients and 22 non-CIDP patients were examined by MRN. The clinical features and the nerve roots cross-sectional area (CSA) of the brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus were measured. RESULTS: The CSA of nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1 and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes syndrome patients were all shown extensive by MRN. The sensitivity of MRN in diagnosing CIDP was 81.25% (26/32), the specificity was 68.18% (15/22), the positive predictive value was 78.79% (26/33), the negative predictive value was 71.43% (15/21), the accuracy was 75.93% (40/54), the misdiagnosis rate was 24.07% (13/54), and the kappa value was 0.498. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed higher diagnostic accuracy for CIDP with the CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.762) and that of the brachial plexus (AUC = 0.762), and the combined of both examinations did not improve the diagnostic efficacy compared with either (AUC = 0.769). CONCLUSIONS: The nerve roots of CIDP, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type-1, and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein, and skin changes syndrome were difficult to distinguish by MRN. Atypical CIDP patients had less nerve root injury compared with typical CIDP patients. MRN of either the brachial plexus or the lumbosacral plexus had a high diagnostic accuracy for CIDP, and it is not necessary to perform both parts of the examination.2.

N2  - Magnetic resonance techniques have become increasingly important in neurology for defining: 1 brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerve or muscle structure; 2 pathological changes in tissue structures and properties; and 3 dynamic patterns of functional activation of the brain. New applications have been driven in part by advances in hardware, particularly improvements in magnet and gradient coil design. New imaging strategies allow novel approaches to contrast with, for example, diffusion imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, perfusion imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging. In parallel with developments in hardware and image acquisition have been new approaches to image analysis. These have allowed quantitative descriptions of the image changes to be used for a precise, non-invasive definition of pathology. With the increasing capabilities and specificity of magnetic resonance techniques it is becoming more important that the neurologist is intimately involved in both the selection of magnetic resonance studies for patients and their interpretation. There is a need for considerably improved access to magnetic resonance technology, particularly in the acute or intensive care ward and in the neurosurgical theatre. This report illustrates several key developments. The task force concludes that magnetic resonance imaging is a major clinical tool of growing significance and offers recommendations for maximizing the potential future for magnetic resonance techniques in neurology.

N2  - Purpose of Review: Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used as a problem-solving tool for diagnosis and management of peripheral neuropathies. This review is aimed at summarizing important technological advances, including MR pulse sequence and surface coil developments, which have facilitated MRN’s use in clinical practice. Recent Findings: The most recent research in MRN focuses on its clinical applications, with concomitant development of three-dimensional, parallel imaging and vascular suppression techniques that facilitate higher spatial resolution and depiction of small nerve branches arising from the brachial and lumbosacral plexi as well as fascicular abnormalities of more distal extremity nerves. Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been studied as a tool to detect microstructural abnormalities of peripheral nerves and more precisely define grades of nerve injury but will require additional investigation to determine its role in daily clinical practice. Summary: MRN continues to evolve due to technological improvements and awareness by the medical community of its capabilities. Additional technological developments related to surface coil designs and vascular suppression techniques will be needed to move the field forward. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - This article examines the T2 relaxation characteristics of the median nerve. Knowledge of the T2 relaxation time is essential to optimize clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and to enhance the visibility of pathophysiological changes in tissues. The T2 relaxation time of the median nerve is short relative to the T2 of other tissues like white and gray matter, for instance, and it decreases with increasing field strength of the MR scanner. A T2 relaxation time of ~50 milliseconds (ms) and ~20 ms were reported at 1.5 T and 7 T, respectively. Detailed measurements at 3.0 T revealed a biexponential decay characterized by two T2 components, at ~30 ms and ~100 ms, with normalized amplitudes of ~80% and ~20%, respectively. These two components possibly result from spatial compartmentation of water into intra-axonal and interaxonal spaces. The ability to assess microanatomical compartments within the median nerve could provide a method to study in vivo biophysical properties of nerves and could offer a means to investigate neurodegenerative diseases.

N2  - Objective: To detect and quantify lesions of the small-caliber sural nerve (SN) in symptomatic and asymptomatic transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in correlation with electrophysiologic and histopathologic findings. Methods: Twenty-five patients with TTR-FAP, 10 asymptomatic carriers of the mutated transthyretin gene (mutTTR), and 35 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were prospectively included in this cross-sectional case-control study. All participants underwent 3T MRN with high-structural resolution (fat-saturated, T2-weighted, and double-echo sequences). Total imaging time wasz45 minutes per patient. Manual SN segmentation was performed from its origin at the sciatic nerve bifurcation to the lower leg with subsequent evaluation of quantitative microstructural and morphometric parameters. Additional time needed for postprocessing was z1.5 hours per participant. Detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic examinations were conducted in the TTR group. Results: T2 signal and proton spin density (r) reliably differentiated between TTR-FAP (198.06 13.3, 429.6 6 15.25), mutTTR carriers (137.0 6 16.9, p 5 0.0009; 354.7 6 21.64, p 5 0.0029), and healthy controls (90.0 6 3.4, 258.2 6 9.10; p , 0.0001). Marked differences between mutTTR carriers and controls were found for T2 signal (p50.0065) and r (p,0.0001). T2 relaxation timewas higher in patients with TTR-FAP only (p 5 0.015 vs mutTTR carriers, p 5 0.0432 vs controls). SN caliber was higher in patients with TTR-FAP vs controls and in mutTTR carriers vs controls (p , 0.0001). Amyloid deposits were histopathologically detectable in 10 of 14 SN specimens. Conclusions: SN injury in TTR-FAP is detectable and quantifiable in vivo byMRNeven in asymptomatic mutTTR carriers. Differences in SN T2 signal between controls and asymptomaticmutTTR carriers are derived mainly from an increase of r, which overcomes typical limitations of established diagnostic methods as a highly sensitive imaging biomarker for early detection of peripheral nerve lesions. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that MRN accurately identifies asymptomatic mutTTR carriers. © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Background and purpose: The autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the SACS gene. The disease, first described in Canadian families from Quebec, is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract involvement and peripheral neuropathy. Method(s): Analysis of SACS gene allowed the identification of 14 patients with ARSACS from 13 unrelated Italian families. Clinical phenotype, gene mutations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were analysed. Result(s): We found 16 novel SACS gene mutations, including a large in-frame deletion. The age at onset was in infancy, but one patient presented the first symptoms at age 32. Progression of the disease was variable, and increased muscle tone was mostly recognized in later stages. Structural MRI showed atrophy of the superior cerebellar vermis, a bulky pons exhibiting T2-hypointense stripes, identified as the corticospinal tract (CST), thinning of the corpus callosum and a rim of T2-hyperintensity around the thalami in 100% of cases. The presence of iron or other paramagnetic substances was excluded. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed grossly over-represented transverse pontine fibres (TPF), which prevented reconstruction of the CST at this level (100% of cases). In all patients, significant microstructural alterations were found in the supratentorial white matter of forceps, cingulum and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Conclusion(s): Our findings further enlarge the genetic spectrum of SACS mutations and widen the study of clinical phenotype. MRI characteristics indicate that pontine changes and supratentorial abnormalities are diagnostic. The over-representation of TPF on DTI suggests a developmental component in the pathogenesis of the disease. © 2012 The Author(s) European Journal of Neurology © 2012 EFNS.

N2  - Background: Peripheral nerves at the elbow region are prone to entrapment neuropathies and injuries. To make accurate assessment, clinicians need stereoscopic display of the nerves to observe them at all angles. Objectives: To obtain a stereoscopic display of the peripheral nerves at the elbow region based on magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using three post-processing methods of volume rendering (VR), maximum intensity projection (MIP), and fiber tractography, and to evaluate the difference and correlation between them. Subjects and Methods: Twenty-four elbows of 12 healthy young volunteers were assessed by 20 encoding diffusion direction MR DTI scans. Images belonging to a single direction (anterior-posterior direction, perpendicular to the nerve) were subjected to VR and MIP reconstruction. All raw DTI data were transferred to the Siemens MR workstation for fiber tractography post-processing. Imaging qualities of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were evaluated by two observers independently based on a custom evaluation scale. Results: Stereoscopic displays of the nerves were obtained in all 24 elbows by VR, MIP, and fiber tractography post-processing methods. The VR/MIP post-processing methods were easier to perform compared to fiber tractography. There was no significant difference among the scores of fiber tracking and VR/MIP reconstruction for single direction. The imaging quality scores of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were significantly correlated based on intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis (ICC ranged 0.709 - 0.901), which suggested that the scores based on fiber tractography and VR/MIP for the same sample were consistent. Inter- and intraobserver agreements were good to excellent. Conclusion: Stereoscopic displays of the peripheral nerves at the elbow region can be achieved by using VR, MIP, and fiber tracking post-processing methods based on raw DTI images. VR and MIP reconstruction could be used as preview tools before fiber tracking to determine whether the raw images are satisfactory. © 2016, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Iranian Society of Radiology.

N2  - The pathogenesis of diabetic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP) is poorly understood but there is some evidence that the disease process might extend beyond peripheral nerves. We used magnetic-resonance imaging to measure spinal-cord cross-sectional area in diabetic patients with and without DSP and in healthy controls. There were significant differences in cord area between the groups at C4/5 and T3/4 (p=0.004 and p=0.033, respectively), with a smaller cord area in those with DSP compared with controls (p=0.001 and p=0.016 for C4/5 and T3/4, respectively). These results indicate that DSP is not simply a disease of the peripheral nerve and that there is substantial involvement of the spinal cord.

N2  - Introduction: We investigated whether MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of the cervical spinal cord could aid the (differential) diagnosis of sensory neuronopathies, an underdiagnosed group of diseases of the peripheral nervous system. Methods: We obtained spinal cord DTI and T2WI at 3 T from 28 patients, 14 diabetic subjects with sensory-motor distal polyneuropathy, and 20 healthy controls. We quantified DTI-based parameters and looked at the hyperintense T2W signal at the spinal cord posterior columns. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity values at C2–C3 and C3–C4 levels were compared between groups. We also compared average fractional anisotropy (mean of values at C2–C3 and C3–C4 levels). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine diagnostic accuracy of average fractional anisotropy, and we compared its sensitivity against the hyperintense signal in segregating patients from the other subjects. Results: Mean age and disease duration were 52 ± 10 and 11.4 ± 9.3 years in the patient group. Eighteen subjects had idiopathic disease and 6 dysimmune etiology. Fractional anisotropy at C3–C4 level and average fractional anisotropy were significantly different between patients and healthy controls (p < 0.001 and <0.001) and between patients and diabetic subjects (p = 0.019 and 0.027). Average fractional anisotropy presented an area under the curve of 0.838. Moreover, it had higher sensitivity than visual detection of the hyperintense signal (0.86 vs. 0.54), particularly for patients with short disease duration. Conclusion: DTI-based analysis enables in vivo detection of posterior column damage in sensory neuronopathy patients and is a useful diagnostic test for this condition. It also helps the differential diagnosis between sensory neuronopathy and distal polyneuropathies. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - This report details previously undescribed sonographic findings in the anterior interosseous nerve syndrome. Loss of muscle bulk, increased reflectivity, reduced perfusion on Doppler sonography, and lack of active contraction of the affected muscles were observed. These findings can aid in the localization of the pathologic process and in the exclusion of tendon rupture. Dynamic observation of muscle function and Doppler changes after exercise can also help identify the muscles involved. Both sonography and MRI may be useful in the evaluation of patients with the anterior interosseous nerve syndrome and other peripheral neuropathies.

N2  - MRI may provide treatment outcome measures in neuromuscular conditions. The authors assessed MRI magnetisation transfer ratios (MTRs) in lower-limb musculature as markers of pathology in peripheral neuropathies and compared the findings with associated clinical data. Ten patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) and nine patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) were compared with 10 healthy subjects. The MTR in the calf muscles was significantly lower than controls in the two patient groups (both p<0.001). The median MTRs (IQR) were 50.5(1.6) percentage units (p.u.) (control), 41.5 (10.6) p.u. (CMT1A) and 39.3(8.7) p.u. (CIDP). Moreover, anterior lower leg MTR correlated strongly with strength of ankle dorsiflexion, measured with the Medical Research Council scale, in CIDP (rho=0.88, p<0.001) and also in CMT1A (r=0.50, p<0.05), where MTR also showed an association with disease duration (rho=-0.86, p<0.001). Short tau inversion recovery MRI of the same muscles showed abnormalities associated with regions of reduced MTR (p<0.001), and MTR was also reduced in other muscles otherwise deemed normal appearing (p<0.001), indicating that MTR may be more sensitive to muscle damaged by denervation than conventional MRI. The significant reductions in muscle MTR in peripheral neuropathies and the associated correlations with clinical measures indicate that MTR has potential as an imaging outcome measure in future therapeutic trials.

N2  - Identifying the extent of involvement of the vessel and nerve, particularly in regard to preoperative evaluation and precise localization of the tumor and its relation to the structures of the extremities, has important applications for advancing the treatment of lower extremity diseases. To review the technical feasibility of simultaneous visualization of nerves and vessels of the lower extremities by using magnetization-prepared susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MP-SWI) at 3.0T. Ten healthy volunteers and 10 patients were studied. Optimized MP-SWI, MR neurography (MRN) based on 3D diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession imaging and contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) sequences were performed for each subject. The means of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)n, SNRv, SNRm, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)n,m and CNRv,m were calculated and the certainty of identifying nerves and vessels was determined. CNRn,m between MP-SWI and MRN, and CNRv,m between MP-SWI and CE-MRA were compared. MP-SWI provides slightly poorer CNRv,m than CE-MRA, whereas MP-SWI provides a better CNRn,m than MRN. In thin-slice-thickness maximum-intensity projection arbitrary planes, the sciatic nerve and its branches were clearly identified (score 1 or 2 of 2) in 17 subjects (85%); the femoral artery and the main branches were identified (score 1 or 2 of 2) in all 20 subjects (100%). The nerves are isointense to slightly hypointense to muscle, and the vessels show a more obvious hyperintense signal than muscle in MP-SWI. The proposed MP-SWI demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneously visualizing nerves and vessels of the lower extremities without using an exogenous contrast agent. It may enable straightforward localization of a disease process to a specific nerve and vessel.

N2  - Purpose: MR neurography is known to be useful to evaluate nerve pathology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with nerve-sheath signal increased with inked rest-tissue rapid acquisition of relaxation enhancement imaging (SHINKEI) to distinguish patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) from healthy subjects. Material(s) and Method(s): This retrospective study included 13 patients with CIDP and five healthy subjects from 2015 to 2017. The T2 relaxation time and the size of the cervical ganglia and roots of the brachial plexus were measured. Statistical analyses were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Result(s): The T2 relaxation times of the ganglia and roots were longer in patients with CIDP (119.31 +/- 35.53 msec and 111.15 +/- 33.82 msec) than in healthy subjects (101.42 +/- 26.42 msec and 85.29 +/- 13.22 msec, P = 0.0007 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The sizes of the ganglia and the roots were larger in patients with CIDP (6.25 +/- 1.56 mm and 4.37 +/- 1.71 mm) than in healthy subjects (5.59 +/- 1.08 mm and 3.50 +/- 0.62 mm, P = 0.0114 and P = 0.0014, respectively). ROC analysis revealed that T2 relaxation time of the roots was best at distinguishing CIDP patients from healthy subjects (the area under the curve = 0.748). Conclusion(s): Patients with CIDP could be distinguished from healthy subjects using simultaneous apparent T2 mapping and neurography with SHINKEI.Copyright © 2018

N2  - This study aims to find accurate angles and depths of lateral ventricle puncture using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reconstruction, as well as to provide an optimized and alternative puncturing strategy. A total of 90 computed tomography (CT) images and 30 CT images with DTI were analyzed. The measurements were performed on coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes. Some distances and angles were measured to determine the best angle and penetration depth during the puncture process. Important landmarks of the lateral ventricle were also measured, and a comparison of the differences between 2 hemispheres was also assessed. It showed that the vertical distance from the superior margin to inferior margin of the lateral ventricle was 22.2±0.5mm and the length was 124.1±2.1mm. In the frontal horn puncture approach, the penetration depth should be limited between 105.2 and 109.4 mm, the angle should be 71.6±2.7°. During the occipital horn puncture approach, puncturing depth was from 90.7 to 111.4mm, and angle was 15.3±1.8°. Through the parietal lobe puncture approach, which was firstly brought out in this study, the puncturing length should be 124.4 to 130.2mm and angle was 56.6±2.0°. The traditional recommended protocol of lateral ventricle puncture is not accurate, the refined lateral ventricle puncture protocol established in this study will reduce injury and remain function. A DTI imaging examination combining with nerve fibers reconstruction were strongly recommended before lateral ventricle puncture, which will help neurosurgeons to determine the best puncturing angles and depth. © 2018 the Author(s).

N2  - Diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies relies on neurological examinations, electrodiagnostic studies, and since recently magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a fully-automatic segmentation method of peripheral nerves of the thigh. T2-weighted sequences without fat suppression acquired on a 3 T MR scanner were retrospectively analyzed in 10 healthy volunteers and 42 patients suffering from clinically and electrophysiologically diagnosed sciatic neuropathy. A fully-convolutional neural network was developed to segment the MRN images into peripheral nerve and background tissues. The performance of the method was compared to manual inter-rater segmentation variability. The proposed method yielded Dice coefficients of 0.859 ± 0.061 and 0.719 ± 0.128, Hausdorff distances of 13.9 ± 26.6 and 12.4 ± 12.1 mm, and volumetric similarities of 0.930 ± 0.054 and 0.897 ± 0.109, for the healthy volunteer and patient cohorts, respectively. The complete segmentation process requires less than one second, which is a significant decrease to manual segmentation with an average duration of 19 ± 8 min. Considering cross-sectional area or signal intensity of the segmented nerves, focal and extended lesions might be detected. Such analyses could be used as biomarker for lesion burden, or serve as volume of interest for further quantitative MRN techniques. We demonstrated that fully-automatic segmentation of healthy and neuropathic sciatic nerves can be performed from standard MRN images with good accuracy and in a clinically feasible time. © 2007-2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

N2  - Schwannomatosis is a distinct syndrome characterized by multiple peripheral nerve schwannomas that can be sporadic or familial in nature. Cases affecting the lower cranial nerves are infrequent. Here, the authors present a rare case of schwannomatosis affecting the left spinal accessory nerve. Upon genetic screening, an in-frame insertion at codon p.R177 of the Sox 10 gene was observed. There were no identifiable alterations in NF1, NF2, LZTR1, and SMARCB1. This case demonstrates a rare clinical presentation of schwannomatosis in addition to a genetic aberration that has not been previously reported in this disease context.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart.

N2  - Objective: Diabetes mellitus has a high incidence in general population and goes by high morbidity by specific micro vascular pathology in the retina, renal glomerul and peripheral nerves. In type 1 DM, intensive therapy can prevent or delay the development of long-term complications associated with DM but hypoglycaemia especially severe hypoglycaemia defined, as a low blood glucose resulting in stupor, seizure, or unconsciousness that precludes self-treatment is a serious threat. Hypoglycaemia that may preferentially harm neurons in the medial temporal region, specifically the hippocampus, is a potential danger for the brain cognitive function which several studies failed to detect any significant effects, whereas others indicated an influence on it. A young diabetic case presented here with severe cognitive defect. Great number of severe hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic attacks and convulsion episodes were described in his medical history. Results and conclusion: Neuroradiologic findings on CT and MRI, pointed that global cerebral atrophy that is incompatible with his age. Brain perfusion studies (SPECT, 99mTc-labeled HMPAO) also showed that there were severe perfusion defects at superior temporal region and less perfusion defects at gyrus cingulim in frontal region. These regions are related with memory processing. Severe cognitive defect in this patient seems to be closely related these changes and no another reason was found to explain except the repeated severe hypoglycaemic episodes.

N2  - Objectives To assess the interreader and test-retest reliability of magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry in sciatic nerve MR neurography (MRN). Materials and methods In this prospective study, 21 healthy volunteers were examined three times on separate days by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 Tesla, consisting of an MTI sequence, a multi-echo T2 relaxometry sequence, and a high-resolution T2-weighted sequence. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density (PSD) of the sciatic nerve were assessed by two independent observers, and both interreader and test-retest reliability for all readout parameters were reported by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurement (SEM). Results For the sciatic nerve, overall mean ± standard deviation MTR was 26.75 ± 3.5%, T2 was 64.54 ± 8.2 ms, and PSD was 340.93 ± 78.8. ICCs ranged between 0.81 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for interreader reliability and between 0.75 (MTR) and 0.94 (PSD) for test-retest reliability. SEM for interreader reliability was 1.7% for MTR, 2.67 ms for T2, and 21.3 for PSD. SEM for test-retest reliability was 1.7% for MTR, 2.66 ms for T2, and 20.1 for PSD. Conclusions MTI and T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve are reliable and reproducible. The values of measurement imprecision reported here may serve as a guide for correct interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies. Key Points • Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) and T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve are reliable and reproducible. • The imprecision that is unavoidably associated with different scans or different readers can be estimated by the here presented SEM values for the biomarkers T2, PSD, and MTR. • These values may serve as a guide for correct interpretation of quantitative MRN biomarkers in future studies and possible clinical applications.

N2  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in the measurement of peripheral nerve integrity, although the optimal way to apply the technique for the study of lumbar spinal nerves is unclear. The aims of this study are to use an improved DTI acquisition to investigate lumbar nerve root integrity and correlate this with functional measures using neurophysiology. Method(s): Twenty healthy volunteers underwent 3 T DTI of the L5/S1 area. Regions of interest were applied to L5 and S1 nerve roots, and DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity) were derived. Neurophysiological measures were obtained from muscles innervated by L5/S1 nerves; these included the slope of motor-evoked potential input-output curves, F-wave latency, maximal motor response, and central and peripheral motor conduction times. Result(s): DTI metrics were similar between the left and right sides and between vertebral levels. Conversely, significant differences in DTI measures were seen along the course of the nerves. Regression analyses revealed that DTI metrics of the L5 nerve correlated with neurophysiological measures from the muscle innervated by it. Conclusion(s): The current findings suggest that DTI has the potential to be used for assessing lumbar spinal nerve integrity and that parameters derived from DTI provide quantitative information which reflects their function.Copyright © 2017, The Author(s).

N2  - Objective Thalamus is essential in processing of sensory information. This study explored the associations between thalamic volume and intra-Thalamic metabolites and associations to clinical and experimental characteristics of sensory function in adults with diabetic polyneuropathy. Methods 48 adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy (DPSN) and 28 healthy controls participated in a cross-sectional study and underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Estimates for thalamic volume were extracted using voxel-based morphometry and intra-Thalamic N-Acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/cre) levels were assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Associations between thalamic volume and clinical measures, quantitative sensory testing and neuropathic phenotype were explored. Results In diabetes, reduced gray matter volume was identified including bilateral thalamus (all p≤0.001) in comparison to healthy participants. Thalamic volume estimates were positively associated to intra-Thalamic NAA/cre (r=0.4; p=0.006), however not to diabetes duration (p=0.5), severity of DSPN (p=0.7), or presence of pain (p=0.3). Individuals with the lowest thalamic volume had greatest loss of protective sensation (light touch using von Frey-like filaments, p=0.037) and highest pain tolerance to electric stimulation (tetanic stimulation, p=0.008) compared to individuals with the highest thalamic volume. Conclusions In this cohort with type 1 diabetes and severe DSPN, thalamic atrophy was present and associated with reduced NAA/cre, indicating thalamic structural loss and dysfunction. Thalamic atrophy was associated to reduced sensory function involving large fiber neuropathy and sensation to tetanic stimulation that may reflect synaptic transmission. This may ultimately contribute to the current understanding of the pathophysiology behind the perception changes evident in DSPN. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

N2  - Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension of the popular diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique. DKI takes into account leading deviations from Gaussian diffusion stemming from a number of effects related to the microarchitecture and compartmentalization in biological tissues. DKI therefore offers increased sensitivity to subtle microstructural alterations over conventional diffusion imaging such as DTI, as has been demonstrated in numerous reports. For this reason, interest in routine clinical application of DKI is growing rapidly. In an effort to facilitate more widespread use of DKI, recent work by our group has focused on developing experimentally fast and robust estimates of DKI metrics. A significant increase in speed is made possible by a reduction in data demand achieved through rigorous analysis of the relation between the DKI signal and the kurtosis tensor based metrics. The fast DKI methods therefore need only 13 or 19 images for DKI parameter estimation compared to more than 60 for the most modest DKI protocols applied today. Closed form solutions also ensure rapid calculation of most DKI metrics. Some parameters can even be reconstructed in real time, which may be valuable in the clinic. The fast techniques are based on conventional diffusion sequences and are therefore easily implemented on almost any clinical system, in contrast to a range of other recently proposed advanced diffusion techniques. In addition to its general applicability, this also ensures that any acceleration achieved in conventional DKI through sequence or hardware optimization will also translate directly to fast DKI acquisitions. In this review, we recapitulate the theoretical basis for the fast kurtosis techniques and their relation to conventional DKI. We then discuss the currently available variants of the fast kurtosis techniques, their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their respective realms of application. These range from whole body applications to methods mostly suited for spinal cord or peripheral nerve, and analysis specific to brain white matter. Having covered these technical aspects, we proceed to review the fast kurtosis literature including validation studies, organ specific optimization studies and results from clinical applications. © 2017 Hansen and Jespersen.

N2  - Objective: To assess the discriminative power of radiomics of peripheral nerves at 1.5T MRI, using common entrapment neuropathies of the upper limb as a model system of focal nerve injury. Materials and methods: Radiomics was retrospectively done on peripheral nerve fascicles on T1-weighted 1.5T MRI of 40 patients with diagnosis of mild carpal (n = 25) and cubital tunnel (n = 15) syndrome and of 200 controls. Z-score normalization and Mann–Whitney U test were used to compare features of normal and pathological peripheral nerves. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. Results: A total of n = 104 radiomics features were computed for each patient and control. Significant differences between normal and pathological median and ulnar nerves were found in n = 23/104 features (p < 0.001). According to features classification, n = 5/23 features were shape-based, n = 7/23 were first-order features, n = 11/23 features were classified as gray level run length matrix. Nine of the selected features showed an AUC higher that 0.7: minimum AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.61–0.89) for sum variance and maximum AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.82–0.99) for zone entropy. Conclusion: Features analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences between normal and pathological nerve. The results suggested that radiomics analysis could assess the median and ulnar nerve inner structure changes due to the loss of the fascicular pattern, intraneural edema, fibrosis or fascicular alterations in mild carpal tunnel and mild cubital tunnel syndromes even when the nerve cross-sectional area does not change.

N2  - Background: This study explores whether objective, quantitative radiomic biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance (MR), positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT) may be useful in reliably distinguishing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) from benign plexiform neurofibromas (PN). Methods: A registration and segmentation pipeline was established using a cohort of NF1 patients with histopathological diagnosis of PN or MPNST, and medical imaging of the PN including MR and PET-CT. The corrected MR datasets were registered to the corresponding PET-CT via landmark-based registration. PET standard-uptake value (SUV) thresholds were used to guide segmentation of volumes of interest: MPNST-associated PET-hot regions (SUV ≥ 3.5) and PN-associated PET-elevated regions (2.0 < SUV < 3.5). Quantitative imaging features were extracted from the MR, PET, and CT data and compared for statistical differences. Intensity histogram features included (mean, media, maximum, variance, full width at half maximum, entropy, kurtosis, and skewness), while image texture was quantified using Law's texture energy measures, grey-level co-occurrence matrices, and neighborhood grey-tone difference matrices. Results: For each of the 20 NF1 subjects, a total of 320 features were extracted from the image data. Feature reduction and statistical testing identified 9 independent radiomic biomarkers from the MR data (4 intensity and 5 texture) and 4 PET (2 intensity and 2 texture) were different between the PET-hot versus PET-elevated volumes of interest. Conclusions: Our data suggests imaging features can be used to distinguish malignancy in NF1-realted tumors, which could improve MPNST risk assessment and positively impact clinical management of NF1 patients. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - Introduction: In this study, we aimed to determine whether muscle transverse relaxation time (T2) magnetic resonance (MR) mapping results correlate with motor unit loss, as defined by motor unit recruitment patterns on electromyography (EMG). Methods: EMG and 3-Tesla MRI exams were acquired no more than 31 days apart in subjects referred for peripheral nerve MRI. Two musculoskeletal radiologists qualitatively graded T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequences for severity of muscle edema-like patterns and manually placed regions of interest within muscles to obtain T2 values from T2-mapping sequences. Concordance was calculated between qualitative and quantitative MR grades and EMG recruitment categories (none, discrete, decreased) as well as interobserver agreement for both MR grades. Results: Thirty-four muscles (21 abnormal, 13 control) were assessed in 13 subjects (5 females and 8 males; mean age, 46 years) with 14 EMG-MRI pairs. T2-relaxation times were significantly (P &lt;.001) increased in all EMG recruitment categories compared with control muscles. T2 differences were not significant between EMG grades of motor unit recruitment (P =.151-.702). T2 and EMG score concordance was acceptable (Harrellʼs concordance index [c index]: rater A, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.87; rater B, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-0.91). Qualitative MRI and EMG score concordance was poor to acceptable (c index: rater A, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50-0.79; rater B, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89). T2 values had moderate-to-substantial ability to distinguish between absent vs incomplete (ie, decreased or discrete) motor unit recruitment (c index: rater A, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50-1.00; rater B, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.57-1.00). Discussion: Quantitative T2 MR muscle mapping is a promising tool for noninvasive evaluation of the degree of motor unit recruitment loss. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - Objectives: New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on 3D
fat-suppressed techniques provide high accuracy for evaluation of
brachial plexus and peripheral nerve lesions from a qualitative point of
view. However, this qualitative evaluation often demonstrates
overlapping features among different pathologies (Pullman a al., 2013).
Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are
functional MRI techniques that have been successfully applied in the
imaging of central nervous system lesions, and now are being imported,
with promising results for peripheral nerve and plexus evaluation.
Several derived parameters from DWI and DTI studies such as apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC) or fractional anisotropy (FA), can be used
as potential biomarkers of neural damage by providing information about
axonal flow, fiber organization or myelin integrity (Andreou a al.,
2015). In this study we assess the role of DW and DT based quantitative
measures in characterization of traumatic and non traumatic lesions of
brachial plexus and peripheral nerve and its influence on therapeutic
management and outcome.
Methods: 34 patients with features of brachial plexopathy and peripheral
neuropathy were included in the study. MR neurography examinations
included conventional MR sequences and unidirectional DW-MRN with
background suppression (DWIBS) and DTI. The images were independently
reviewed by two radiologists and the findings were recorded at different
levels of the brachial plexus: ganglia, roots, trunks, divisions and
cords. Mean ADC and FA values were determined within each lesion and
within contra lateral homologous unaffected segment of the plexus. The
Mann-Whitney Test was used to calculate the differences in ADC&FA
values between diseased and normal sides and the One way ANOVA test
between diseased segments of different pathologies with p-values < 0.05
being considered statistically significant.
Results: patients were classified according to etiologic causes into
four categories: traumatic, compressive degenerative disk, radiation
induced plexitis and neoplastic nerve compression or invasion. T2 high
signal intensity and swelling of the affected nerve, muscular
denervation and complication such as pseudo meningeocele and neuroma
were the major findings in qualitatitve sequences. A statistically
significant difference in ADC and FA values were found between diseased
and normal sides as well as across the traumatic and non traumatic
groups and between benign compressive and malignant infiltrative
etiologies.
Conclusion: The resulted values of newly designed quantitative protocols
give us functional and numerical marker by which the diagnosis and
differentiation of different pathologies of peripheral nerves and
brachial plexus will be more suitable.

N2  - ObjectiveTo characterize and quantify peripheral nerve lesions and muscle degeneration in clinically, genetically, and electrophysiologically well-classified, nonpediatric patients with 5q-linked spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) by high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography (MRN).MethodsThirty-one adult patients with genetically confirmed 5q-linked SMA types II, IIIa, and IIIb and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were prospectively investigated. All patients received neurologic, physiotherapeutic, and electrophysiologic assessments. MRN at 3.0T with anatomic coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to the tibiotalar joint was performed with dual-echo 2D relaxometry sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3D T2-weighted inversion recovery sequence. Detailed quantification of nerve injury by morphometric and microstructural MRN markers and qualitative classification of fatty muscle degeneration were conducted.ResultsEstablished clinical scores and compound muscle action potentials discriminated well between the 3 SMA types. MRN revealed that peroneal and tibial nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) at the thigh and lower leg level as well as spinal nerve CSA were markedly decreased throughout all 3 groups, indicating severe generalized peripheral nerve atrophy. While peroneal and tibial nerve T2 relaxation time was distinctly increased at all analyzed anatomic regions, the proton spin density was clearly decreased. Marked differences in fatty muscle degeneration were found between the 3 groups and for all analyzed compartments.ConclusionsMRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve involvement in SMA types II, IIIa, and IIIb with high sensitivity in vivo. Quantitative MRN parameters (T2 relaxation time proton spin density, CSA) might serve as novel imaging biomarkers in SMA to indicate early microstructural nerve tissue changes in response to treatment.Copyright © American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Traumatic conditions of peripheral nerves and plexus have been classically evaluated by morphological imaging techniques and electrophysiological tests. New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies based on 3D fat-suppressed techniques are providing high accuracy for peripheral nerve injury evaluation from a qualitative point of view. However, these techniques do not provide quantitative information. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are functional MRI techniques that are able to evaluate and quantify the movement of water molecules within different biological structures. These techniques have been successfully applied in other anatomical areas, especially in the assessment of central nervous system, and now are being imported, with promising results for peripheral nerve and plexus evaluation. DWI and DTI allow performing a qualitative and quantitative peripheral nerve analysis, providing valuable pathophysiological information about functional integrity of these structures. In the field of trauma and peripheral nerve or plexus injury, several derived parameters from DWI and DTI studies such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) or fractional anisotropy (FA) among others, can be used as potential biomarkers of neural damage providing information about fiber organization, axonal flow or myelin integrity. A proper knowledge of physical basis of these techniques and their limitations is important for an optimal interpretation of the imaging findings and derived data. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the potential applications of DWI and DTI neurographic studies is performed with a focus on traumatic conditions, including main nerve entrapment syndromes in both peripheral nerves and brachial or lumbar plexus. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery.

N2  - Objective: The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a novel magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) MRI assay of the proximal sciatic nerve (SN), which is inaccessible via current tools for assessing peripheral nerves, and (2) to evaluate the resulting MTR values as a potential biomarker of myelin content changes in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases. Method(s): MTR was measured in the SN of patients with CMT type 1A (CMT1A, n = 10), CMT type 2A (CMT2A, n = 3), hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (n = 3), and healthy controls (n = 21). Additional patients without a genetically confirmed subtype (n = 4), but whose family histories and electrophysiologic tests were consistent with CMT, were also included. The relationship between MTR and clinical neuropathy scores was assessed, and the interscan and inter-rater reliability of MTR was estimated. Result(s): Mean volumetric MTR values were significantly decreased in the SN of patients with CMT1A (33.8 +/- 3.3 percent units) and CMT2A (31.5 +/- 1.9 percent units) relative to controls (37.2 6 2.3 percent units). A significant relationship between MTR and disability scores was also detected (p = 0.01 for genetically confirmed patients only, p = 0.04 for all patients). From interscan and inter-rater reliability analyses, proximal nerve MTR values were repeatable at the slicewise and mean volumetric levels. Conclusion(s): MTR measurements may be a viable biomarker of proximal nerve pathology in patients with CMT.Copyright © 2014 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Axonotmesis of the left sciatic nerve was performed on adult male Wistar rats. T1 values of the crushed nerve samples were determined with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Denervation changes of the dependent hind plantar flexor muscles were assessed with proton magnetic resonance imaging of their cross-sectional area and muscle force measurements. However, Tl relaxation time of the crushed nerve samples remained prolonged implying the absence of nerve regeneration. This would be in contradiction with what is known about regeneration after simple crash and the muscle force and magnetic resonance imaging measurements of the dependent plantar flexor muscles. These studies indicated that sufficient nerve regeneration had taken place to restore their muscle force and volume. A model is suggested to explain the persistence of prolonged Tl values in the presence of muscle force recovery. © 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Nerve regeneration after injury must occur in a timely fashion to
restore function. Unfortunately, current methods (e.g.,
electrophysiology) provide limited information following trauma,
resulting in delayed management and suboptimal outcomes. Herein, we
evaluated the ability of diffusion MRI to monitor nerve regeneration
after injury/repair. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three
treatment groups (sham = 21, crush = 23, cut/repair = 19) and ex vivo
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was
performed 1-12 weeks post-surgery. Behavioral data showed a distinction
between crush and cut/repair nerves at 4 weeks. This was consistent with
DTI, which found that thresholds based on the ratio of radial and axial
diffusivities (RD/AD = 0.40 +/- 0.02) and fractional anisotropy (FA =
0.53 +/- 0.01) differentiated crush from cut/repair injuries. By the
12th week, cut/repair nerves whose behavioral data indicated a partial
recovery were below the RD/AD threshold (and above the FA threshold),
while nerves that did not recover were on the opposite side of each
threshold. Additional morphometric analysis indicated that DTI-derived
normalized scalar indices report on axon density (RD/AD: r = -0.54, p <
1e-3; FA: r = 0.56, p < 1e-3). Interestingly, higher-order DKI analyses
did not improve our ability classify recovery. These findings suggest
that DTI may provide promising biomarkers for distinguishing
successful/unsuccessful nerve repairs and potentially identify cases
that require reoperation.

N2  - Paresthesia-dominant and pain-dominant subgroups have been noted in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a peripheral neuropathic disorder characterized by altered primary somatosensory/motor (S1/M1) physiology. We aimed to investigate whether brain morphometry dissociates these subgroups. Subjects with CTS were evaluated with nerve conduction studies, whereas symptom severity ratings were used to allocate subjects into paresthesia-dominant (CTS-paresthesia), pain-dominant (CTS-pain), and pain/paresthesia nondominant (not included in further analysis) subgroups. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired at 3T using a multiecho MPRAGE T1-weighted pulse sequence, and gray matter cortical thickness was calculated across the entire brain using validated, automated methods. CTS-paresthesia subjects demonstrated reduced median sensory nerve conduction velocity (P 0.05) compared with CTS-pain subjects. In addition, cortical thickness in precentral and postcentral gyri (S1/M1 hand area) contralateral to the more affected hand was significantly reduced in CTS-paresthesia subgroup compared with CTS-pain subgroup. Moreover, in CTS-paresthesia subjects, precentral cortical thickness was negatively correlated with paresthesia severity (r(34) -0.40, P 0.016) and positively correlated with median nerve sensory velocity (r(36) 0.51, P 0.001), but not with pain severity. Conversely, in CTS-pain subjects, contralesional S1 (r(9) 0.62, P 0.042) and M1 (r(9) 0.61, P 0.046) cortical thickness were correlated with pain severity, but not median nerve velocity or paresthesia severity. This double dissociation in somatotopically specific S1/M1 areas suggests a neuroanatomical substrate for symptom-based CTS subgroups. Such fine-grained subgrouping of CTS may lead to improved personalized therapeutic approaches, based on superior characterization of the linkage between peripheral and central neuroplasticity. © 2016 International Association for the Study of Pain.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether pretreatment magnetic resonance (MR)-based radiomics  nomogram can individualize prediction of perineural invasion (PNI) status in rectal cancer (RC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 122 RC patients with pathologically confirmed were classified as training cohort (n = 87) and test cohort (n = 35). 180 radiomics features were extracted from all lesions based on oblique axial T(2)WI TSE images. The dimensionality reduction and feature selection in training cohort were realized by the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. A predictive model combining radiomics features and clinical risk factors (pathological N stage, pathological LVI status) was established by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The performance of the model was assessed based on its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, nomogram, and calibration. RESULTS: The developed radiomics nomogram that integrated the radiomics signature and clinical risk factors could provide discrimination in the training and test cohorts. The accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) for assessing PNI status were 0.82, 0.86, respectively, in the training cohort, while they were 0.71 and 0.85 in the test cohort. The goodness-of-fit of the nomogram was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p = 0.52 in training cohort and p = 0.24 in test cohort). Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: The developed radiomics nomogram might be helpful in the individualized assessment PNI status in patients with RC. This stratification of RC patients according to their PNI status may provide the basis for individualized adjuvant therapy, especially for stage II patients.

N2  - Objectives To use pre- and post-operative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to monitor median nerve integrity in patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methods Diffusivity and anisotropy images along the median nerve were compared among 12 patients, 12 age-matched and 12 young control subjects and correlated with electrophysiological neurography results. Slice-wise DTI parameter values were calculated to focus on local changes. Results Results of pre-operative patients and age-matched control subjects differed only in the distal nerve. Moreover, pre-operative patients differed significantly from young controls and post-operative patients. The main abnormalities were increased diffusivity and decreased anisotropy in the carpal tunnel and distal median nerve. Post-operative clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but not in anisotropy. Slice-wise analysis showed high pre-operative diffusivity at the distal nerve. All groups had relatively large inter-subject variation in both diffusivity and anisotropy. Conclusions DTI can provide information complementary to clinical examination, electrophysiological recordings and anatomical MRI of diseases and injuries of peripheral nerves. However, similar age-related changes in diffusivity and anisotropy may weaken DTI specificity. Slice-wise analysis is necessary for detection of local changes in nerve integrity. Key Points • Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging provides information complementary to conventional diagnostic methods. • Age caused similar changes to diffusivity and anisotropy as carpal tunnel syndrome. • Post-operative clinical improvement was reflected in diffusivity, but not in anisotropy. • Inter-subject variation in diffusivity and anisotropy was considerable. © European Society of Radiology 2012.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this work is to examine the architectural configuration and the microstructural substrate of the cervical spine and its nerve roots with post-mortem (PM) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in non-fixed subjects and to compare these findings with histology. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner in five non-fixed non-trauma deaths. Two different areas were evaluated: 1) the cervical spinal cord and ventral and dorsal nerve roots with a “high in-plane” DTI and a multi-echo fast field echo protocol, and 2) the cervical peripheral nerves with an “isotropic” DTI and a 3D turbo spin echo protocol. Histology samples were obtained matching the anatomical level of the slices of the ‘high in-plane’ DTI protocol. Results: We were able to show detailed reconstructions of the dorsal and ventral nerve roots with the ‘high in-plane’ protocol and identified a low fractional anisotropy (FA = 0.30 ± 0.08) in the grey matter and a high FA (0.51 ± 0.13) in the white matter. Both grey and white matter configurations correlated with the anatomical MRI, the diffusion MRI, and with the histological sections. Using the ‘isotropic’ DTI protocol, it was feasible to reconstruct the spinal cord, cervical nerves, and nerve roots in all PM subjects. Conclusion: We were able to generate detailed architectural configurations of the ventral and dorsal nerve roots. Anatomical and diffusion MR scans showed good qualitative agreement with histology. We believe that PMDTI will be helpful in the assessment of head and neck injuries in a forensic setting. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Plexiform Neurofibroma (PN) is a major complication of NeuroFibromatosis-1 (NF1), a common genetic disease that involving the nervous system. PNs are peripheral nerve sheath tumors extending along the length of the nerve in various parts of the body. Treatment decision is based on tumor volume assessment using MRI, which is currently time consuming and error prone, with limited semi-automatic segmentation support. We present in this paper a new method for the segmentation and tumor mass quantification of PN from STIR MRI scans. The method starts with a user-based delineation of the tumor area in a single slice and automatically detects the PN lesions in the entire image based on the tumor connectivity. Experimental results on seven datasets yield a mean volume overlap difference of 25% as compared to manual segmentation by expert radiologist with a mean computation and interaction time of 12 minutes vs. over an hour for manual annotation. Since the user interaction in the segmentation process is minimal, our method has the potential to successfully become part of the clinical workflow. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the ability of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI)
and T2 to help detect the mildest nerve lesion conceivable, that is,
subclinical ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.
Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the
institutional ethics board. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3.0 T
by using proton density-and T2-weighted relaxometry and DTI on elbows in
30 healthy subjects without clinical evidence of neuropathy.
Quantitative analysis of ulnar nerve T2 and fractional anisotropy (FA)
was performed, and T2 and FA values were correlated to electrical nerve
conduction velocities (NCVs) with Pearson correlation analysis.
Additional qualitative assessment of T2-weighted and FA images was
performed by two readers, and sensitivity and specificity were
calculated.
Results: Ten of the 30 subjects (33%) had NCV slowing across the elbow
segment. Compared with subjects without NCV slowing, subjects with
slowing had decreased FA values (0.51 +/- 0.09 vs 0.41 +/- 0.07,
respectively; P = .006) and increased T2 values (64.2 msec +/- 10.9 vs
76.2 msec +/- 13.7, respectively; P = .01) in the proximal ulnar sulcus.
FA values showed a significant correlation (P = .01) with NCV slowing
over the sulcus as an electrophysiologic indicator of myelin sheath
damage. Qualitative assessment of FA maps and T2-weighted images helped
identify subjects with conduction slowing with a sensitivity of 80% and
55%, respectively, and a specificity of 83% and 63%.
Conclusion: FA maps can accurately depict even mild peripheral
neuropathy and perform better than the current standard of reference,
T2-weighted images. DTI may therefore add diagnostic value as a highly
sensitive technique for the detection of peripheral neuropathy. (C)

N2  - We investigated the utility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for detecting neuropathic changes in proximal nerve segments in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Twenty-one individuals with (n = 11) and without (n = 10) peripheral neuropathy underwent DTI of a defined sciatic nerve segment. Patients and controls were evaluated by clinical examination and nerve conduction studies at baseline and 6 months after the initial DTI scan. The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value was significantly lower in sciatic nerves from patients with peripheral neuropathy as compared with controls. Sciatic nerve FA values correlated with clinical disability scores and electrophysiological parameters of axonal damage at baseline and 6 months after MRI scan. DTI-derived FA values are a sensitive measure to discriminate healthy from functionally impaired human sciatic nerve segments. DTI of proximal nerve segments may be useful for estimating the proximal axonal degeneration burden in patients with peripheral neuropathies. Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - The peripheral nervous system is increasingly being investigated using medical imaging as a complement or in association with electrodiagnostics tests. The application of imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allows detailed visualization of the peripheral nervous system. According to the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, the use of US for nerve evaluation is strongly encouraged. In addition, the role of US is further enhanced by the wide application of US-guided techniques to diagnose or to treat peripheral nerve disorders.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the ultrasound (US) characteristics of peripheral nerves in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and their correlations with electrodiagnostic (EDX) characteristics. Methods: Nineteen patients with CIDP and 19 healthy controls matched by age and body mass index were included in a blind case-control, observational study. All patients underwent a neurologic examination (including inflammatory neuropathy cause and treatment [INCAT] and Medical Research Council [MRC] sum score) and an EDX study. Each patient and each control underwent a US study of 14 nerve segments, yielding a total number of 266 segments scanned in each group. Results: US changes, characterized by an increased nerve cross-sectional area (NCSA), were detected in 53% of the 266 patient nerve segments. Mean NCSA was higher in nerve segments of patients than in those of controls (p < 0.001). Nerve segments with abnormal US belonged to patients with longer disease duration, lower MRC sum score, higher INCAT score, and progressive disease form (all p < 0.0001). All the aforementioned variables were independently associated with the occurrence of US changes. Motor nerve conduction was significantly lower in nerve segments with increased NCSA than in those with normal NCSA (p < 0.0001). NCSA in segments with prevalent myelin damage was higher than that in segments with prevalent axonal damage (p 0.001) or in segments with normal EDX characteristics (p < 0.0001). NCSA and motor nerve conduction velocity were inversely correlated in nerve segments with EDX evidence of myelin damage (R 0.599; p < 0.0001). Conduction blocks were associated with increased NCSA (p 0.001). Conclusions: US may, similar to MRI, have a supporting role in the diagnosis of CIDP. US and EDX changes are correlated. © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Introduction: It has been a challenge to devise non-invasive imaging methods that can visualize axons in peripheral nerves. We have successfully applied MR DTI (Diffusion Tensor Imaging) to visualize nerve fibers in the clinical setting of traumatic nerve injuries and peripheral nerve tumors. Methods: 14 patients underwent MR neurography that included two DTI sequences on a 3T whole body GE DVMR750 system including a full field of view single-shot EPI sequence with 28 diffusion weighted direction-encoded images and a reduced field of view diffusion method with 12 direction-encoded images that uses a 2D echo-planar RF pulse to excite and read out a rectangular-shaped field of view. Additional anatomic images were acquired as part of a routine MR neurogram protocol. Results: MR DTI successfully visualized nerve fibers within the capsule of peripheral nerve tumors. MR DTI also visualized nerve fibers and their absence in traumatized peripheral nerves. Intraoperative visual inspection and electrophysiological testing confirmed the location and relation of nerve fibers to tumors, as well as the presence and absence of nerve fibers in damaged peripheral nerve. Conclusion: MR DTI was used to visualize the relationship of axons to peripheral nerve tumors which can be helpful in the planning of surgical resections. It is also proving useful following traumatic nerve injuries to help determine the extent of axonal injury and may prove useful in determining whether axonal regeneration is occurring which might reduce the necessity for exploratory surgery.

N2  - Introduction: This diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) study aimed to clarify the relationship of peripheral nerves and soft tissue tumors (STTs) in 3D to optimize subsequent treatment. Methods: Twenty-six consecutive STT patients (histologically malignant, n=10; intermediate, n=3; and benign, n=13) underwent 3-Tesla MRI using an echoplanar DTI sequence. Deterministic tractography was performed. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured within peritumoral and distant regions of interest. Results: Tractography depicted the 3D course of the sciatic (n=12), femoral (n=2), tibial (n=7), fibular (n=2), median (n=1), musculocutaneous (n=1), and ulnar (n=1) nerves in a regular (n=8 of 18, 44.4%) or thinned (n=7 of 18, 38.9%) fashion. The lowest peritumoral FA values, abrupt thinning, and/or complete discontinuity of trajectories were found in 2 cases with histologically proven tumoral nerve infiltration. Conclusions: DTI clarifies the 3D topography between major peripheral nerves and STTs and may be helpful in the assessment of peripheral nerve infiltration by malignant tumors. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to establish dynamic
contrast-enhanced perfusion in peripheral nerves for determination of
blood-nerve permeability (K-trans) and nerve blood volume (NBV) in
peripheral neuropathies as compared with healthy controls.
Methods: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee,
and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Forty-three controls (24 women, 19 men; age, 48.7 +/- 17.5 years) and 59
patients with peripheral neuropathy (28 women, 31 men; age, 52.7 +/-
12.4 years) were examined by a standard protocol including a T1-weighted
dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence (time of repetition/time of echo,
4.91/1.64; 10 slices; resolution 0.8 x 0.6 x 3.0 mm(3)). Time - signal
intensity analysis was performed by normalizing to pre-bolus arrival and
calculating the mean contrast uptake (MCU) for each patient. Further
analyses were performed by customized software to calculate K-trans and
NBV. Statistical analysis included 2-sided Student's t tests of controls
versus patients, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and
subgroup analysis of patients according to etiologies of neuropathy.
Results: Time-signal intensity analysis showed significantly increased
contrast uptake in patients as compared with controls (MCU, 1.29 +/-
0.15 vs 1.18 +/- 0.08; P < 0.001). This was caused mainly by an increase
in K-trans (0.046 +/- 0.025 vs 0.026 +/- 0.016 min(-1); P < 0.001) and
less by an increase in NBV (3.9 +/- 2.6 vs 3.0 +/- 1.9 mL/100 mL; P =
0.12). This trend was true for all etiologies except entrapment
neuropathies. Excluding these, receiver operating characteristic
analysis found an area under the curve of 0.78 (95% confidence
interval, 0.69-0.89) for MCU and 0.77 (95% confidence interval,
0.65-0.90) for K-trans to discriminate neuropathy from control.
Conclusions: Dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion is a feasible technique
to assess K-trans and NBV in peripheral nerves and may be used in future
investigations on peripheral neuropathies.

N2  - Objective: To detect and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Method(s): Thirty-six patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing-remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease-modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age-/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. Three Tesla MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2-dimensional (2D) fat-saturated, T2-weighted (T2w) and dual echo turbo spin echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton spin density and T2 relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion. Result(s): T2w hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients, with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5 +/- 5.7 versus 19.1 +/- 2.4 in controls (p < 0.0001). Nerve proton spin density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8 +/- 7.7/368.9 +/- 8.2) versus controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0 +/- 11.0/276.8 +/- 9.7, p < 0.0001). In contrast, T2 relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal: 82.0 +/- 2.1/78.3 +/- 1.7) versus MS (tibial/peroneal: 64.3 +/- 1.0/61.2 +/- 0.9, p < 0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial: 52.4 +/- 2.1mm2, peroneal: 25.4 +/- 1.3mm2) versus controls (tibial: 45.2 +/- 1.4mm2, p < 0.0015; peroneal: 21.3 +/- 0.7mm2, p = 0.0049). Interpretation(s): Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS in vivo by high-resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton spin density and a decrease of T2 relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS.

N2  - Peripheral nerve imaging is recognized as a complement to clinical and  neurophysiological assessment in the evaluation of peripheral nerves with the ability to impact patient management, even for small and difficult nerves. The European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology, suggest to use ultrasound (US) for nerve evaluation due to the fact that, in sever anatomical area, magnetic resonance imaging is not able to give additional informations. US could be considered the first-choice approach for the assessment of peripheral nerves. The relative drawback of peripheral nerve US is the long learning curve and the deep anatomic competence to evaluate even small nerves. In the recent years, the role of US in peripheral nerve evaluation has been widened. In the past, nerve US was mainly used to assess nerve-cross sectional area, but now more advanced measurements and considerations are desirable and can boost the role of peripheral nerve US. Nerve echotexture evaluation was defined in 2010: The ratio between the hypoechoic and hyperechoic areas of peripheral nerves on US was called "nerve density". For evaluation of patients who have peripheral neuropathies, the role of peripheral nerve is US wider than simple cross-sectional area evaluation. Quantitative measurements describing the internal fascicular echotexture of peripheral nerves introduce the concept of considering US as a possible quantitative imaging biomarker technique. The potential of nerve US has started to be uncovered. It seems clear that only cross-sectional area measurement is no more sufficient for a comprehensive US evaluation of peripheral nerves.

N2  - We systematically identified and reviewed 29 studies of peripheral nerve ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRN) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The majority of the ultrasound studies reported smaller nerves and nerve roots in ALS compared to healthy controls, but there was a large overlap of the cross-sectional nerve area between ALS and controls. Most of the MRN studies confirmed nerve abnormalities demonstrating slight T2 hyperintensities and, sometimes, mild enlargement of more proximal nerve segments (plexus, roots) in ALS. The size of the proximal nerve segments, i.e. nerve roots, is thus somewhat incongruent between nerve ultrasound and MRN in ALS. Peripheral nerve ultrasound has the potential to differentiate between ALS and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) in that patients with MMN have significantly larger nerves. Conversely, there is an overlap of MRN abnormalities in ALS and MMN, restricting the techniques’ utility in the clinical setting. A subgroup of patients with ALS seems to reveal a sonographic nerve pattern suggesting peripheral nerve inflammation. In the future, combined imaging with nerve ultrasound and MRN assessing parameters such as blood flow or textural markers may aid in the understanding of the deep nerve microstructure down to the fascicle level, and thus, in the classification of the nerve state as more degenerative or more inflammatory in ALS. This systematic review provides evidence that nerve imaging abnormalities are common in ALS. © 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that measures the extent of restricted water diffusion and anisotropy in biological tissue. Although DTI has been widely applied in the brain, more recently researchers have used it to characterize nerve pathology in the setting of entrapment neuropathy, traumatic injury, and tumor. DTI artifacts are exacerbated when imaging off isocenter in the body. Anecdotally, the most significant artifacts in peripheral nerve DTI include magnetic field inhomogeneity, motion, incomplete fat suppression, aliasing, and distortion. High spatial resolution is also required to reliably evaluate smaller peripheral nerves. This article provides an overview of such technical issues, particularly when trying to apply DTI in the clinical setting, and offers potential solutions. Level of Evidence: 5.

N2  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is increasingly being used in magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). The purpose of this study was to determine the interreader and test-retest reliability of peripheral nerve DTI in MRN with focus on the sciatic nerve. Methods: In this prospective study 27 healthy volunteers each underwent 3 scans of a short DTI protocol on separate days consisting of a T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and single-shot DTI sequence of the sciatic nerve of the dominant leg. The DTI parameters fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were obtained after manual nerve segmentation by two independent readers. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and Bland-Altman plots were calculated as measures for both interreader and test-retest agreement for all readout parameters. Results: The mean ± standard deviation was 0.507 ± 0.05 for FA, 1308.5 ± 162.4 × 10−6 mm2/s for MD, 905.6 ± 145.4 ×10−6 mm2/s for RD and 2114.1 ± 219.2 × 10−6 mm2/s for AD. The SEM for FA was 0.02 for interreader and test-retest agreement, the SEM for MD, RD, and AD ranged between 46.2 × 10−6 mm2/s (RD) and 70.1 × 10−6 mm2/s (AD) for interreader reliability and between 45.9 × 10−6 mm2/s (RD) and 70.1 × 10−6 mm2/s (AD) for test-retest reliability. The ICC for interreader reliability of DTI parameters ranged between 0.81 and 0.92 and ICC for test-retest reliability between 0.76 and 0.91. Conclusion: Peripheral nerve DTI of the sciatic nerve is reliable and reproducible. The measures presented here may serve as first orientation values of measurement accuracy when interpreting parameters of sciatic nerve DTI. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters as in-vivo biomarkers of axon and myelin sheath integrity of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. Methods: MRI examinations at 3T including DTI were conducted on wrists in 30 healthy subjects. After manual segmentation of the median nerve quantitative analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as axial, radial and mean diffusivity (AD, RD, and MD) was carried out. Pairwise Pearson correlations with electrophysiological parameters comprising sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) as markers of axon integrity, and distal motor latency (dml) and sensory nerve conduction velocity (sNCV) as markers of myelin sheath integrity were computed. The significance criterion was set at P=0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. Results: DTI parameters showed a distinct proximal-to-distal profile with FA, MD, and RD extrema coinciding in the center of the carpal tunnel. AD correlated with CMAP (r=0.50, p=0.04, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of myelin sheath integrity. RD correlated with sNCV (r=-0.53, p=0.02, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of axon integrity. FA correlated with dml (r=-0.63, p=0.002, Bonf. corr.) and sNCV (r=0.68, p=0.001, Bonf. corr.) but not with markers of axon integrity. Conclusion: AD reflects axon integrity, while RD (and FA) reflect myelin sheath integrity as validated by correlation with electrophysiology. DTI parameters consistently indicate a slight decrease of structural integrity in the carpal tunnel as a physiological site of median nerve entrapment. DTI is particularly sensitive, since these findings are observed in healthy participants. Our results encourage future studies to evaluate the potential of DTI in differentiating axon from myelin sheath injury in patients with manifest peripheral neuropathies. © 2015 Heckel et al.

N2  - Purpose To determine the reliability and reproducibility of peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in healthy subjects. Materials and Methods We assessed the test-retest and interrater reliability studies of peripheral nerve DTI in a cohort of 12 healthy subjects (mean age 44.0 years, range 26-71 years). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed on a 3T scanner (MR750, GE Healthcare). DTI and T1-weighted sequences were performed on the tibial and peroneal nerves in the knee. Each subject was scanned on three separate occasions. Image analyses were performed at two anatomic positions: the level of the lateral femoral condyle (position 1), and the superior pole of the patella (position 2). Analysis was performed using three software packages ("raters"): FuncTools, FSL, and Diffusion Toolkit. Metrics obtained included fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Results DTI metrics were not significantly different between each measurement position, except peroneal nerve AD and tibial nerve RD were higher at position 1 (P = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). There was no significant difference in DTI metrics between male and female subjects (P = 0.10-0.99). The test-retest reliability of DTI metrics was high, maximal for FA (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96). ICC values for individual DTI metrics were similar between each measurement position, except that tibial nerve AD was significantly higher at position 2 (P = 0.03). Interrater reliability was also high (ICC = 0.95-0.96). Conclusion We found peripheral nerve DTI to be reliable and reproducible, with few effects related to the postprocessing package used.Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Clinical trial design in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains hampered by a lack of reliable and sensitive biomarkers of disease progression. The present study evaluated peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as a surrogate marker of axonal degeneration in ALS. Longitudinal studies were undertaken in 21 ALS patients studied at 0 and 3 months, and 19 patients at 0, 3 and 6 months, with results compared to 13 age-matched controls. Imaging metrics were correlated across a range of functional assessments including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R), lower limb muscle strength (Medical Research Council sum score, MRCSS-LL), compound muscle action potential amplitudes and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Fractional anisotropy was reduced at baseline in ALS patients in the tibial (p < 0.05), and peroneal nerve (p < 0.05). Fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity declined in the tibial nerve between baselines, 3- and 6-month scans (p < 0.01). From a functional perspective, ALSFRS-R correlated with fractional anisotropy values from tibial (R = 0.75, p < 0.001) and peroneal nerves (R = 0.52, p = 0.001). Similarly, peroneal nerve MUNE values correlated with fractional anisotropy values from the tibial (R = 0.48, p = 0.002) and peroneal nerve (R = 0.39, p = 0.01). There were correlations between the change in ALSFRS-R and tibial nerve axial diffusivity (R = 0.38, p = 0.02) and the change in MRCSS-LL and peroneal nerve fractional anisotropy (R = 0.44, p = 0.009). In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that some peripheral nerve DTI metrics are sensitive to axonal degeneration in ALS. Further, that DTI metrics correlated with measures of functional disability, strength and neurophysiological measures of lower motor neuron loss.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic determinants of peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to establish normal values for fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD). METHODS: Sixty subjects were examined at 3 Tesla by single-shot DTI. FA, AD, RD, and MD were collected for the sciatic, tibial, median, ulnar, and radial nerve and were correlated with demographic variables. RESULTS: Mean FA of all nerves declined with increasing age (r = -0.77), which could be explained by RD increasing (r = 0.56) and AD declining (r = -0.40) with age. Moreover, FA was inversely associated with height (r = -0.28), weight (r = -0.38) and BMI (r = -0.35). Although FA tended to be lower in men than women (p = 0.052), this difference became completely negligible after adjustment to body weight. A multiple linear regression model for FA was calculated with age and weight as predictors (defined by backward variable selection), yielding an R 2 = 0.71 and providing a correction formula to adjust FA for age and weight. CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve DTI parameters depend on demographic variables. The most important determinants age and weight should be considered in all studies employing peripheral nerve DTI.

N2  - We examined if MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking could be performed on the sciatic nerve. In 3 healthy volunteers the proximal thigh was examined on a 1.5-Tesla MR-scanner with a 2-channel phased-array coil. Though inherently susceptible to motion, field inhomogeneities, and fast T 2-relaxation of the diffusion imaging technique, the sciatic nerve could be detected and correlated to T2-weighted images in all 3 subjects. Further investigations need to be done to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to see if smaller peripheral nerves than the sciatic nerve can be detected. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The majority of nerve fibers in the spinal cord run longitudinally, playing an important role in connecting the brain to the peripheral nerves. There is a growing interest in applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to the evaluation of spinal cord microarchitecture. The current study sought to compare the organization of longitudinal nerve fibers between healthy and myelopathic spinal cords using entropy-based analysis of principal eigenvector mapping. A total of 22 subjects were recruited, including 14 healthy subjects, seven cervical myelopathy (CM) patients with single-level compression, and one patient suffering from multi-level compression. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (MR) images of the cervical spinal cord were obtained using a pulsed gradient, spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence with a 3T MR system. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually to cover the spinal cord, and Shannon entropy was calculated in principal eigenvector maps. The results revealed no significant differences in orientation entropy values along the whole length of cervical spinal cord in healthy subjects (C2-3: 0.73 +/- 0.05; C3-4: 0.71 +/- 0.07; C4-5: 0.72 +/- 0.048; C5-6: 0.71 +/- 0.07; C6-7: 0.72 +/- 0.07). In contrast, orientation entropy values in myelopathic cord were significantly higher at the compression site (0.91 +/- 0.03), and the adjacent levels (above: 0.85 +/- 0.03; below: 0.83 +/- 0.05). This study provides a novel approach to analyze the orientation information in diffusion MR images of healthy and diseased spinal cord. These results indicate that orientation entropy can be applied to determine the contribution of each compression level to the overall disorganization of principal nerve tracts of myelopathic spinal cord in cases with multi-level compression. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Peripheral nerve conduits were fabricated from biodegradable polyurethane (PU) which was synthesized by a waterborne process. The biodegradable PU was based on poly(ε-caprolactone) diol and polyethylene butylene adipate diol (2:3 molar ratio) as the soft segment. Conduits formed by the freeze-drying process had asymmetric microporous structure. The PU nerve conduits were used to bridge a 10-mm gap in rat sciatic nerve. Nerve regeneration was evaluated by walking track analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrophysiological, and histological analyses. Results demonstrated that after 6 weeks, walking function was recovered by 40%. MR images showed that the transected nerve was reconnected after 3 weeks and the diameter of the regenerated nerve increased from 3 to 6 weeks. The nerve conduction velocity of the regenerated nerve reached 50% of the normal value after 6 weeks. Histological examination revealed that the cross-sectional area of the regenerated nerve at the midconduit was 0.24 mm2 after 6 weeks. The efficacy of PU nerve conduits based on functional recovery and histology was superior to that of commercial conduits (Neurotube). The PU nerve conduit developed in this study may be a potential candidate for clinical peripheral nerve tissue engineering. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - SPG11 belongs to the autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) and presents during childhood or puberty with a complex clinical phenotype encompassing learning difficulties, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, and mental retardation. We hereby present the case of a 30-year-old female patient with complex autosomal recessive HSP with thinning of the corpus callosum (TCC) and dementia that was compound heterozygous with two novel mutations in the SPG11 gene. Sequence analysis of the SPG11 gene revealed two novel mutations in a compound heterozygous state in the index patient (c.2431C>T/p.Gln811Ter and c.6755-6756insT/p.Glu2252Aspfs∗88). MRI showed abnormal TCC, white matter (WM) hyperintensities periventricularly, and the 'ears of the lynx' sign. Diffusion tensor imaging showed a mild-to-moderate decrease in fractional anisotropy and an increase in mean diffusivity in WM compared to age-matched controls, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed abnormal findings in affected WM with a decrease in N-acetyl-aspartate in WM regions of interest. This is the first SPG11 kindred from the Greek population to be reported in the medical literature. © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Purpose: Hinman syndrome is a rare disease with urodynamic findings and a clinical course resembling neuropathic bladder, without a neuropathic etiology. Diffusion tensor imaging is a special technique of magnetic resonance imaging that has recently been used to evaluate the peripheral nerves but has been demonstrated to be applicable for evaluation of the lumbosacral plexus. We examined the lumbosacral plexus using diffusion tensor imaging, which has not previously been reported in patients with Hinman syndrome. Materials and Methods: The study included 12 patients who fulfilled criteria for Hinman syndrome, with severe bladder dysfunction on urodynamics, renal scarring on scintigraphy and no pathological findings on magnetic resonance imaging. The 12 subjects serving as controls required pelvic or spinal magnetic resonance imaging for reasons other than spinal abnormalities. Evaluation was performed with a 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system and 16-channel body coil. Tractography was done to examine the lumbosacral plexus. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were computed and compared between groups for the right and left plexuses. Results: Mean fractional anisotropy was 0.24 and 0.35 for the right plexus in patients and controls, respectively, and 0.24 and 0.36 for the left plexus. Mean diffusivity was 1.39 for the right and left plexuses in patients, and 1.28 for the right and left plexuses in controls (p <0.001 for all). Conclusions: Our study focusing on the lumbosacral plexus as a possible origin of neuropathy revealed abnormal findings in patients with Hinman syndrome resembling nerve injury series. This is the first known study to provide data showing that Hinman syndrome may have a neuropathic etiology. © 2019 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

N2  - Recent developments in the field of peripheral nerve imaging extend the capabilities of imaging modalities to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with peripheral nerve maladies. Methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its derivative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), ultrasound (US) and positron emission tomography (PET) are capable of assessing nerve structure and function following injury and relating the state of the nerve to electrophysiological and histological analysis. Of the imaging methods surveyed here, each offered unique and interesting advantages related to the field. MRI offered the opportunity to visualize immune activity on the injured nerve throughout the course of the regeneration process, and DTI offered numerical characterization of the injury and the ability to develop statistical bases for diagnosing injury. US extends imaging to the treatment phase by enabling more precise analgesic applications following surgery, and PET represents a novel method of assessing nerve injury through analysis of relative metabolism rates in injured and healthy tissue. Exciting new possibilities to enhance and extend the abilities of imaging methods are also discussed, including innovative contrast agents, some of which enable multimodal imaging approaches and present opportunities for treatment application.Copyright © 2015 S.

N2  - Objectives: Widespread sensory deficits occur in 20-40% of chronic pain patients on the side of pain, independent of pain aetiology, and are known as nondermatomal sensory deficits (NDSDs). NDSDs can occur in absence of central or peripheral nervous system lesions. We hypothesised that NDSDs were associated with cerebral grey matter changes in the sensory system and in pain processing regions, detectable with voxel-based morphometry. Method(s): Twenty-five patients with NDSDs, 23 patients without NDSDs ("pain-only"), and 29 healthy controls were studied with high resolution structural MRI of the brain. A comprehensive clinical and psychiatric evaluation based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual was performed in all patients. Result(s): Patients with NDSDs and "pain-only" did not differ concerning demographic data and psychiatric diagnoses, although anxiety scores (HADS-A) were higher in patients with NDSDs. In patients with NDSDs, grey matter increases were found in the right primary sensory cortex, thalamus, and bilaterally in lateral temporal regions and the hippocampus/fusiform gyrus. "Pain-only" patients showed a bilateral grey matter increase in the posterior insula and less pronounced changes in sensorimotor cortex. Conclusion(s): Dysfunctional sensory processing in patients with NDSDs is associated with complex changes in grey matter volume, involving the somatosensory system and temporal regions.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - The need for non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerves that can reliably assess extent of nerve fiber degeneration and regeneration is increasingly realized. Availability of such a technology has several immediate clinical and preclinical applications. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an emerging magnetic resonance based technology that is particularly suited for imaging nerve fiber tracts. This review highlights immediate clinical and preclinical uses of non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerve regeneration and DTI as a potential technology that can fulfill these clinical and research needs. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene at 17q11.2. In 95% of non-founder NF1 patients, NF1 mutations are identifiable by means of a comprehensive mutation analysis. 5-10% of these patients harbour microdeletions encompassing the NF1 gene and its flanking regions. NF1 is characterised by tumours of the peripheral nerve sheaths, the pathognomonic neurofibromas. Considerable inter- and intra-familial variation in expressivity of the disease has been observed which is influenced by genetic modifiers unrelated to the constitutional NF1 mutation. The number of plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) in NF1 patients is a highly heritable genetic trait. Recently, SNP rs2151280 located within the non-coding RNA gene ANRIL at 9p21.3, was identified as being strongly associated with PNF number in a family-based association study. The T-allele of rs2151280, which correlates with reduced ANRIL expression, appears to be associated with higher PNF number. ANRIL directly binds to the SUZ12 protein, an essential component of polycomb repressive complex 2, and is required for SUZ12 occupancy of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B tumour suppressor genes as well as for their epigenetic silencing. Method(s): Here, we explored a potential association of PNF number and PNF volume with SNP rs2151280 in 29 patients with constitutional NF1 microdeletions using the exact Cochran-Armitage test for trends and the exact Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. Both the PNF number and total tumour volume in these 29 NF1 patients were assessed by whole-body MRI. The NF1 microdeletions observed in these 29 patients encompassed the NF1 gene as well as its flanking regions, including the SUZ12 gene. Result(s): In the 29 microdeletion patients investigated, neither the PNF number nor PNF volume was found to be associated with the T-allele of rs2151280. Conclusion(s): Our findings imply that, at least in patients with NF1 microdeletions, PNF susceptibility is not associated with rs2151280. Although somatic inactivation of the NF1 wild-type allele is considered to be the PNF-initiating event in NF1 patients with intragenic mutations and patients with NF1 microdeletions, both patient groups may differ with regard to tumour progression because of the heterozygous constitutional deletion of SUZ12 present only in patients with NF1 microdeletions. © 2012 Musotter et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Technical advances are rapidly changing the clinical and instrumental approach to peripheral nerve diseases. Magnetic resonance neurography, diffusion tensor imaging and nerve ultrasonography are increasingly entering the diagnostic workup of peripheral neuropathies as tools that complement neurophysiology and enable investigation of proximal structures, such as plexuses and roots. Progress in the design of magnetic resonance scanners and sequences, and the development of high-frequency ultrasound probes mean that high-resolution peripheral nerve imaging is possible, enabling detailed examination of nerve size, morphology and internal fascicular structure that can integrate nerve conduction studies into clinical practice. In the growing field of small-fibre neuropathy in which traditional nerve conduction studies are of little or no use, skin biopsy has become a reliable tool for diagnosis. Corneal confocal microscopy nociceptive evoked potentials and microneurography are emerging techniques that are mainly used in clinical research settings, but have increasing relevance to clinical practice. We review these new and emerging techniques and their effects on diagnosis, treatment strategies and prognosis in a variety of peripheral neuropathies, including entrapments, brachial plexopathies, immune and inherited neuropathies, and small-fibre neuropathies. We discuss the most promising research findings and their potential for future application in clinical practice. © 2017 Macmilan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. Al rights reserved.

N2  - The trigeminal nerve and nuclei (the trigeminal complex) are unique in the human body with regard to their anatomical and physiological characteristics. They are also special regarding the lesions in which they are involved, both at the peripheral level because of the susceptibility of some terminal branches, and at the nuclei because of their large size and the large amount of connections with other centers. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging studies are often not sufficiently informative to demonstrate very tiny lesions that could be responsible for an important damage in the brainstem. Therefore, clinical neurophysiology and specifically, the techniques used in the study of the trigeminal functions, remain as convenient diagnostic and research tools to document clinically evident lesions or uncover subclinical abnormalities. This review is focussed on the clinical applicability of the study of trigeminal reflexes, including methods employed in the documentation of focal lesions of peripheral branches, trigeminal involvement of peripheral neuropathies, specific lesions of the trigeminal ganglia, central nervous dysfunctions causing abnormalities in the excitability of trigeminal neurons, and the possible use of trigeminal nerve reflexes in the study of facial pain syndromes and headache. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

N2  - Injury to the central and peripheral nervous systems is an increasingly frequent consequence of standard radiation treatment protocols for tumors involving or adjacent to nervous system structures. Characteristic temporal, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory features distinguish a number of specific radiation injury syndromes, but meticulous and repeated evaluations over time are often required to establish a diagnosis. These syndromes vary with regard to prognosis and therapeutic options, and competing diagnoses with very different natural histories and therapies often mask or mimic the signs and symptoms of radiation-related nervous system injury. The ability to efficiently negotiate this complicated differential diagnostic landscape allows for early diagnosis of tumor recurrence or an alternative etiology, prompt institution of appropriate therapy, avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic studies, and confident prognostication for patients and families. Even after the diagnosis of a radiation-related complication is made, continued vigilance for additional sites or manifestations of radiation injury is mandatory. Meanwhile, further research into treatment, prevention, and the causes of individual susceptibility to radiation injury are essential.

N2  - The neuroimaging of experimental and clinical pain has revolutionised our understanding of the physiological responses to pain and paved the way for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain syndromes. Extensive research on the central mechanisms regarding the sensory-discriminative dimensions of pain have revealed a complex network of cortical and subcortical brain structures involved in the transmission and integration of pain, the so-called pain matrix. Although brain imaging and pharmacological studies have generated some insight into the circuitry that may be involved in the generation of chronic pain symptoms, further research into brain imaging of chronic pain is clearly warranted. However, modern neuroimaging suggests that the chronification of pain (and headaches) involves functional and structural plasticity of both the central and peripheral nervous system. © Springer-VerlagItalia 2007.

N2  - Summary: Mutations in either nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA can result in disruption of oxidative phosphorylation and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial disease manifestations occur predominantly in the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and/or involve several organ systems. The consequences range from manifestations of a single organ or tissues, such as muscle fatigue, if confined only to muscle, seizures, intellectual disabilities, dementia, and stroke (if to the central nervous system), leading to disability or even early death. The definitive diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder can be difficult to establish. Criteria and checklists have been established and are more reflective of adult disease. However, in children, when symptoms suggest a mitochondrial disease, neuroimaging features may have more diagnostic impact and additionally these can be used to follow the course, evolution, and recovery of the disease. This review will demonstrate the common neuroimaging patterns in patients with mitochondrial disorders and point out how various newer neuroimaging modalities may be exploited to glean information as to the different aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction or resulting neurological and cognitive disruption, although reports in the literature using these methods remain sparse. © 2012 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

N2  - Background: Neurologic complications in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been described, but the understanding of their pathophysiologic causes and neuroanatomical correlates remains limited. Purpose: To report on the frequency and type of neuroradiological findings in COVID-19. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, all consecutive adult hospitalized patients with polymerase chain reaction positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and who underwent neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May 24, 2020, were included. All examinations were systematically re-evaluated by 12 readers. Summary descriptive statistics were calculated. Results: A total of 185 patients with COVID-19 (62 years ± 14 [standard deviation]; 138 men) underwent neuroimaging. In total, 222 brain CT, 47 brain MRI, and seven spinal MRI examinations were performed. Intra-axial susceptibility abnormalities were the most common finding (29 of 39; 74%, 95% CI: 58, 87) in patients who underwent brain MRI, often with an ovoid shape suggestive of microvascular pathology and with a predilection for the corpus callosum (23 of 39; 59%; 95% CI: 42, 74) and juxtacortical areas (14 of 39; 36%; 95% CI: 21, 53). Ischemic and macrohemorrhagic manifestations were also observed, but vascular imaging did not demonstrate overt abnormalities. Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 19 patients did not reveal consistent asymmetries between hemispheres or regions. Many patients (18 of 41; 44%; 95% CI: 28, 60) had leukoencephalopathy and one patient had a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum. Other findings included olfactory bulb signal abnormalities (seven of 37; 19%), prominent optic nerve subarachnoid spaces (20 of 36; 56%), and enhancement of the parenchyma (three of 20; 15%), leptomeninges (three of 20; 15%), cranial nerves (two of 20; 10%), and spinal nerves (two of four; 50%). At MRI follow-up, regression of leukoencephalopathy and progressive leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in one patient each, respectively, which is suggestive of dynamic processes. Conclusion: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 had a wide spectrum of vascular and inflammatory involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system. © RSNA, 2020.

N2  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to propose a semiautomated technique to segment and measure the volume of different nerve components of the tibial nerve, such as the nerve fascicles and the epineurium, based on magnetic resonance microneurography and a segmentation tool derived from brain imaging; and to assess the reliability of this method by measuring interobserver and intraobserver agreement. MATERIALS AND METHODS The tibial nerve of 20 healthy volunteers (age range = 23-69; mean = 47; standard deviation = 15) was investigated at the ankle level. High-resolution images were obtained through tailored microneurographic sequences, covering 28 mm of nerve length. Two operators manually segmented the nerve using the in-phase image. This region of interest was used to mask the nerve in the water image, and two-class segmentation was performed to measure the fascicular volume, epineurial volume, nerve volume, and fascicular to nerve volume ratio (FNR). Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were calculated. RESULTS The nerve structure was clearly visualized with distinction of the fascicles and the epineurium. Segmentation provided absolute volumes for nerve volume, fascicular volume, and epineurial volume. The mean FNR resulted in 0.69 with a standard deviation of 0.04 and appeared to be not correlated with age and sex. Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were excellent with alpha values >0.9 for each parameter investigated, with measurements free of systematic errors at the Bland-Altman analysis. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that the method is reproducible and the parameter FNR is a novel feature that may help in the diagnosis of neuropathies detecting changes in volume of the fascicles or the epineurium.

N2  - Rationale: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a great challenge for regenerative medicine. Nerve autograft is the gold standard for clinical PNI repair. Due to its significant drawbacks, artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) have drawn much attention as replacement therapies. We developed a combinatorial NGC consisting of longitudinally aligned electrospun nanofibers and porcine decellularized nerve matrix hydrogel (pDNM gel). The in vivo capacity for facilitating nerve tissue regeneration and functional recovery was evaluated in a rat sciatic nerve defect model. Methods: Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) was electrospun into randomly oriented (PLLA-random) and longitudinally aligned (PLLA-aligned) nanofibers. PLLA-aligned were further coated with pDNM gel at concentrations of 0.25% (PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel) and 1% (PLLA-aligned/1% pDNM gel). Axonal extension and Schwann cells migration were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining of dorsal root ganglia cultured on the scaffolds. To fabricate implantable NGCs, the nanofibrous scaffolds were rolled and covered with an electrospun protection tube. The fabricated NGCs were then implanted into a 5 mm sciatic nerve defect model in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Nerves treated with NGCs were compared to contralateral uninjured nerves (control group), injured but untreated nerves (unstitched group), and autografted nerves. Nerve regeneration was monitored by an established set of assays, including T2 values and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histological assessments, and immunostaining. Nerve functional recovery was evaluated by walking track analysis. Results: PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel scaffold exhibited the best performance in facilitating directed axonal extension and Schwann cells migration in vitro due to the combined effects of the topological cues provided by the aligned nanofibers and the biochemical cues retained in the pDNM gel. Consistent results were obtained in animal experiments with the fabricated NGCs. Both the T2 and fractional anisotropy values of the PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel group were the closest to those of the autografted group, and returned to normal much faster than those of the other NGCs groups. Histological assessment indicated that the implanted PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel NGC resulted in the largest number of axons and the most extensive myelination among all fabricated NGCs. Further, the PLLA-aligned/0.25% pDNM gel group exhibited the highest sciatic nerve function index, which was comparable to that of the autografted group, at 8 weeks post-surgery. Conclusions: NGCs composed of aligned PLLA nanofibers decorated with 0.25% pDNM gel provided both topological and biochemical guidance for directing and promoting axonal extension, nerve fiber myelination, and functional recovery. Moreover, T2-mapping and DTI metrics were found to be useful non-invasive monitoring techniques for PNI treatment. © 2020 The author(s).

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to provide normal reference values for quantitative parameters for brachial and lumbosacral plexi on multimodal MRI. In addition, the parameter variations between the left and right sides, the individual nerve groups, genders and age groups were also evaluated. Material(s) and Method(s): Multimodal MRI was evaluated in 163 healthy subjects, who were randomly divided into three groups: brachial plexus, lumbosacral plexus and diffusion tensor imaging groups. Nerve diameters, contrast ratios, T2 nerve-muscle signal ratios (nT2), fractional anisotropy (FA)values and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC)were measured in both plexi. Parametric tests and Pearson correlation for normally distributed data, and non-parametric tests and Spearman correlation for non-normally distributed data were used. Result(s): There were no significant differences in parameters between the left and right sides. The diameters of the C7, L4-S1, sciatic, and femoral nerve roots were larger in men than in women (P < 0.05). The nT2 in the brachial and lumbosacral plexi and the contrast ratio in the lumbosacral plexus were significantly higher in the elderly. The diameter of the S1 nerve root was smaller in the elderly. There were no significant differences between the individual nerve groups in contrast ratios and in brachial plexus nT2. A gradual increase in the nT2 from the top to the bottom was observed in the L4-S1 nerve roots (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): This study provides multi-parameter normative data for the brachial and lumbosacral plexi while considering differences between the two sides, the individual nerves, genders, and the ages.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objective: To assess the outcomes and safety after CTguided percutaneous sacroplasty in patients with painful sacral insufficiency fractures or pathologic sacral lesions. Methods: A retrospective multicenter analysis of consecutive patients undergoing CT-guided sacroplasty for painful sacral insufficiency fractures or sacral lesions was undertaken. The inclusion criteria consisted of severe sacral pain not responding to conservative medical management with imaging evidence of unilateral or bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures or lesions. Outcome measures included hospitalization status (inpatient or outpatient), pre-treatment and posttreatment visual analog scale (VAS) scores, analgesic use and complications. Patients were followed at approximately 1 month and for at least 1 year after their sacroplasty procedure. Results: Two hundred and forty-three patients were included in the study, 204 with painful sacral insufficiency fractures and 39 with symptomatic sacral lesions. The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.2±1.1 was significantly improved after sacroplasty to 1.9±1.7 in patients with sacral insufficiency fractures (p < 0.001). The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.0±0.9 in patients with sacral lesions was significantly improved after sacroplasty to 2.6±2.4 (p < 0.001). There were no major complications or procedure-related deaths. One patient who was treated for a sacral insufficiency fracture experienced radicular pain due to local extravasation of cement that subsequently required surgical decompression for symptomatic relief. Conclusions: CT-guided percutaneous sacroplasty is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of painful sacral insufficiency fractures or lesions. It is associated with prompt and durable pain relief and should be considered as an effective treatment option in this patient population.

N2  - The underlying factors contributing to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity, a known precursor to skin breakdown in individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM), is likely to involve multiple body systems. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify multi-system factors associated with metatarsophalangeal joint deformity in individuals with type 2 DM and peripheral neuropathy (n = 60). Metatarsophalangeal joint deformity was quantified with a computed tomography (CT) scan. System biomarkers included the musculoskeletal system (foot intrinsic muscle deterioration, tarsal/metatarsal bone mineral density, ankle dorsiflexion, metatarsophalangeal extension movement during a sit to stand task); the vascular system (ankle-brachial index); and the endocrine/immune systems (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, skin intrinsic fluorescence, and hemoglobin A1C). Muscle deterioration (r = 0.27), bone density (r = −0.35), metatarsophalangeal extension movement (r = 0.50), maximum dorsiflexion (r = −0.31), and ankle-brachial index (r = 0.33) were related to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity (p < 0.05). Bone mineral density and metatarsophalangeal extension movement were retained in a regression model relating to deformity (R2 = 0.34). All musculoskeletal system biomarkers and the ankle-brachial index demonstrated weak to moderate relationships to metatarsophalangeal joint deformity. Bone mineral density of the tarsal/metatarsal bones and extending the toes during a sit to stand task were the two strongest factors associated with metatarsophalangeal joint deformity. Evaluation and management of foot bone mineral density and toe extension movement pattern could reduce metatarsophalangeal joint deformity and the risk of skin breakdown and subsequent amputation.

N2  - Repetitive electrical activity produces microstructural alteration in myelinated axons, which may afford the opportunity to noninvasively monitor function of myelinated fibers in peripheral nervous system (PNS)/CNS pathways. Microstructural changes were assessed via two different magnetic-resonance-based approaches: diffusion fMRI and dynamic T2 spectroscopy in the ex vivo perfused bullfrog sciatic nerves. Using this robust, classical model as a platform for testing, we demonstrate that noninvasive diffusion fMRI, based on standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can clearly localize the sites of axonal conduction blockage as might be encountered in neurotrauma or other lesion types. It is also shown that the diffusion fMRI response is graded in proportion to the total number of electrical impulses carried through a given locus. Dynamic T2 spectroscopy of the perfused frog nerves point to an electrical-activity-induced redistribution of tissue water and myelin structural changes. Diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) reveals a reversible shift of tissue water into a restricted isotropic diffusion signal component. Submyelinic vacuoles are observed in electron-microscopy images of tissue fixed during electrical stimulation. A slowing of the compound action potential conduction velocity accompanies repetitive electrical activity. Correlations between electrophysiology and MRI parameters during and immediately after stimulation are presented.

N2  - Objective: To analyse pelvic autonomous innervation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in comparison with anatomical macroscopic dissection on cadavers. Material and methods: Pelvic MRI was performed in eight adult human cadavers (five men and three women) using a total of four sequences each: T1, T1 fat saturation, T2, diffusion weighed. Images were analysed with segmentation software in order to extract nervous tissue. Key height points of the pelvis autonomous innervation were located in every specimen. Standardised pelvis dissections were then performed. Distances between the same key points and the three anatomical references forming a coordinate system were measured on MRIs and dissections. Concordance (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient) between MRI and dissection was calculated. Results: MRI acquisition allowed an adequate visualization of the autonomous innervation. Comparison between 3D MRI images and dissection showed concordant pictures. The statistical analysis showed a mean difference of less than 1 cm between MRI and dissection measures and a correct concordance correlation coefficient on at least two coordinates for each point. Conclusion: Our acquisition and post-processing method demonstrated that MRI is suitable for detection of autonomous pelvic innervations and can offer a preoperative nerve cartography. • Nerve preservation is a hot topic in pelvic surgery • High resolution MRI can show distal peripheral nerves • Anatomo-radiological comparison shows good correlation between MRI and dissection • 3D reconstructions of pelvic innervation were obtained with an original method • This is a first step towards image-guided pelvic surgery. © 2014 European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Perineuroma, rare in children, presents as a painless mononeuropathy of a major nerve trunk. Resection of the lesion with end-to-end sural nerve grafting appears to be the treatment of choice. This technique is not recommended if the unhealthy segment of nerve is too long or if spinal roots are involved. However, in children, reports of direct MR evaluation of nerve trunks and of the exiting nerve roots are limited. We report a 7-year-old girl with an intramural sciatic nerve perineuroma in whom the diagnosis was made by MRI and confirmed by biopsy. The MR protocol combining 3-D T2-W STIR SPACE, fat-saturated gadolinium-enhanced T1-W images, and diffusion tensor imaging with tractography was a valuable tool for depicting peripheral nerve and roots in order to plan surgical treatment. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Background: Diagnosis and disease monitoring of non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN) are based on electrophysiological and clinical measures. However, these methods are insensitive to detect subtle differences of axonal injury. We here assessed the utility of a multiparametric MRI protocol to quantify axonal injury and neurogenic muscle damage in NSVN. Methods: Ten NSVN patients and ten age-matched controls were investigated in this single-center prospective study. All participants were assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the tibial nerve and multiecho Dixon MRI of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. These data were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological data. Results: DTI scans of the tibial nerves of patients with NSVN showed significantly lower mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values (0.32 ± 0.02) compared to healthy controls (0.42 ± 0.01). FA values of NSVN patients correlated negatively with clinical measures of pain. Multiecho Dixon MRI scans revealed significantly higher intramuscular fat fractions in the soleus muscle (19.86 ± 6.18% vs. 5.86 ± 0.74%, p = 0.0015) and gastrocnemius muscle (26.09 ± 6.21% vs. 3.59 ± 0.82%, p = 0.0002) in NSVN patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: Our data provide a proof of concept that MRI can render information about nerve integrity and muscle pathology in NSVN. Further studies are warranted to evaluate DTI and multiecho Dixon MRI as surrogate markers in NSVN. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Seventeen benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors were studied using MR. In all cases T2 relaxation time, signal intensity on Tl-weighted images (lesion/muscle ratio), detectability of nerve of origin, nerve-lesion relationship, and presence of a capsule were assessed. Sixteen tumors showed marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted images with T2 relaxation times values >95 ms. One schwannoma was almost isointense with fat (T2 60 ms). All lesions were isointense with muscle on Tl-weighted images. In schwannomas the nerve was usually situated at the periphery of the lesion and only in one case was it obliterated by the mass. In neurofibromas the nerve was either visible in a central position within the mass (two cases) or no longer visible (five cases). A capsule could be detected in 70% of the schwannomas and in 30% of the neurofibromas. In patients with soft tissue masses, MR may contribute to recognition of nerve sheath tumors by showing the nerve of origin and typical signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. It can also be helpful in distinguishing between schwannomas and neurofibromas by the location of the nerve of origin and the presence of a capsule. © 1991 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

N2  - Purpose: To determine normative morphological and functional magnetic resonance (MR) neurography values in children and adolescents in correlation to demographic determinants. Methods: In this study 29 healthy underage subjects (mean age 13.9 years, range 10–17 years) were examined using a standardized MR neurography protocol of the lumbosacral plexus and the right lower extremity at 3 T. Volumes of the dorsal root ganglia L3–S2, cross-sectional area of the sciatic and tibial nerves, as well as T2-weighted contrast nerve-muscle ratio and quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) values of the sciatic nerve were obtained and correlated with the demographic parameters sex, age, height and weight. Results: While all obtained morphological and functional MR neurography values did not differ between male and female sex, dorsal root ganglia volume, sciatic and tibial nerve cross-sectional area correlated positively with age, height, and weight. The T2-weighted signal of the sciatic nerve was independent of demographic determinants. Negative correlation was found for fractional anisotropy (FA) with age, height, and weight, whereas radial diffusivity (RD) showed a positive correlation only with age. Mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) revealed no correlation with demographic determinants. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that selection of sex-matched controls for further studies assessing peripheral nerve pathologies in underage patients may not be necessary; however, control subjects should be adapted to age, height, and weight of the patient population, especially if assessing dorsal root ganglia volume, nerve cross-sectional area and DTI. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to systematically assess the optimal b-value and reconstruction parameters for DTI and fiber tractography of the median nerve at 3.0 T. Method(s): Local ethical board approved study with 45 healthy volunteers (15 men, 30 women; mean age, 41 +/- 3.4 years) who underwent DTI of the right wrist at 3.0 T. A single-shot echo-planar-imaging sequence (TR/TE 10123/40 ms) was acquired at four different b-values (800, 1000, 1200, and 1400 s/mm2). Two independent readers performed post processing and fiber-tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated. Fiber tracts of the median nerve were generated using four different algorithms containing different FA thresholds and different angulation tolerances. Data were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. Result(s): Tracking algorithms using a minimum FA threshold of 0.2 and a maximum angulation of 10degree were significantly better than other algorithms. Fiber tractography generated significantly longer fibers in DTI acquisitions with higher b-values (1200 and 1400 s/mm2 versus 800 s/mm2; p < 0.001). The overall quality of fiber tractography was best at a b-value of 1200 s/mm 2 (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): In conclusion, our results indicate use of b-values between 1000 and 1400 s/mm2 for DTI of the median nerve at 3.0 T. Optimal reconstruction parameters for fiber tractography should encompass a minimum FA threshold of 0.2 and a maximum angulation tolerance of 10. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - To detect, localize, and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in correlation with clinical and electrophysiologic findings. Methods We prospectively examined 20 patients with AL-polyneuropathy (PNP) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. After detailed neurologic and electrophysiologic testing, the patient group was subdivided into mild and moderate PNP. MRN in a 3.0 tesla scanner with anatomical coverage from the lumbosacral plexus and proximal thigh down to the tibiotalar joint was performed by using T2-weighted and dual-echo 2-dimensional sequences with spectral fat saturation and a 3-dimensional, T2-weighted inversion recovery sequence. Besides evaluation of nerve T2-weighted signal, detailed quantification of nerve injury by morphometric (nerve caliber) and microstructural MRN markers (proton spin density, T2 relaxation time) was conducted. Results Nerve T2-weighted signal increase correlated with disease severity: moderate (420.2 +/- 60.1) vs mild AL-PNP (307.2 +/- 17.9; p = 0.0003) vs controls (207.0 +/- 6.4; p < 0.0001). Proton spin density was also higher in moderate (tibial: 525.5 +/- 53.0; peroneal: 553.6 +/- 64.5; sural: 492.0 +/- 56.6) and mild AL-PNP (tibial: 431.6 +/- 22.0; peroneal: 457.6 +/- 21.7; sural: 404.8 +/- 25.2) vs controls (tibial: 310.5 +/- 14.1; peroneal: 313.6 +/- 11.6; sural: 261.7 +/- 11.0; p < 0.0001 for all nerves). T2 relaxation time was elevated in moderate AL-PNP only (tibial: p = 0.0106; peroneal: p = 0.0070; sural: p = 0.0190). Tibial nerve caliber was higher in moderate (58.0 +/- 8.8 mm 3) vs mild AL-PNP (46.5 +/- 2.5 mm 3; p = 0.008) vs controls (39.1 +/- 1.2 mm 3; p < 0.0001). Conclusions MRN detects and quantifies peripheral nerve injury in AL-PNP in vivo with high sensitivity and in close correlation with the clinical stage. Quantitative parameters are feasible new imaging biomarkers for the detection of early AL-PNP and might help to monitor microstructural nerve tissue changes under treatment.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Purpose: Panoramical radiographs or cone-beam computed tomography (CT) are the standard-of-care in dental imaging to assess teeth, mandible, and mandibular canal pathologies, but do not allow assessment of the inferior alveolar nerve itself nor of its branches. We propose a new technique for “MR neurographic orthopantomograms” exploiting ultrashort echo-time (UTE) imaging of bone and teeth complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography. Materials and Methods: The Institutional Review Board approved the study in 10 healthy volunteers. Imaging of the subjects mandibles at 3.0T (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens-Healthcare) using a 64-channel head coil with isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar reformatting, was performed. Bone images were acquired using a 3D PETRA sequence (TE, 0.07 msec). Morphological nerve imaging was performed using a dedicated 3D PSIF and 3D SPACE STIR sequence. Functional MR neurography was accomplished using a new accelerated diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) prototype sequence (2D SMS-accelerated RESOLVE). Qualitative and quantitative image analysis was performed and descriptive statistics are provided. Results: Image acquisition and subsequent postprocessing into the MR neurographic orthopantomogram by overlay of morphological and functional images were feasible in all 10 volunteers without artifacts. All mandibular bones and mandibular nerves were assessable and considered normal. Fiber tractography with quantitative evaluation of physiological diffusion properties of mandibular nerves yielded the following mean ± SD values: fractional anisotropy, 0.43 ± 0.07; mean diffusivity (mm2/s), 0.0014 ± 0.0002; axial diffusivity, 0.0020 ± 0.0002, and radial diffusivity, 0.0011 ± 0.0001. Conclusion: The proposed technique of MR neurographic orthopantomogram exploiting UTE imaging complemented with high-resolution morphological and functional MR neurography was feasible and allowed comprehensive assessment of osseous texture and neural microarchitecture in a single examination.

N2  - The aim of this study was to assess with MRI morphometric ultrastructural changes in nerves affected by diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). We used an MR micro-neurography imaging protocol and a semiautomated technique of tissue segmentation to visualize and measure the volume of internal nerve components, such as the epineurium and nerve fascicles. The tibial nerves of 16 patients affected by DPN and of 15 healthy volunteers were imaged. Nerves volume (NV), fascicles volume (FV), fascicles to nerve ratio (FNR), and nerves cross-sectional areas (CSA) were obtained. In patients with DPN the NV was increased and the FNR was decreased, as a result of an increase of the epineurium (FNR in diabetic neuropathy 0,665; in controls 0,699, p=0,040). CSA was increased in subjects with DPN (12,84 mm2 versus 10,22 mm2, p=0,003). The FV was increased in patients with moderate to severe DPN. We have demonstrated structural changes occurring in nerves affected by DPN, which otherwise are assessable only with an invasive biopsy. MR micro-neurography appears to be suitable for the study of microscopic changes in tibial nerves of diabetic patients.Copyright © 2017 P. F. Felisaz et al.

N2  - Background Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is diagnosed through
clinical findings and genetic testing. While there are
neurophysiological tools and clinical functional scales in CMT,
objective disease biomarkers that can facilitate in monitoring disease
progression are limited. Purpose To investigate the utility of diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI) in determining the microstructural integrity of
sciatic and peroneal nerves and its correlation with the MRI grading of
muscle atrophy severity and clinical function in CMT as determined by
the CMT neuropathy score (CMTNS). Study Type Prospective case-control.
Subjects Nine CMT patients and nine age-matched controls. Field
Strength/Sequence 3 T T-1-weighted in-/out-of phase spoiled gradient
recalled echo (SPGR) and DTI sequences. Assessment Fractional anisotropy
(FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and mean
diffusivity (MD) values for sciatic and peroneal nerves were obtained
from DTI. Muscle atrophy was graded according to the Goutallier
classification using in-/out-of phase SPGRs. DTI parameters and muscle
atrophy grades were compared between CMT and controls, and the
relationship between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS
were assessed. Statistical Tests The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was used
to compare DTI parameters between CMT and controls. The relationship
between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grades, and CMTNS were analyzed
using the Spearman correlation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analyses of DTI parameters that can differentiate CMT from healthy
controls were done. Results There was a significant reduction in FA and
increase in RD of both nerves (P < 0.05) in CMT, with significant
correlations between FA (negative;P < 0.05) and RD (positive;P < 0.05)
with muscle atrophy grade. In the sciatic nerve, there was significant
correlation between FA and CMTNS (r= -0.795;P < 0.05). FA and RD could
discriminate CMT from controls with high sensitivity (77.8-100%) and
specificity (88.9-100%). Data Conclusion There were significant
differences of DTI parameters between CMT and controls, with significant
correlations between DTI parameters, muscle atrophy grade, and CMTNS.

N2  - Background: There is histological evidence of microstructural changes in the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve in migraineurs. This raises the possibility that altered trigeminal nerve properties contribute to migraine pathophysiology. Whilst it is not possible to explore the anatomy of small trigeminal nerve branches it is possible to explore the anatomy of the trigeminal root entry zone using magnetic resonance imaging in humans. The aim of this investigation is to assess the microstructure of the trigeminal nerve in vivo to determine if nerve alterations occur in individuals with episodic migraine. Methods: In 39 migraineurs and 39 matched controls, T1-weighted anatomical images were used to calculate the volume (mm3) and maximal cross-sectional area of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone; diffusion tensor images were used to calculate fractional anisotropy, mean diffusion, axial diffusion and radial diffusion. Results: There were significant differences between the left and right nerve of controls and migraineurs with respect to volume and not cross-sectional area. Migraineurs displayed reduced axial diffusion in the right nerve compared to the left nerve, and reduced fractional anisotropy in the left nerve compared to left controls. Furthermore, although there were no differences in mean diffusion or radial diffusion, regional analysis of the nerve revealed significantly greater radial diffusion in the middle and rostral portion of the left trigeminal nerve in migraineurs compared with controls. Conclusions: Migraine pathophysiology is associated with microstructural abnormalities within the trigeminal nerve that are consistent with histological evidence of altered myelin and/or organization. These peripheral nerve changes may provide further insight into migraine pathophysiology and enable a greater understanding for targeted treatments of pain alleviation. © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - To investigate the microstructural changes in compressed nerves using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of herniated disc treated with percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy. Diffusion tensor imaging has been widely used to visualize peripheral nerves, and the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed using DTI. However, the microstructural changes after surgery are not well-understood in patients with lumbar disc herniation. Thirty-four consecutive patients with foraminal disc herniation affecting unilateral sacral 1 (S1) nerve roots were enrolled in this study. DTI with tractography was performed on S1 nerve roots before and after surgery. The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient values were calculated from tractography images. In compressed nerve roots, the FA value before surgery was significantly lower than that after surgery (P=0.000). A significant difference in FA values was found between the compressed and normal sides before surgery (P=0.000). However, no significant difference was found between the compressed and normal sides after surgery (P=0.057). A significant difference in apparent diffusion coefficient values was found before and after surgery at the compressed side (P=0.023). However, no significant difference was found between the compressed and normal sides after surgery (P=0.203). We show that the diffusion parameters of compressed nerve roots were not significantly different before and after percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy, indicating that the microstructure of the nerve root recovered after surgery. © 2016 the Author(s).

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely used to visualize peripheral nerves, but the microstructure of compressed nerve roots can be assessed using DTI. However, there are no data regarding the association among microstructural changes evaluated using DTI, the symptoms assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the duration of symptoms after surgery in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Thirty patients with unilateral radiculopathy were investigated using DTI. The changes in the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values as well as the correlation between these changes and the severity and duration of the clinical symptoms were investigated before and at least one month after surgery. The FA values were significantly increased after surgical treatment (p < 0.0001). Both the ADC and ODI values were noticeably decreased (p < 0.0001). A strong positive correlation between the preoperative and postoperative DTI parameters (p < 0.0001) as well as between the preoperative ODI and postoperative ODI/ODI changes (p < 0.0001) were found. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the changes in the DTI parameters and changes in the ODI (p < 0.0001). This preliminary study suggests it may be possible to use DTI to diagnose, quantitatively evaluate and follow-up patients with LDH. © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - Purpose: To examine the possibility of performing high-resolution MRI (microneurography) on peripheral nerves. Materials and Methods: A specific radio frequency (RF) coil was developed to probe the human median nerve at a magnetic field strength of 9.4 T and tested on three excised samples by acquiring microneurograms. Results: The microneurograms revealed neuronal tissue constituents at subfascicular level. The contrast features on proton-density and T1- and T2-weighted images were described and compared. The microscopic water movement was quantified using diffusion weighting parallel and orthogonal to the neuronal fiber orientation. The characteristics of anisotropic diffusion in the median nerve were comparable to those reported from other biological tissues (white matter and kidney). Conclusion: The results overall suggest that microneurography might provide new noninvasive insights into microscopic gross anatomy of the peripheral nerve, injury evaluation, and efficacy of repair, although the feasibility at current clinically relevant field strengths is yet to be determined. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: Due to the lack of understanding of the fascicular organisation, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) leads to unwanted off-target effects. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) can be used to trace fascicles from periphery and image fascicular anatomy. New method: In this study, we present a simple and reproducible method for imaging fascicles in peripheral nerves with iodine staining and microCT for the determination of fascicular anatomy and organisation. Results: At the determined optimal pre-processing steps and scanning parameters, the microCT protocol allowed for segmentation and tracking of fascicles within the nerves. This was achieved after 24 hours and 120 hours of staining with Lugol's solution (1% total iodine) for rat sciatic and pig vagus nerves, respectively, and the following scanning parameters: 4 μm voxel size, 35 kVp energy, 114 μA current, 4 W power, 0.25 fps in 4 s exposure time, 3176 projections and a molybdenum target. Comparison with existing method(s): This optimised method for imaging fascicles provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images and full imaging penetration depth not obtainable with methods typically used such as histology, magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence tomography whilst obviating time-consuming pre-processing methods, the amount of memory required, destruction of the samples and the cost associated with current microCT methods. Conclusion: The optimised microCT protocol facilitates segmentation and tracking of the fascicles within the nerve. The resulting segmentation map of the functional anatomical organisation of the vagus nerve will enable selective VNS ultimately allowing for the avoidance of the off-target effects and improving its therapeutic efficacy. © 2020 The Author(s)

N2  - The emergence of diffusion, structural, and functional neuroimaging methods has enabled major multi-site efforts to map the human connectome, which has heretofore been defined as containing all neural connections in the central nervous system (CNS). However, these efforts are not structured to examine the richness and complexity of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which arguably forms the (neglected) rest of the connectome. Despite increasing interest in an atlas of the spinal cord (SC) and PNS which is simultaneously stereotactic, interactive, electronically dissectible, scalable, population-based and deformable, little attention has thus far been devoted to this task of critical importance. Nevertheless, the atlasing of these complete neural structures is essential for neurosurgical planning, neurological localization, and for mapping those components of the human connectome located outside of the CNS. Here we recommend a modification to the definition of the human connectome to include the SC and PNS, and argue for the creation of an inclusive atlas to complement current efforts to map the brain's human connectome, to enhance clinical education, and to assist progress in neuroscience research. In addition to providing a critical overview of existing neuroimaging techniques, image processing methodologies and algorithmic advances which can be combined for the creation of a full connectome atlas, we outline a blueprint for ultimately mapping the entire human nervous system and, thereby, for filling a critical gap in our scientific knowledge of neural connectivity. © 2020 The Author(s)

N2  - Objective. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the central
nervous system with the rest of the body to regulate many physiological
functions and is therapeutically targeted to treat diseases such as
epilepsy, depression, intestinal dysmotility, chronic pain, and more.
However, we still lack understanding of PNS innervation in most organs
because the large span, diffuse nature, and small terminal nerve bundle
fibers have precluded whole-organism, high resolution mapping of the
PNS. We sought to produce a comprehensive peripheral nerve atlas for use
in future interrogation of neural circuitry and selection of targets for
neuromodulation. Approach. We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance
imaging (DT-MRI) with high-speed compressed sensing to generate a
tractogram of the whole mouse PNS. The tractography generated from the
DT-MRI data is validated using lightsheet microscopy on optically
cleared, antibody stained tissue. Main results. Herein we demonstrate
the first comprehensive PNS tractography in a whole mouse. Using this
technique, we scanned the whole mouse in 28 h and mapped PNS innervation
and fiber network in multiple organs including heart, lung, liver,
kidneys, stomach, intestines, and bladder at 70 mu m resolution. This
whole-body PNS tractography map has provided unparalleled information;
for example, it delineates the innervation along the gastrointestinal
tract by multiple sacral levels and by the vagal nerves. The map enabled
a quantitative tractogram that revealed relative innervation of the
major organs by each vertebral foramen as well as the vagus nerve.
Significance. This novel high-resolution nerve atlas provides a
potential roadmap for future neuromodulation therapies and other
investigations into the neural circuits which drive homeostasis and
disease throughout the body.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate magnetization transfer (MT) effects as a new source of contrast for imaging and tracking of peripheral foot nerves. Materials and Methods: Two sets of 3D spoiled gradient-echo images acquired with and without a saturation pulse were used to generate MT ratio (MTR) maps of 260 μm in-plane resolution for eight volunteers at 3T. Scan parameters were adjusted to minimize signal loss due to T2 dephasing, and a dedicated coil was used to improve the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio of small voxels. Resulting MTR values in foot nerves were compared with those in surrounding muscle tissue. Results: Average MTR values for muscle (45.5 ± 1.4%) and nerve (21.4 ± 3.1%) were significantly different (P < 0.0001). In general, the difference in MTR values was sufficiently large to allow for intensity-based segmentation and tracking of foot nerves in individual subjects. This procedure was termed MT-based 3D visualization. Conclusion: The MTR serves as a new source of contrast for imaging of peripheral foot nerves and provides a means for high spatial resolution tracking of these structures. The proposed methodology is directly applicable on standard clinical MR scanners and could be applied to systemic pathologies, such as diabetes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background and Purpose Magnetization transfer contrast imaging provides indirect information on the concentration of "bound" water protons and their interactions with "free" water molecules. The purpose of this study is to analyze location- and age-dependent changes in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of lower extremity nerves. Materials and Methods Ten younger (20-32 years) and 5 older (50-63 years) healthy volunteers underwent magnetization transfer contrast imaging at 3 Tesla Two 3-dimensional gradient echo sequences with and without an off-resonance saturation pulse (repetition time: 58 milliseconds; echo time: 2.46 milliseconds; band width: 530 Hz/Px; flip angle: alpha = 7degree) were acquired at 3 different locations covering the proximal thigh to the distal lower leg in the group of younger volunteers and at 2 different locations covering the proximal to distal thigh in the group of older volunteers. Sciatic and tibial nerve regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn and additional ROIs were placed in predetermined muscles. Magnetization transfer ratios were extracted from respective ROIs and calculated for each individual and location. Results In young volunteers, mean values of nerve and muscle MTR were not different between the proximal thigh (nerve: 20.34 +/- 0.91; muscle: 31.71 +/- 0.29), distal thigh (nerve: 19.90 +/- 0.98; P = 0.76; muscle: 31.53 +/- 0.69; P = 0.87), and lower leg (nerve: 20.82 +/- 1.07; P = 0.73; muscle: 32.44 +/- 1.11; P = 0.51). An age-dependent decrease of sciatic nerve MTR was observed in the group of older volunteers (16.95 +/- 1.2) compared with the group of younger volunteers (20.12 +/- 0.65; P = 0.019). Differences in muscle MTR were not significant between older (31.01 +/- 0.49) and younger (31.62 +/- 0.37; P = 0.20) volunteers. Conclusion The MTR of lower extremity nerves shows no proximal-to-distal gradient in young healthy volunteers but decreases with age. For future studies using MTR in peripheral nerve disorders, these findings suggest that referencing magnetization transfer contrast values in terms of age, but not anatomical nerve location is required.Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) has been used extensively to study pathological conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, tissue damage is assessed qualitatively with little information regarding the underlying pathophysiological processes involved. Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) is a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging method which is sensitive to tissue macromolecular content and may therefore have an important role in the study of pathologies affecting the PNS. This study explored the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus of healthy volunteers using MRN to identify and segment each lumbar segment (L2–L5) and regions (preganglionic, ganglionic and postganglionic). Reproducibility of the MTR measurements and of the segmentation method were assessed from repeated measurements (scan-rescan), and from the reanalysis of images (intra- and inter-rater assessment), by calculating the coefficient of variation (COV). In all segments combined (L2–L5), mean (± SD) MTR was 30.5 (± 2.4). Scan-rescan, intra- and inter-rater COV values were 3.2%, 4.4% and 5.3%, respectively. One-way analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference in MTR between the preganglionic and postganglionic regions in all lumbar segments. This pilot study in healthy volunteers demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining reliable MTR measurements in the proximal lumbar plexus, opening up the possibility of studying a broad spectrum of neurological conditions in vivo. © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - MR tractography of the lumbosacral plexus (LSP) is challenging due to the difficulty  of acquiring high quality data and accurately estimating the neuronal tracts. We proposed an algorithm for an accurate visualization and assessment of the major LSP bundles using the segmentation of the cauda equina as seed points for the initial starting area for the fiber tracking algorithm.Twenty-six healthy volunteers underwent MRI examinations on a 3T MR scanner using the phased array coils with optimized measurement protocols for diffusion-weighted images and coronal T2 weighted 3D short-term inversion recovery sampling perfection with application optimized contrast using varying flip angle evaluation sequences used for LSP fiber reconstruction and MR neurography (MRN).The fiber bundles reconstruction was optimized in terms of eliminating the muscle fibers contamination using the segmentation of cauda equina, the effects of the normalized quantitative anisotropy (NQA) and angular threshold on reconstruction of the LSP. In this study, the NQA parameter has been used for fiber tracking instead of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the regions of interest positioning was precisely adjusted bilaterally and symmetrically in each individual subject.The diffusion data were processed in individual L3-S2 nerve fibers using the generalized Q-sampling imaging algorithm. Data (mean FA, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity, and normalized quantitative anisotropy) were statistically analyzed using the linear mixed-effects model. The MR neurography was performed in MedINRIA and post-processed using the maximum intensity projection method to demonstrate LSP tracts in multiple planes.FA values significantly decreased towards the sacral region (P < .001); by contrast, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity and NQA values significantly increased towards the sacral region (P < .001).Fiber tractography of the LSP was feasible in all examined subjects and closely corresponded with the nerves visible in the maximum intensity projection images of MR neurography. Usage of NQA instead of FA in the proposed algorithm enabled better separation of muscle and nerve fibers.The presented algorithm yields a high quality reconstruction of the LSP bundles that may be helpful both in research and clinical practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) has hitherto been considered a disease of the peripheral nervous system only, with central nervous system (CNS) involvement largely overlooked. The aim of this study was to investigate any differences in brain structure in subjects with DPN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Thirty-six subjects with type 1 diabetes (No DPN [n = 18], Painful DPN [n = 9], Painless DPN [n = 9]) underwent neurophysiological assessment to quantify the severity of DPN. All subjects, including 18 healthy volunteers (HVs), underwent volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. RESULTS Adjusted peripheral gray matter volume was statistically significantly lower in subjects with painless and painful DPN (mean 599.6 mL [SEM 9.8 mL] and 585.4 mL [10.0 mL], respectively) compared with those with No DPN (626.5 mL [5.7 mL]) and HVs (639.9 mL [7.2 mL]; ANCOVA, P = 0.001). The difference in adjusted peripheral gray matter volume between subjects with No DPN and HVs and those with Painful DPN and Painless DPN was not statistically significant (P = 0.16 and 0.30, respectively). Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed greater localized volume loss in the primary somatosensory cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and cingulate cortex (corrected P > 0.05) in DPN subjects. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to focus on structural changes in the brain associated with DPN. Our findings suggest increased peripheral graymatter volume loss, localized to regions involvedwith somatosensory perception in subjectswith DPN. Thismay have important implications for the long-term prognosis of DPN. © 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - Purpose To establish normal values and to identify demographic determinants of quantitative biomarkers in magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Methods In this study 60 healthy individuals (5 men and 5 women of every decade between 20 and 80 years) were examined according to a standardized MRN protocol at 3 T, including multiecho T2 relaxometry. Nerve cross-sectional area (CSA), transverse relaxation time (T2), and proton spin density (PSD) were assessed for the sciatic, tibial, median, ulnar, and radial nerves. Correlation with demographic variables, such as height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and age was expressed by Pearson coefficients and t‑tests were used to compare MRN biomarkers between men and women with and without normalization to body weight and BMI by linear regression. Results The average nerve CSA correlated moderately with height (r = 0.28, p = 0.04), weight (r = 0.40, p = 0.002), and BMI (r = 0.35, p = 0.008), but not with age (r = 0.23, p = 0.09). While T2 did not correlate with demographic parameters, PSD was strongly inversely associated with BMI (r = −0.64, p < 0.001) and weight (r = −0.557, p < 0.001). Sex-dependent differences in imaging marker values were found for CSA but became negligible after normalization to body weight. Conclusion Quantitative biomarkers of MRN co-vary with demographic variables. As particularly important determinants, we identified body weight for nerve CSA and BMI for PSD. The presented normal values and demographic determinants may assist investigations into the potential of MRN biomarkers in further disease-specific studies.

N2  - Abstract: Magnetic resonance neurography (also called MRN or MR neurography) refers to MR imaging dedicated to the peripheral nerves. It is a technique that enhances selective multiplanar visualisation of the peripheral nerve and pathology by encompassing a combination of two-dimensional, three-dimensional and diffusion imaging pulse sequences. Referring physicians who seek imaging techniques that can depict and diagnose peripheral nerve pathologies superior to conventional MR imaging are driving the demand for MRN. This article reviews the pathophysiology of peripheral nerves in common practice scenarios, technical considerations of MRN, current indications of MRN, normal and abnormal neuromuscular appearances, and imaging pitfalls. Finally, the emerging utility of diffusion-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging is discussed and future directions are highlighted. Key points: • Lesion relationship to neural architecture is more conspicuous on MRN than MRI. • 3D multiplanar imaging technique is essential for pre-surgical planning. • Nerve injuries can be classified on MRN using Sunderland’s classification. • DTI provides quantitative information and insight into intraneural integrity and pathophysiology. © 2017, European Society of Radiology.

N2  - This study evaluates whether diffusion tensor imaging magnetic resonance neurography (DTI-MRN), T2 relaxation time, and proton spin density can detect and grade neuropathic abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 49) were included-11 with severe polyneuropathy (sDPN), 13 with mild polyneuropathy (mDPN), and 25 without polyneuropathy (nDPN)-along with 30 healthy control subjects (HCs). Clinical examinations, nerve conduction studies, and vibratory perception thresholds determined the presence and severity of DPN. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal (tibial nerve) nerve segments of the lower extremity. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated, as were T2 relaxation time and proton spin density obtained from DTI-MRN. All magnetic resonance findings were related to the presence and severity of neuropathy. FA of the sciatic and tibial nerves was lowest in the sDPN group. Corresponding with this, proximal and distal ADCs were highest in patients with sDPN compared with patients with mDPN and nDPN, as well as the HCs. DTI-MRN correlated closely with the severity of neuropathy, demonstrating strong associations with sciatic and tibial nerve findings. Quantitative group differences in proton spin density were also significant, but less pronounced than those for DTI-MRN. In conclusion, DTI-MRN enables detection in peripheral nerves of abnormalities related to DPN, more so than proton spin density or T2 relaxation time. These abnormalities are likely to reflect pathology in sciatic and tibial nerve fibers. © 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - Object. Extraspinal sciatica can present unique challenges in clinical diagnosis and management. In this study, the authors evaluated qualitative and quantitative patterns of sciatica-related pathology at the ischial tuberosity on MR neurography (MRN) studies performed for chronic extraspinal sciatica. Methods. Lumbosacral MRN studies obtained in 14 patients at the University of California, San Francisco between 2007 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients had been referred by neurosurgeons or neurologists for chronic unilateral sciatica (>= 3 months), and the MRN reports described asymmetrical increased T2 signal within the sciatic nerve at the level of the ischial tuberosity. MRN studies were also performed prospectively in 6 healthy volunteers. Sciatic nerve T2 signal intensity (SI) and cross-sectional area at the ischial tuberosity were calculated and compared between the 2 sides in all 20 subjects. The same measurements were also performed at the sciatic notch as an internal reference. Adjacent musculoskeletal pathology was compared between the 2 sides in all subjects. Results. Seven of the 9 patients for whom detailed histories were available had a specific history of injury or trauma near the proximal hamstring preceding the onset of sciatica. Eight of the 14 patients also demonstrated softtissue abnormalities adjacent to the proximal hamstring origin. The remaining 6 had normal muscles, tendons, and marrow in the region of the ischial tuberosity. There was a significant difference in sciatic nerve SI and size between the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides at the level of the ischial tuberosity, with a mean adjusted SI of 1.38 compared with 1.00 (p < 0.001) and a mean cross-sectional nerve area of 0.66 versus 0.54 cm2 (p = 0.002). The control group demonstrated symmetrical adjusted SI and sciatic nerve size. Conclusions. This study suggests that chronic sciatic neuropathy can be seen at the ischial tuberosity in the setting of prior proximal hamstring tendon injury or adjacent soft-tissue abnormalities. Because hamstring tendon injury as a cause of chronic sciatica remains a diagnosis of exclusion, this distinct category of patients has not been described in the radiographic literature and merits special attention from clinicians and radiologists in the management of extraspinal sciatica. Magnetic resonance neurography is useful for evaluating chronic sciatic neuropathy both qualitatively and quantitatively, particularly in patients for whom electromyography and traditional MRI studies are unrevealing. ©AANS, 2014.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Methods were invented that made it possible to image peripheral nerves in the body and to image neural tracts in the brain. The history, physical basis, and dyadic tensor concept underlying the methods are reviewed. Over a 15-year period, these techniques - magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and diffusion tensor imaging - were deployed in the clinical and research community in more than 2500 published research reports and applied to approximately 50 000 patients. Within this group, approximately 5000 patients having MRN were carefully tracked on a prospective basis. METHOD(S): A uniform Neurography imaging methodology was applied in the study group, and all images were reviewed and registered by referral source, clinical indication, efficacy of imaging, and quality. Various classes of image findings were identified and subjected to a variety of small targeted prospective outcome studies. Those findings demonstrated to be clinically significant were then tracked in the larger clinical volume data set. RESULT(S): MRN demonstrates mechanical distortion of nerves, hyperintensity consistent with nerve irritation, nerve swelling, discontinuity, relations of nerves to masses, and image features revealing distortion of nerves at entrapment points. These findings are often clinically relevant and warrant full consideration in the diagnostic process. They result in specific pathological diagnoses that are comparable to electrodiagnostic testing in clinical efficacy. A review of clinical outcome studies with diffusion tensor imaging also shows convincing utility. CONCLUSION(S): MRN and diffusion tensor imaging neural tract imaging have been validated as indispensable clinical diagnostic methods that provide reliable anatomic pathological information. There is no alternative diagnostic method in many situations. With the elapsing of 15 years, tens of thousands of imaging studies, and thousands of publications, these methods should no longer be considered experimental.

N2  - Introduction: Investigation of peripheral neuropathies by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) may provide increased diagnostic accuracy when performed in combination with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This study seeks to evaluate DTI in the detection of neuropathic abnormalities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A). Methods: MRI of the sciatic and tibial nerves, including MRN and DTI, was prospectively performed in 15 CMT1A patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs). The following MRI parameters were evaluated and correlated with clinical and neurophysiological findings: T2-relaxation time, proton spin density (PD) and DTI (fractional anisotropy [FA] and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]). Results: DTI showed lower FA and higher ADC in CMT1A compared with HCs. T2 relaxation time showed no difference; however, PD of the sciatic nerve was higher in CMT1A. There were some close associations between neuropathy severity and MRN-DTI, with the closest correlation between FA and nerve conduction velocity in the sciatic nerve (r = 0.76, P < 0.01). Discussion: MRN-DTI evaluation of sciatic and tibial nerves improves the detection of nerve abnormalities in patients with CMT1A. Muscle Nerve 56: E78–E84, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Objective: In this study we investigated the potential value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in characterizing changes in the cervical spinal cord and peripheral nerve roots in vivo in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Methods: We developed an MRI protocol with 4 sequences to investigate the cervical spinal cord and nerve roots on a 3 Tesla MRI system. We used 2 anatomical MRI sequences to investigate cross-sectional area (CSA) at each spinal segment and the diameter of ventral and dorsal nerve roots, and two diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques to estimate the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in 10 SMA patients and 20 healthy controls. Results: There were no significant differences in CSA (p > .1), although an 8.5% reduction of CSA in patients compared to healthy controls was apparent at segment C7. DTI data showed a higher AD in grey matter of patients compared to healthy controls (p = .033). Significantly lower MD, AD and RD values were found in rostral nerve roots (C3-C5) in patients (p < .045). Conclusions: We showed feasibility of an advanced 3 T MRI protocol that allowed differences to be determined between patients and healthy controls, confirming the potential of this technique to assess pathological mechanisms in SMA. After further development and confirmation of findings in a larger sample, these techniques may be used to study disease course of SMA in vivo and evaluate response to survival motor neuron (SMN) augmenting therapy. © 2019

N2  - Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent imaging modality for soft tissues. Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging is an MRI technique that is sensitive to the bound protons of macromolecules and therefore can aid in the assessment of nerve damage. Methods: Measurements of the MT ratio (MTR), which provides an index of the MT effects in tissues, were performed in the wrist and foot of 5 volunteers. Results: The MTR of foot (interdigital) nerves (22.2 ± 2.1%) was smaller than that of the median nerve (41.1 ± 1.4%). No difference was observed between MTR in muscles adjacent to foot nerves (46.0 ± 1.5%) and muscles adjacent to the median nerve (44.2 ± 1.9%). Conclusions: In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the MTR of foot nerves. The difference of MTR between median and foot nerves indicates a difference in structure/composition. The MTR of peripheral nerves may serve as a biomarker of nerve damage, collagen integrity, and demyelination. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - The ability to measure myelin in vivo has great consequences for furthering our knowledge of normal development, as well as for understanding a wide range of neurological disorders. The following review summarizes the current state of myelin imaging using MR. We consider five MR techniques that have been used to study myelin: 1) conventional MR, 2) MR spectroscopy, 3) diffusion, 4) magnetization transfer, and 5) T2 relaxation. Fundamental studies involving peripheral nerve and MR/histology comparisons have aided in the interpretation and validation of MR data. We highlight a number of important findings related to myelin development, damage, and repair, and we conclude with a critical summary of the current techniques available and their potential to image myelin in vivo. © 2007 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To describe a new semiautomated method for segmenting and measuring the volume of the muscle, bone, and adipose (subcutaneous and intermuscular) tissue in calf muscle compartments using magnetic resonance (MR) images and determine the intrarater and interrater reproducibility of the measures. Materials and Methods: Proton-density weighted MR images were acquired from the right calf of 21 subjects. Three raters segmented and measured the volumes of bones, adipose tissue, and five individual muscle compartments. Two raters repeated the segmentations. The intra- and interrater reproducibility of the measures (intraclass correlation coefficients; ICC) were determined using generalizability theory. Results: All ICC values were greater than 0.96. The average standard error of the mean (SEM) of all measures was 1.21 cm3 and none were greater than 2.3 cm3. Essentially all variation (≥97% for all measures) was due to subject differences, indicating low error in the measurements. Conclusion: The volumetric measurements for the bones, adipose tissue, and muscle in each of the compartments using MRI were highly reproducible. MRI can provide quantitative, reproducible volumetric measures of bone, adipose tissue, and individual muscle compartments in the calf. We believe these methods can be used to quantify specific muscle or adipose volumetric measures for other clinical or research purposes. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Assessment of myelin integrity in peripheral nerve injuries and pathologies has largely been limited to post-mortem analysis owing to the difficulty in obtaining biopsies without affecting nerve function. This is further encumbered by the small size of the tissue and its location. Therefore, the development of robust, non-invasive methods is highly attractive. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, including magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), to longitudinally and non-invasively characterize both the sciatic nerve crush and lysolecithin (LCP) demyelination models of peripheral nerve injury in rodents. Electrophysiological, gene expression and histological assessments complemented the extensive MRI analyses in young and aged animals. In the nerve crush model, MTR analysis indicated a slower recovery in regions distal to the site of injury in aged animals, as well as incomplete recovery at six weeks post-crush when analyzing across the entire nerve surface. Similar regional impairments were also found in the LCP demyelination model. This research underlines the power of MTR for the study of peripheral nerve injury in small tissues such as the sciatic nerve of rodents and contributes new knowledge to the effect of aging on recovery after injury. A particular advantage of the approach is the translational potential to human neuropathies.

N2  - Measurements of T2 relaxation times in tissues have provided a unique, noninvasive method to investigate the microenvironment of water molecules in vivo. As more clinical imaging is performed at higher field strengths, tissue relaxation times need to be reassessed in order to optimize tissue contrast. The purpose of this study was to investigate the water proton T2 relaxation time in human median nerve at 7 T. High-resolution images of the wrist were obtained using a home-built dedicated microstrip coil. Gradient echo images provided a good anatomical delineation of the wrist structure, with a clear definition of the median nerve, tendons, bone, and connective tissue within the wrist in an acquisition time of 2 min. Measurements of the T2 relaxation time were performed with a spin echo imaging sequence. The T2 relaxation time of the median nerve was 18.3 ± 1.9 ms, which is significantly shorter than the T2 measured in previous studies performed at 1.5 T and 3 T. Further, the T2 relaxation time of the median nerve is shorter than the T2 relaxation time of other tissues, such as brain tissue, at the same field strength. Since the T2 relaxation time of water protons is sensitive to the water microenvironment, relaxation measurements and, in general, a more quantitative magnetic resonance imaging approach might help in detecting and investigating diseases of peripheral nervous system, such as compressive and inflammatory neuropathies, in humans. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: The majority of growing and/or symptomatic peripheral nerve tumors are schwannomas and neurofibromas. They are almost always benign and can usually be fully surgically resected while sparing motor and sensory function if approached with the proper expertise and techniques. Intraoperative electrophysiological stimulation and recording techniques allow the surgeon to map the surface of the tumor in an effort to identify and thereby avoid damaging functioning nerve fibers. Recently, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MR DTI) techniques have permitted the visualization of axons, due to their anisotropic properties, in peripheral nerves. Methods: MR DTI data and intraoperative data were collected prospectively for seven patients with peripheral nerve tumors that were surgically resected. We compared preoperative identification of nerve fiber location in relation to the surface of the nerve tumor as seen on MR DTI studies with their intraoperative localization using electrophysiological stimulation and recordings. Results: We found good correlation between nerve fiber location seen on MR DTI and anatomic nerve fiber location seen intraoperatively. MR DTI demonstrated 85.7% sensitivity, 92.9% specificity, 92% positive predictive value and 87% negative predictive value in determining the relationship of nerve fibers relative to the tumor. Conclusions: We conclude that preoperative MR DTI techniques are extremely reliable as an imaging modality and are very useful in helping the peripheral nerve surgeon to both determine the risks involved in resecting a nerve tumor as well as in planning the safest surgical approach.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate 22 histologically proven peripheral nerve sheath tumors, approximately two-thirds of which arose in the lower extremity. The histologic distribution was as follows: 12 schwannomas, 7 neurofibromas, and 3 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (2 of which occurred in patients with neurofibromatosis). Most lesions demonstrated an intermediate to moderately bright signal on T1-weighted images and were minimally inhomogeneous. All lesions were moderately bright on proton-density-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images, again with variable inhomogeneity. The extent of the tumor was best assessed on proton-density- and T2-weighted images. Smooth margins were noted in 19 lesions. Of the 3 remaining lesions, 2 were malignant (but had been subjected to biopsy prior to MRI), and the other lesion was a plexiform neurofibroma. MRI accurately determined the relationship between the lesion and the adjacent neurovascular structures and muscles, thereby assisting surgical management. On MRI, 5 lesions demonstrated coexistent subtle muscle atrophy along the longitudinal axis of surrounding or distally innervated musculature. This latter finding, together with the presence of a tumor in the vicinity of a large nerve trunk, suggests a peripheral nerve sheath neoplasm. © 1991 International Skeletal Society.

N2  - Aims/hypothesis: Longstanding diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the risk of complications affecting the central nervous system. The aims were to study brain volume and cortical thickness in regional brain areas in DM patients and to correlate the findings with relevant clinical data. Methods: 15 patients with longstanding (average 24.6 years) type 1 DM and 20 healthy controls were studied in a 3T magnetic resonance scanner. Using an automated surface based cortical segmentation method, cortical thickness was assessed in anatomical regions including total and lobe-wise grey and white matter volumes. Also morphological changes were evaluated. Results: No differences between patients and controls were found in regard to number of white matter lesions (P=0.50), grey and white matter volumes (P=0.25) and overall cortical thickness (P=0.64). Subanalysis revealed exclusively reduced cortical thickness of the postcentral (P=0.03) and superior parietal gyrus (P=0.008) in patients. The cortical thickness of these regions was not associated with diabetes duration, age at diabetes onset or to HbA1c (all P>0.08). Patients with peripheral neuropathy showed reduced right postcentral gyrus cortical thickness compared to patients without peripheral neuropathy (P=0.02). Conclusions: Patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed cortical thinning involving sensory related areas, even though no overall macrostructural brain alterations were detected. This could possibly have underlying functional significance since cortical thinning was associated to presence of peripheral neuropathy. The absence of universal macrostructural changes might illustrate that more pronounced brain pathology is likely to be preceded by more subtle microstructural changes as reported in other studies. © J.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of magnetic resonance (MR) neurography in children, and the potential roles of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fiber-tracking (FT) techniques. Methods: Five pediatric patients (age range: 6-12 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for various clinical indications: neurogenic bladder (case 1); persistent hand pain following minor trauma (case 2); progressive atrophy of the lower left extremity muscles (case 3); bilateral hip pain (case 4); and palpable left supraclavicular mass (case 5). All studies were performed using a 1.5-T Avanto MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The protocol included 3D T2-weighted STIR and SPACE imaging, T1-weighted fat-saturation post-gadolinium imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tractography. ADC (N×10-3 mm2/s) and FA values were calculated from regions of interest (ROIs) centered on the nerves. Nerve-fiber tracks were calculated using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (NeuroD software). Results: MR neurography allowed satisfactory visualization of all neural structures, and FA and ADC measurements were feasible. The final diagnoses were Tarlov cysts, median-nerve compression, sciatic perineurioma, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and plexiform neurofibroma in a patient with NF-1. Discussion: FA and ADC measurements are of little value because of the lack of normal reference values. Nerve-fiber tractography (FT) may be of value in the characterization of tumor pathology, and is also helpful in the planning of surgical treatments. Conclusion: MR neurography is feasible in pediatric patients. However, a considerable amount of work has yet to be done to establish its role in the clinical management of the wide range of peripheral nerve diseases. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Introduction: Spinal cord and peripheral nerves are classically known to be damaged in Friedreich's ataxia, but the extent of cerebral involvement in the disease and its progression over time are not yet characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate longitudinally cerebral damage in Friedreich's ataxia Methods: We enrolled 31 patients and 40 controls, which were evaluated at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. To assess gray matter, we employed voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness measurements. White matter was evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging. Statistical analyses were both cross-sectional and longitudinal (corrected for multiple comparisons). Results: Group comparison between patients and controls revealed widespread macrostructural differences at baseline: gray matter atrophy in the dentate nuclei, brainstem, and precentral gyri; and white matter atrophy in the cerebellum and superior cerebellar peduncles, brainstem, and periventricular areas. We did not identify any longitudinal volumetric change over time. There were extensive microstructural alterations, including superior cerebellar peduncles, corpus callosum, and pyramidal tracts. Longitudinal analyses identified progressive microstructural abnormalities at the corpus callosum, pyramidal tracts, and superior cerebellar peduncles after 1 year of follow-up. Conclusion: Patients with Friedreich's ataxia present more widespread gray and white matter damage than previously reported, including not only infratentorial areas, but also supratentorial structures. Furthermore, patients with Friedreich's ataxia have progressive microstructural abnormalities amenable to detection in a short-term follow-up. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

N2  - Volumetric image segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) encounters several challenges, which are specific to medical images. Among these challenges are large volumes of interest, high class imbalances, and difficulties in learning shape representations. To tackle these challenges, we propose to improve over traditional CNN-based volumetric image segmentation through point-wise classification of point clouds. The sparsity of point clouds allows processing of entire image volumes, balancing highly imbalanced segmentation problems, and explicitly learning an anatomical shape. We build upon PointCNN, a neural network proposed to process point clouds, and propose here to jointly encode shape and volumetric information within the point cloud in a compact and computationally effective manner. We demonstrate how this approach can then be used to refine CNN-based segmentation, which yields significantly improved results in our experiments on the difficult task of peripheral nerve segmentation from magnetic resonance neurography images. By synthetic experiments, we further show the capability of our approach in learning an explicit anatomical shape representation. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate large coverage magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In this prospective study, 18 patients with CIDP and 18 healthy controls were examined by a standardized MRN protocol at 3 T. Lumbosacral plexus was imaged by a T2-weighted 3D sequence and peripheral nerves of the upper and lower extremity by axial T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences. Lesions were characterized by nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) and T2-weighted signal (nT2). Additionally, T2 relaxometry of the sciatic nerve was performed using a multi-spin-echo sequence. All patients received a complementary electrophysiological exam. Patients with CIDP exhibited increased nerve CSA and nT2 compared to controls (p < 0.05) in a proximally predominating pattern. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed the best diagnostic accuracy for CSA of the lumbosacral plexus (AUC = 0.88) and nT2 of the sciatic nerve (AUC = 0.88). CSA correlated with multiple electrophysiological parameters of demyelinating neuropathy (F wave latency, nerve conduction velocity) of sciatic and median nerve, while nT2 only correlated with F wave latency of sciatic and not median nerve. T2 relaxometry indicated that MR signal increase in CIDP was due to an increase in proton-spin-density (p < 0.05), and not due to the increase in T2 relaxation time. Both nT2 and CSA might aid in the diagnosis of CIDP, but CSA correlates more robustly with established electrophysiological parameters for CIDP. Since the best diagnostic accuracy was shown for proximal nerve locations, MRN may be a useful complementary tool in selected CIDP cases.

N2  - Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that occur commonly in individuals with neurocutaneous disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1. Vagal nerve neurofibromas, however, are a relatively rare occurrence.We present the case of a 22-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with a neurofibroma of the left cervical vagal nerve. The mass was resected through an anterior approach without major event. In the postoperative course, the patient developed left vocal cord paralysis treated with medialization with injectable gel. We then present a comprehensive review of the literature for surgical resection of vagal nerve neurofibromas.Copyright © 2016 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

N2  - Purpose: To perform in vivo isotropic-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of lumbosacral and sciatic nerves with a phase-navigated diffusion-prepared (DP) 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) acquisition and modified reconstruction incorporating intershot phase-error correction and to investigate the improvement on image quality and diffusion quantification with the proposed phase correction. Methods: Phase-navigated DP 3D TSE included magnitude stabilizers to minimize motion and eddy-current effects on the signal magnitude. Phase navigation of motion-induced phase errors was introduced before readout in 3D TSE. DTI of lower back nerves was performed in vivo using 3D TSE and single-shot echo planar imaging (ss-EPI) in 13 subjects. Diffusion data were phase-corrected per kz plane with respect to T2-weighted data. The effects of motion-induced phase errors on DTI quantification was assessed for 3D TSE and compared with ss-EPI. Results: Non–phase-corrected 3D TSE resulted in artifacts in diffusion-weighted images and overestimated DTI parameters in the sciatic nerve (mean diffusivity [MD] = 2.06 ± 0.45). Phase correction of 3D TSE DTI data resulted in reductions in all DTI parameters (MD = 1.73 ± 0.26) of statistical significance (P ≤ 0.001) and in closer agreement with ss-EPI DTI parameters (MD = 1.62 ± 0.21). Conclusion: DP 3D TSE with phase correction allows distortion-free isotropic diffusion imaging of lower back nerves with robustness to motion-induced artifacts and DTI quantification errors.

N2  - The diagnostic workup and surgical therapy for peripheral nerve tumors and tumorlike lesions are challenging. Magnetic resonance imaging is the standard diagnostic tool in the preoperative workup. However, even with advanced pulse sequences such as diffusion tensor imaging for MR neurography, the ability to differentiate tumor entities based on histological features remains limited. In particular, rare tumor entities different from schwannomas and neurofibromas are difficult to anticipate before surgical exploration and histological confirmation. High-resolution ultrasound (HRU) has become another important tool in the preoperative evaluation of peripheral nerves. Ongoing software and technical developments with transducers of up to 17-18 MHz enable high spatial resolution with tissue-differentiating properties. Unfortunately, high-frequency ultrasound provides low tissue penetration. The authors developed a setting in which intraoperative HRU was used and in which the direct sterile contact between the ultrasound transducer and the surgically exposed nerve pathology was enabled to increase structural resolution and contrast. In a case-guided fashion, the authors report the sonographic characteristics of rare tumor entities shown by intraoperative HRU and contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

N2  - Background We imaged the corticospinal tract (CST) and corticoreticular
pathway (CRP) using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) to evaluate the
cause of muscle weakness in a patient who was exposed to high-voltage
electricity. Case presentation A 39-year-old man presented with
quadriparesis after high-voltage electrical shock from power lines while
working about 5.8 years ago. The electrical current entered through the
left hand and exited through the occipital area of the head. The degree
of weakness on bilateral upper and lower extremities was 3-4 on the
Medical Research Council strength scale. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
was performed 5.8 years after onset. The CST and CRP were depicted by
placing two regions of interest for each neural tract on the
two-dimensional fractional anisotropy color map. DTT of the DTI scan
showed that the bilateral CST and CRP were thinned compared to those of
the healthy control subject. On the nerve conduction test, abnormal
findings suggesting peripheral nerve lesion were not observed.
Therefore, injury of bilateral CST and CRP seems to have contributed to
our patient's weakness after the electrical shock. Conclusion Depiction
of neural tracts in the brain using DTT can assist in the accurate and
detailed evaluation of the cause of neural deficit after electrical
injury.

N2  - Objective: Management of peripheral nerve injuries requires physicians to rely on qualitative measures from patient history, electromyography, and physical exam. Determining a successful nerve repair can take months to years for proximal injuries, and the resulting delays in clinical decision-making can lead to a negative impact on patient outcomes. Early identification of a failed nerve repair could prevent permanent muscle atrophy and loss of function. This study aims to test the feasibility of performing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate injury and recovery following repair of wrist trauma. We hypothesize that DTI provides a noninvasive and reliable assessment of regeneration, which may improve clinical decision-making and alter the clinical course of surgical interventions. Methods: Clinical and MRI measurements from subjects with traumatic peripheral nerve injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, and healthy control subjects were compared to evaluate the relationship between DTI metrics and injury severity. Results: Fractional anisotropy from DTI was sensitive to differences between damaged and healthy nerves, damaged and compressed nerves, and injured and healthy contralateral nerves. Longitudinal measurements in two injury subjects also related to clinical outcomes. Implications of other diffusion measures are also discussed. Interpretation: DTI is a sensitive tool for wrist nerve injuries and can be utilized for monitoring nerve recovery. Across three subjects with nerve injuries, this study has shown how DTI can detect abnormalities between injured and healthy nerves, measure recovery, and determine if re-operation was successful. Additional comparisons to carpal tunnel syndrome and healthy nerves show that DTI is sensitive to the degree of impairment. © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - The in vivo assessment of axonal projections of the peripheral nervous system has been severely limited by the lack of noninvasive techniques. We examined whether MR diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking of the human median nerve is feasible. The median nerve was examined with a 3-T MRI scanner in wrists of three healthy volunteers and the wrist of a patient after median nerve repair. In vivo three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of axonal projections of the median nerve could be achieved in healthy volunteers with intact median nerves and a patient with a transected median nerve using diffusion tensor imaging combined with fiber tracking. The median nerve could be visualized and correlated well to the expected location on T1-weighted images in the patient and all volunteers. The transected median nerve in the patient could be detected up to the site of repair one month postoperatively, whereas the nerve could not be detected more distally immediately after repair. Two months postoperatively, it could clearly be tracked more distally, indicating nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging can detect the median nerve in healthy individuals as well as up to the lesion site in a patient with a complete transection of the median nerve. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used in the study of the central nervous system. DTI represents a potential diagnostic tool for the peripheral nerve. However, more detailed information is needed for application of DTI in the clinical setting. In this study, peripheral degeneration and regeneration were evaluated using DTI-based analyses in a rabbit model. The changes in DTI parameters were compared to histological and functional changes after nerve injury. We used a high magnetic field (7.04T) MRI system. Japanese white male rabbits were used as the model of sciatic nerve crush injury. MR images were obtained before injury and at 2, 4, 6 and 8weeks post-injury. The DTI parameters of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (lambda ), and radial diffusivity (lambda) were calculated. Our results showed decreased FA and increased lambda during the degenerative phase after sciatic nerve injury. In contrast, increased FA and decreased lambda were observed during the regenerative phase. FA changes were correlated with axon number and with motor function recovery, assessed with the toe-spreading index. This study clearly demonstrates the validity of applying DTI parameters to the in vivo evaluation of peripheral nerve regeneration. Furthermore, results suggest that DTI can be a potent tool for predicting the extent of functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Peripheral nerve injuries result in severe loss of sensory and motor functions in the afflicted limb. There is a lack of standardised models to non-invasively study degeneration, regeneration, and normalisation of neuronal microstructure in peripheral nerves. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive evaluation of peripheral nerve injuries, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and tractography on a rat model of sciatic nerve injury. 10 female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to sciatic nerve neurotmesis and studied using a 9.4T magnet, by performing DTI and DKI of the sciatic nerve before and 4 weeks after injury. The distal nerve stump showed a decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis (MK), axonal water fraction (AWF), and radial and axonal kurtosis (RK, AK) after injury. The proximal stump showed a significant decrease in axial diffusivity (AD) and increase of MK and AK as compared with the uninjured nerve. Both mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) increased in the distal stump after injury. Tractography visualised the sciatic nerve and the site of injury, as well as local variations of the diffusion parameters following injury. In summary, the described method detects changes both proximal and distal to the nerve injury.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in assessing peripheral nerve regeneration in vivo. We assessed the changes in the DTI parameters and histological analyses after nerve injury to examine degeneration and regeneration in the rat sciatic nerves. Materials and Methods: For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 16 rats were randomly divided into two groups: group P (permanently crushed; n = 7) and group T (temporally crushed; n = 9). Serial MRI of the right leg was performed before the operation, and then performed at the timepoints of 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the crush injury. The changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (λ ∥), and radial diffusivity (λ⊥) were quantified. For histological analyses, the number of axons and the myelinated axon areas were quantified. Results: Decreased FA and increased λ⊥ were observed in the degenerative phase, and increased FA and decreased λ⊥ were observed in the regenerative phase. The changes in FA and λ⊥ were strongly correlated with histological changes, including axonal and myelin regeneration. Conclusion: DTI parameters, especially λ⊥, can be good indicators for peripheral nerve regeneration and can be applied as noninvasive diagnostic tools for a variety of neurological diseases. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The genetic component of multiple sclerosis (MS) is now set to 200  autosomal common variants. However, it is unclear how genetic knowledge be clinically used in the differential diagnosis between MS and other inflammatory conditions like adult-onset postinfectious neurological syndromes (PINS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether PINS and MS have a shared genetic background using an updated polygenic risk scores. METHODS: Eighty-eight PINS patients have been consecutively recruited between 1996 and 2016 at Mondino Foundation of Pavia, diagnosed according to clinical, MRI and CSF findings and followed-up for several years. Patients were typed using Illumina array, and genotypes imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. A weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) has been calculated based on autosomal MS risk loci derived from large-scale studies, and an HLA genetic burden (HLAGB) was also calculated on loci associated to MS. RESULTS: PINS occurred as an episode of myelitis in 44% of patients, encephalomyelitis in 44%, and encephalitis in remaining cases, with an involvement of peripheral nervous system in 41% of patients. Mean age of onset was 50.1 years, and female:male ratio was 1.4. Patients were followed-up for a mean of 7.2 years, and at last visit 55% had a low disability grade (mRS 0-1). Disease was monophasic in 67% of patients, relapsing in 18% and chronic-progressive in 15%. The wGRS of PINS cases was comparable to 370 healthy controls, while significantly lower compared to 907 bout-onset MS (BOMS) cases (wGRS= 20.9 vs 21.2; p<0.0001). The difference was even larger for PINS with peripheral nervous system involvement (wGRS=20.6) vs BOMS. CONCLUSION: The distinction between MS and PINS is not easy to make in clinical practice. However, our study shows that the new set of MS risk alleles does not confer increased susceptibility to PINS. These data support the importance to discriminate these cases from MS with pathophysiological and therapeutic implications.

N2  - Background The management of peripheral nerve injuries remains a large challenge for plastic surgeons. With the inability to fuse axonal endings, results after microsurgical nerve repair have been inconsistent. Our current nerve repair strategies rely upon the slow and lengthy process of axonal regeneration (1 mm/d). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been investigated as a potential axonal fusion agent; however, the percentage of axonal fusion has been inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to identify a PEG delivery device to standardize outcomes after attempted axonal fusion with PEG. Materials and Methods We used a rat sciatic nerve injury model in which we completely transected and repaired the left sciatic nerve to evaluate the efficacy of PEG fusion over a span of 12 weeks. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of a delivery device's ability to optimize results after PEG fusion. Results We found that PEG rapidly (within minutes) restores axonal continuity as assessed by electrophysiology, fluorescent retrograde tracer, and diffusion tensor imaging. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that motor axon counts are significantly increased at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks postoperatively in PEG-treated animals. Furthermore, PEG restored behavioral functions up to 50% compared with animals that received the criterion standard epineurial repair (control animals). Conclusions The ability of PEG to rapidly restore nerve function after neurotmesis could have vast implications on the clinical management of traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is hallmarked by degeneration of small unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibers in the skin. Traditionally, it has been considered as a pure disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, previous work found that dysfunction of skin nerves led to abnormal recruitment of pain-related regions, suggesting that the brain may be affected in SFN. This report combined structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify structural and functional changes in the brain of 19 patients with SFN compared with 17 healthy controls. We applied tensor-based morphometry to detect brain structural alterations in SFN. Greater volume reduction in pain-processing regions, particularly the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices (ACCs), was associated with greater depletion of intraepidermal nerve fibers, a pathological biomarker of skin nerve degeneration. Based on the hypothesis that structural alterations in the pain-processing regions might impair their functional connectivity, we further applied psychophysiological interaction analysis to assess functional connectivity of the ACCs during noxious heat stimulation. There was significant reduction in functional connectivity from the ACCs to the limbic areas (the parahippocampal gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex), pain-processing area (the insula), and visuospatial areas (the cuneus). Moreover, the degree of reduction in functional connectivity for the ACC to the amygdala and the precuneus was linearly correlated with the severity of intraepidermal nerve fiber depletion. Our findings suggest that SFN is not a pure peripheral nervous system disorder. The pain-related brain networks tend to break into functionally independent components, with severity linked to the degree of skin nerve degeneration.Copyright © 2015 International Association for the Study of Pain.

N2  - Wallerian degeneration is the degeneration of the nerve fiber distally to damage of the axon. It classically has been described in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), but also takes place in the central nervous system (CNS). Wallerian degeneration in the CNS is much slower than in the PNS taking months to years and a secondary regeneration of the distal nerve fiber does not take place in the CNS. Thus, Wallerian degeneration may be a crucial factor influencing the functional loss after brain damage and can be detected using modern MR technniques. This article reviews the process of Wallerian degeneration in the CNS and the possibilities of imaging Wallerian degeneration in the human brain using MRI. While a decrease of signal intensities in proton-density-weighted images can be detected after 25 days and increased signal intensities in T2-weigthed images can be seen after 80 days, diffusion sensor imaging (DTI) can detect Wallerian degeneration much earlier. Several studies have demonstrated the decrease of fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corticospinal tracts after infarction of the medial cerebral artery (MCA) 2-6 month after stroke, 2-6 weeks after stroke, and 2-16 days after stroke. Moreover, a continuous decrease of FA over time in serial DT measurements after MCA infarction could be demonstrated. Changes in FA seem to be a parameter to quantify degeneration of tracts over time in single, compact fiber bundles such as the corticospinal tract, cerebellar peduncles, spinal cord white matter, the optic radiation, and corpus callosum. Thus, the detection and quantification of Wallerian degeneration may be a tool tor monitoring functional loss or functional regain after brain damage. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Purpose of review: Clinical investigations of peripheral nerve lesions routinely involve nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Imaging studies are often used to exclude focal mass lesions or external compression and to visualize muscle atrophy. More recently, it has been recognized that magnetic resonance imaging can identify changes in peripheral nerves and secondary neurogenic alterations in skeletal muscle, which may significantly enhance its use in the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. Recent findings: Acute axonal nerve lesions cause a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images at and distal to the lesion site, which correlates with Wallerian degeneration and nerve oedema. Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles provide an exciting new tool to detect the invasion of macrophages into the degenerating nerve distal to an axonal lesion. Prolongation of the T2 relaxation time and gadolinium enhancement of denervated muscle develop in parallel to the development of spontaneous activity on electromyography, and are probably the consequence of capillary enlargement and increased muscular blood volume. Summary: Magnetic resonance imaging supplements the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve disease. An advantage over clinical neurophysiological investigations is that it is operator independent and painless. It can identify axonal damage and may thus help to identify a lesion site precisely, where fractionated nerve conduction studies are not applicable. Novel contrast media may potentially be used to detect pathophysiologically relevant mechanisms such as infiltration of the nerve by macrophages. Magnetic resonance imaging also has the advantage of providing a lasting detailed topographical picture of regional variations and avoids localization errors of muscles in electromyography. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Nerve imaging is an important component in the assessment of patients presenting with suspected peripheral nerve pathology. Although magnetic resonance neurography and ultrasound are the most commonly utilized techniques, several promising new modalities are on the horizon. Nerve imaging is useful in localizing the nerve injury, determining the severity, providing prognostic information, helping establish the diagnosis, and helping guide surgical decision making. The focus of this article is imaging of damaged nerves, focusing on nerve injuries and entrapment neuropathies.

N2  - The aim of the study was to critically review the clinical approach to distinguish the sensory and motor nerve fascicles of the peripheral nerve system and to explore potential novel techniques to meet the clinical needs. The principles and shortcomings of the currently used methods for identification of sensory and motor nerve fascicles, including nerve morphology, electrical stimulation, spectroscopy, enzymohistochemistry staining (acetylcholinesterase [AchE], carbonic anhydrase [CA] and choline acetyltransferase [ChAC] histochemistry staining methods), and immunochemical staining were systematically reviewed. The progress in diffusion tensor imaging, proteomic approaches, and quantum dots (QDs) assessment in clinical applications to identify sensory or motor fascicles has been discussed. Traditional methods such as physical and enzymohistochemical methods are not suitable for the precise differentiation of sensory and motor nerve fascicles. Immunohistochemical staining using AchE, CA, and ChAC is promising in differentiation of sensory and motor nerve fascicles. Diffusion tensor imaging can reflect morphological details of nerve fibers. Proteomics can reveal the dynamics of specific proteins discriminating sensory and motor fascicles. QDs, with their size-dependent optical properties, make them the ideal protein markers for identification of the sensory or motor nerves. Diffusion tensor imaging, proteomics and QDs-imaging will facilitate the clinical identification of motor and sensory nerve fascicles, help in improving surgical success rates and assist in postoperative functional recovery. © 2016 Neurology India | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

N2  - Purpose To develop an in-vivo imaging method for the measurement of dorsal-root-ganglia-(DRG) perfusion, to establish its normal values in patients without known peripheral nerve disorders or radicular pain syndromes and to determine the physiological spatial perfusion pattern within the DRG. Methods This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. 46 (24 female, 22 male, mean age 46.0 ± 15.2 years) subjects without known peripheral neuropathies or pain syndromes were examined by a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom VERIO or TRIO, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) with a VIBE (Volume-Interpolated-Breathhold-Examination) dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) T1-w-sequence (TR/TE 3.3/1.11 ms; 24 slices; voxel resolution 1.3 × 1.3 × 3.0 mm3) covered the pelvis from the upper plate of the 5th lumbar vertebra to the 2nd sacral vertebra. Transfer-constant (Ktrans) and interstitial-volume-fraction (interstitial-leakage-fraction, Ve) were modeled for the DRG and spinal nerve by applying the Tofts-model. Statistical analyses included pairwise comparisons of L5/S1 DRG vs. spinal nerve. Furthermore, distinct physiological zones within the S1 DRG were compared (cell body rich area (CBRA) vs. nerve fiber rich area (NFRA)). Results DRG showed a significantly increased permeability compared to spinal nerve (Ktrans 3.8 ± 1.5 10− 3/min vs. 1.6 ± 0.9 10− 3/min, p-value: &lt; 0.001) combined with an increased interstitial leakage of contrast agent into the extravascular-extracellular-space (Ve 38.1 ± 19.2% vs. 17.3 ± 9.9%, p-value: &lt; 0.001). Parameters showed no statistically significant difference on DRG-level (L5 vs. S1; p-value: 0.62 (Ktrans); 0.17 (Ve)) and -side (left vs. right; p-value: 0.25 (Ktrans); 0.79 (Ve)). Female gender was associated with a significantly increased permeability (Ktrans female 4.3 ± 1.4 10− 3/min vs. male 3.4 ± 0.9 10− 3/min, p-value: &lt; 0.05) but no statistically significant differences in interstitial leakage (Ve female 40.1 ± 14,1% vs. male 34.5 ± 17.4%, p-value: 0.24). DRG showed distinct spatial distribution patterns of perfusion: Ktrans and Ve were significantly higher in the CBRA than in the NFRA (Ktrans 4.4 ± 1.8 10− 3/min vs. 1.7 ± 1.2 10− 3/min, p-value: &lt; 0.001 and Ve 40.9 ± 21.3% vs. 15.1 ± 11.7%, p-value: &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Non-invasive and in-vivo measurement of human DRG perfusion by MRI is a feasible technique. DRG show substantially higher permeability and interstitial leakage than spinal nerves. Even distinct physiological perfusion patterns for different microstructural compartments could be observed within the DRG. The technique may become particularly useful for future research on the poorly understood human sensory neuropathies and pain syndromes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate functional and morphometric magnetic resonance neurography of the dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve segments in patients with Fabry painful neuropathy. Methods: In this prospective study, the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and proximal peripheral nerve segments of the lower extremity were examined in 11 male patients with Fabry disease by a standardized 3T magnetic resonance neurography protocol. Volumes of L3 to S2 dorsal root ganglia, perfusion parameters of L5-S1 dorsal root ganglia and the spinal nerve L5, and the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic nerve were compared to healthy controls. Results: Dorsal root ganglia of patients with Fabry disease were symmetrically enlarged by 78% (L3), 94% (L4), 122% (L5), 115% (S1), and 119% (S2) (p < 0.001). In addition, permeability of the blood-tissue interface was decreased by 53% (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the peripheral zone of the dorsal root ganglion containing the cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons (p < 0.001). Spinal nerve permeability showed no difference between patients with Fabry disease and controls (p = 0.7). The sciatic nerve of patients with Fabry disease at the thigh level showed an increase in cross-sectional area by 48% (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with Fabry disease have severely enlarged dorsal root ganglia with dysfunctional perfusion. This may be due to glycolipid accumulation in the dorsal root ganglia mediating direct neurotoxic effects and decreased neuronal blood supply. These alterations were less pronounced in peripheral nerve segments. Thus, the dorsal root ganglion might play a key pathophysiologic role in the development of neuropathy and pain in Fabry disease. © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Objective. Despite modern antiretroviral therapy, HIV-associated neuropathy is one of the most prevalent, disabling and treatment-resistant complications of HIV disease. The presence and intensity of distal neuropathic pain is not fully explained by the degree of peripheral nerve damage. A better understanding of brain structure in HIV distal neuropathic pain may help explain why some patients with HIV neuropathy report pain while the majority does not. Previously, we reported that more intense distal neuropathic pain was associated with smaller total cerebral cortical gray matter volumes. The objective of this study was to determine which parts of the cortex are smaller. Methods. HIV positive individuals with and without distal neuropathic pain enrolled in the multisite (N5233) CNS HIV Antiretroviral Treatment Effects (CHARTER) study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate regional brain volumes in these structural brain images. Results. Left ventral posterior cingulate cortex was smaller for HIV positive individuals with versus without distal neuropathic pain (peak P50.017; peak t55.15; MNI coordinates x526, y5254, z520). Regional brain volumes within cortical gray matter structures typically associated with pain processing were also smaller for HIV positive individuals having higher intensity ratings of distal neuropathic pain. Conclusions. The posterior cingulate is thought to be involved in inhibiting the perception of painful stimuli. Mechanistically a smaller posterior cingulate cortex structure may be related to reduced anti-nociception contributing to increased distal neuropathic pain. © 2017, Oxford University Press.

N2  - Alpha-mannosidosis is a disease caused by the deficient activity of alpha-mannosidase, a lysosomal hydrolase involved in the degradation of glycoproteins. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides within lysosomes. The purpose of this study was to characterize the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) myelin abnormalities in cats from a breeding colony with a uniform mutation in the gene encoding alpha-mannosidase. Three affected cats and 3 normal cats from 2 litters were examined weekly from 4 to 18 wk of age. Progressively worsening neurological signs developed in affected cats that included tremors, loss of balance and nystagmus. In the PNS, affected cats showed slow motor nerve conduction velocity and increased F-wave latency. Single nerve fiber teasing revealed significant demyelination/remyelination in affected cats. Mean G-ratios of nerves showed a significant increase in affected cats compared to normal cats. Magnetic resonance imaging of the CNS revealed diffuse white matter signal abnormalities throughout the brain of affected cats. Quantitative magnetization transfer imaging showed a 8%-16% decrease in the magnetization transfer ratio in brain white matter of affected cats compared to normal cats, consistent with myelin abnormalities. Histology confirmed myelin loss throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. Thus, histology, electrodiagnostic testing, and magnetic resonance imaging identified significant myelination abnormalities in both the PNS and CNS that have not been described previously in alpha-mannosidosis.

N2  - Background: We present a clinical, electrophysiological, sonographical and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) study examining the complementary role of two neuroimaging methods of the peripheral nervous system for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Furthermore, we explore the significance of cross-sectional area (CSA) increase through correlations with MRN markers of nerve integrity. Methods: A total of 108 nerve segments on the median, ulnar, radial, tibial and fibular nerve, as well as the lumbar and cervical plexus of 18 CIDP patients were examined with high-resonance nerve ultrasound (HRUS) and MRN additionally to the nerve conduction studies. Results: We observed a fair degree of correlation of the CSA values for all nerves/nerve segments between the two methods, with a low random error in Bland–Altman analysis (bias = HRUS-CSA − MRN-CSA, −0.61 to −3.26 mm). CSA in HRUS correlated with the nerve T2-weighted (nT2) signal increase as well as with diffusion tensor imaging parameters such as fractional anisotropy, a marker of microstructural integrity. HRUS-CSA of the interscalene brachial plexus correlated significantly with the MRN-CSA and nT2 signal of the L5 and S1 roots of the lumbar plexus. Conclusions: HRUS allows for reliable CSA imaging of all peripheral nerves and the cervical plexus, and CSA correlates with markers of nerve integrity. Imaging of proximal segments as well as the estimation of nerve integrity require MRN as a complementary method. © The Author(s), 2018.

N2  - Objectives. It is widely accepted that peripheral nerve repairs performed within 6 weeks of injury have much better outcomes than those performed at later dates. However, there is no diagnostic technique that can determine if a traumatic peripheral nerve injury requires surgical intervention in the early postinjury phase. The objective of this article was to determine whether novel, noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging techniques could demonstrate the microstructure of human peripheral nerves that is necessary for determining prognosis and determining if surgery is indicated following traumatic injury. Methods. Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging protocols were developed on a 9.4-T research scanner using spin-echo proton density and gradient-echo imaging sequences and a specially designed, inductively coupled radio frequency coil. These imaging protocols were applied to in situ imaging of the human median nerve in 4 fresh-frozen cadaver arms. Results. Noninvasive high-resolution images of the human median nerve were obtained. Structures in the nerve that were observed included fascicles, interfascicular epineurium, perineurium, and intrafascicular septations. Conclusion. Application of these imaging techniques to clinical scanners could provide physicians with a tool that is capable of grading the severity of nerve injuries and providing indications for surgery in the early postinjury phase.

N2  - Objectives The aims of this preliminary study were to determine the number of axonal bundles (fascicles) in the median nerve,1 using a high-resolution, proton density (PD)-turbo spin echo (TSE) fat suppression sequence, and to determine normative T2 values, measured by triple-echo steady state, of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), at 7 T.2 Materials and Methods: This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee and conducted between March 2014 and January 2015. All study participants gave written informed consent. Six healthy volunteers (30 ± 12 years) and 5 patients with CTS (44 ± 16 years) were included. Measurements were performed on both wrists in all volunteers and on the affected wrist in patients (3 right, 2 left). Based on 5-point scales, 2 readers assessed image quality (1, very poor; 5, very good) and the presence of artifacts that might have a possible influence on fascicle determination (1, severe artifacts; 5, no artifacts) and counted the number of fascicles independently on the PD-TSE sequences. Furthermore, T2 values by region of interest analysis were assessed. Student t tests, a hierarchic linear model, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used for statistical analysis. Results: Proton density-TSE image quality and artifacts revealed a median of 5 in healthy volunteers and 4 in patients with CTS for both readers. Fascicle count of the median nerve ranged from 13 to 23 in all subjects, with an ICC of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.95). T2 values were significantly higher (P = 0.023) in patients (24.27 ± 0.97 milliseconds [95% CI, 22.19-26.38]) compared with healthy volunteers (21.01 ± 0.65 milliseconds [95% CI, 19.61-22.41]). The ICC for all T2 values was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98). Conclusions: This study shows the possibility of fascicle determination of the median nerve in healthy volunteers and patients with CTS (although probably less accurately) with high-resolution 7 T magnetic resonance imaging, as well as significantly higher T2 values in patients with CTS, which seems to be associated with pathophysiological nerve changes.

N2  - PURPOSE To implement high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for visualization and quantification of peripheral nerves in human forearm. MATERIALS AND METHODS This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all the study participants. Images were acquired with T1 -and T2 -weighted turbo spin echo with/without fat saturation, short tau inversion recovery (STIR). In addition, high spatial resolution (1.0 × 1.0 × 3.0 mm(3) ) DTI sequence was optimized for clearly visualizing ulnar, superficial radial and median nerves in the forearm. Maps of the DTI derived indices, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity (λ// ) and radial diffusivity (λ⊥ ) were generated. RESULTS For the first time, the three peripheral nerves, ulnar, superficial radial, and median, were visualized unequivocally on high resolution DTI-derived maps. DTI delineated the forearm nerves more clearly than other sequences. Significant differences in the DTI-derived measures, FA, MD, λ// and λ⊥ , were observed among the three nerves. A strong correlation between the nerve size derived from FA map and T2 -weighted images was observed. CONCLUSION High spatial resolution DTI is superior in identifying and quantifying the median, ulnar, and superficial radial nerves in human forearm. Consistent visualization of small nerves and nerve branches is possible with high spatial resolution DTI. These normative data could potentially help in identifying pathology in diseased nerves. J.

N2  - This article provides a review of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and how to get started. It explains step by step how to establish MRN at an institution: how to set up MRN protocols, how to train technicians, what a report needs to contain, and how relevant findings should be communicated to the referring physician. Advanced imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging are only briefly discussed at the end of the article because most of those techniques are difficult for beginners and are still not considered standard in the clinical routine. © 2018 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.

N2  - Evaluation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries has classically been
based on clinical and electrophysiologic criteria. US and MRI have been
widely used for morphologic assessment of nerve injury sites and
concomitant lesions. In the past few years, morphologic MR neurography
has significantly increased its clinical applications on the basis of
three-dimensional or two-dimensional images with and without
fat-suppression techniques. However, these sequences have a major
drawback: absence of pathophysiologic information about functional
integrity or axonal flow of peripheral nerves. In this scenario,
functional MRI techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) or
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used as a complementary tool in
initial evaluation of peripheral nerve trauma or in assessment of trauma
undergoing surgical repair. These approaches provide not only
morphologic but also functional information about extent and degree of
nerve impairment. Functional MR neurography can also be applied to
selection, planning, and monitoring of surgical procedures that can be
performed after traumatic peripheral nerve injuries, such as
neurorrhaphy, nerve graft, or neurolysis, as it provides surgeons with
valuable information about the functional status of the nerves involved
and axonal flow integrity. The physical basis of DWI and DTI and the
technical adjustments required for their appropriate performance for
peripheral nerve evaluation are reviewed. Also, the clinical value of
DWI and DTI in assessment of peripheral nerve trauma is discussed,
enhancing their potential impact on selection, planning, and monitoring
of surgical procedures employed for peripheral nerve repair.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) and estimates of diffusivity are sensitive to the microstructure of peripheral nerves and may be displayed as tractograms. However, the ideal conditions for tractography of the roots of the brachial plexus are unclear, which represents the rationale for this study. Ten healthy adults were scanned using a Siemens Prisma (3T) and single-shot echo-planar imaging (b-value 0/1000 s/mm2, 64 directions, 2.5 mm3 with 4 averages; repeated in opposing phase encoding directions). Susceptibility correction and tractography were performed in DSI Studio by two independent raters. The effect of FA thresholding at increments of 0.01 (from 0.04 to 0.10) were tested. The mean FA varied between subjects by 2% (95% CI 1%, 3%). FA thresholds of 0.04, 0.05 and 0.06 all propagated 96% of tracts representing the roots; thresholding at 0.07 yielded 4% fewer tracts (p = 0.2), 0.08 yielded 11% fewer tracts (p = 0.008), 0.09 yielded 15% fewer tracts (p = 0.001) and 0.1 yielded 20% fewer tracts (p &lt; 0.001). There was &lt; 0.1% inter-rater variability in the measured FA and 99% agreement for tractography (κ = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001). The fractional anisotropy thresholds required to generate tractograms of the roots of the brachial plexus appears to be lower than those used in the brain. We provide estimates of the probability of generating true tracts for each spinal nerve root of the brachial plexus, at different fractional anisotropy thresholds. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - THE FORCE AND fatigue of the wrist extensor muscles during maximal voluntary and tetanic contractions were measured and compared in the injured and noninjured extremities of 11 patients with radial nerve gap injury and in 9 normal volunteers. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the wrist extensor muscles was determined by magnetic resonance imaging and was correlated with force. In the patient group, an average of three (range, 2-4) sural nerve cable grafts, measuring 11.5 +/- 5 cm (range, 5-20 cm) in length, were sutured to the nerve stumps at least 9 years before this study. Differences in the CSA values of the injured and noninjured arms were compared, and a ratio was established (CSA(R)). The mean CSA(R) was 82.9% +/- 14.3. These differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.10, paired t-test). Despite very well-recovered muscular mass, the maximal voluntary contraction force was found to be incompletely recovered by up to 62.7% +/- 23, when compared with the noninjured side (P < 0.05, paired t-test). The fraction maximal voluntary contraction force/CSA had decreased by up to 76.4% +/- 25.5 (P < 0.05, paired t-test). An increased fatigability of the affected muscles persisted in all patients. The patients' noninjured extremity behaved in the same way as that of the dominant extremity of normal volunteers with regard to force, lever, and CSA values. In the best-recovered patients, the relation of the maximal voluntary contraction force between the noninjured and the injured side was the same (90% +/- 9.9) as that found between the dominant and the nondominant extremity of normal volunteers (P < 0.05, paired t-test). In more than half of the patients, sural nerve cables provided adequate reinnervation of the wrist extensor muscles to enable them to recover and even to exceed the bottom 5% contraction force (139 N) reported by other authors for the normal male population. Several anatomical features of the radial nerve, however, also participated in a favorable outcome of the motor function after autografting of this nerve.

N2  - OBJECTIVE - To characterize structural changes and the metabolic profile of foot muscles and correlate them with diabetic neuropathy measurements using phosphorus-31 (31P) rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We studied 12 control subjects, 9 nonneuropathic diabetic patients, and 12 neuropathic diabetic patients using 31P RARE and proton ( 1H) MRI at 3 Tesla. The ratio of the total cross-sectional area of the foot to that of the muscle tissue was calculated from transaxial 1H and 31P images. The average 31P concentration across the metatarsal head region was measured from the 31P images. RESULTS - The muscle area-to-total area ratio differed among all three groups (means +/- SD): 0.55 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.06 for control, nonneuropathic, and neuropathic subjects, respectively (P < 0.0001). The average 31P concentration also differed among all groups: 27.7 +/- 3.8 vs. 21.7 +/- 4.8 vs. 7.9 +/- 8.8 mmol/l for control, nonneuropathic, and neuropathic subjects (P < 0.0001). The muscle area-to-total area ratio strongly correlated with clinical measurements: Neuropathy Disability Score, r = -0.83, P < 0.0001; vibration perception threshold, r = -0.79, P < 0.0001; and Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, r = -0.87, P < 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS - Small muscle atrophy is present in diabetes before clinical peripheral neuropathy can be detected using standard clinical techniques. The 31P RARE MRI method evaluates the severity of muscle atrophy, even in the early stages when neuropathy is absent. This technique may prove to be a useful diagnostic tool in identifying early-stage diabetic foot problems. © 2005 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - Peripheral nerves are a composite tissue consisting of neurovascular elements packaged within a well-organized extracellular matrix. Their composition, size, and anatomy render nerves a challenging medical imaging target. In contrast to morphological MRI, which represents the predominant approach to nerve imaging, quantitative MRI sequences can provide information regarding tissue composition. Here, we applied standard clinical Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) and experimental three-dimensional (3D) ultrashort echo time (UTE) Cones sequences for quantitative nerve imaging including T2 measurement with single-component analysis, T2* measurement with single-component and bi-component analyses, and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) analysis. We demonstrated the feasibility and the high quality of single-component T2*, bi-component T2*, and MTR approaches to analyze nerves imaged with clinically deployed 3D UTE Cones pulse sequences. For 24 single fascicles from eight nerves, we measured a mean single-component T2* of 22.6 +/-8.9 ms, and a short T2* component (STC) with a mean T2* of 1.7 +/-1.0 ms and a mean fraction of (6.74 +/-4.31)% in bi-component analysis. For eight whole nerves, we measured a mean single-component T2* of 16.7 +/-2.2 ms, and an STC with a mean T2* of 3.0 +/-1.0 ms and a mean fraction of (15.56 +/-7.07)% in bi-component analysis. For nine fascicles from three healthy nerves, we measured a mean MTR of (25.2 +/-1.9)% for single fascicles and a mean MTR of (23.6 +/-0.9)% for whole nerves. No statistically significant correlation was observed between any MRI parameter and routine histological outcomes, perhaps due to the small sample size and lack of apparent sample pathology. Overall, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of measuring quantitative MR outcomes ex vivo, which might reflect features of nerve structure and macromolecular content. These methods should be validated comprehensively on a larger and more diverse set of nerve samples, towards the interpretation of in vivo outcomes. These approaches have new and broad implications for the management of nerve disease, injury, and repair.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of peripheral nerves may provide additional information about nerve involvement in muscular disorders, but is considered difficult due to different optimal scan parameters tailored to magnetic resonance (MR) signal properties of muscle and neural tissues. Purpose: To assess the feasibility of sciatic nerve DTI using two different approaches of region of interest (ROI)-localization in DTI scans with b-values 500 s/mm2, in participants with muscular disorders and in controls. Material and Methods: DTI of the thigh was conducted on a 3T system in ten patients (6 men, 4 women; mean age =54 ± 15 years) with neuromuscular disorders and ten controls. T1-weighted (T1W) images were co-registered to fractional anisotropy (FA) color-encoded images. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, and fiber track length (FTL) were analyzed by two operators using a freehand ROI and a single-point ROI covering the sciatic nerve. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland–Altman analysis were used for evaluation of inter-operator and inter-technical agreement, respectively. Results: Three-dimensional visualization of sciatic nerve fiber was achievable using both techniques. The ICC of DTI metrics showed excellent inter-operator agreement both in patients and controls. Bland–Altman analysis revealed good agreement of both techniques. A maximum FTL was achieved using the single-point ROI technique, but with a lower inter-operator agreement (ICC = 0.99 vs. 0.83). The ADC and maximum FTL were significantly decreased in patients compared to controls. Conclusion: Both ROI localization techniques are feasible to analyze the sciatic nerve in the setting of muscular disease. A maximum FTL is reached using the single-point ROI, however, at the cost of lower inter-operator agreement. © 2017, © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2017.

N2  - Objectives The aim of this study was to describe the development of morphologic and diffusion tensor imaging sequences of peripheral nerves at 7 T, using carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as a model system of focal nerve injury. Materials and Methods Morphologic images were acquired at 7 T using a balanced steady-state free precession sequence. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed using single-shot echo-planar imaging and readout-segmented echo-planar imaging sequences. Different acquisition and postprocessing methods were compared to describe the optimal analysis pipeline. Magnetic resonance imaging parameters including cross-sectional areas, signal intensity, fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as mean, axial, and radial diffusivity were compared between patients with CTS (n = 8) and healthy controls (n = 6) using analyses of covariance corrected for age (significance set at P < 0.05). Pearson correlations with Bonferroni correction were used to determine association of magnetic resonance imaging parameters with clinical measures (significance set at P < 0.01). Results The 7 T acquisitions with high in-plane resolution (0.2 x 0.2mm) afforded detailed morphologic resolution of peripheral nerve fascicles. For diffusion tensor imaging, single-shot echo-planar imaging was more efficient than readout-segmented echo-planar imaging in terms of signal-to-noise ratio per unit scan time. Distortion artifacts were pronounced, but could be corrected during postprocessing. Registration of FA maps to the morphologic images was successful. The developed imaging and analysis pipeline identified lower median nerve FA (pisiform bone, 0.37 [SD 0.10]) and higher radial diffusivity (1.08 [0.20]) in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (0.53 [0.06] and 0.78 [0.11], respectively, P < 0.047). Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity strongly correlated with patients' symptoms (r = -0.866 and 0.866, respectively, P = 0.005). Conclusions Our data demonstrate the feasibility of morphologic and diffusion peripheral nerve imaging at 7 T. Fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity were found to be correlates of symptom severity.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP) is caused by a heterozygous deletion of peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene resulting in focal sensorimotor deficits. Our lab has identified a disruption of myelin junctions in excessively permeable myelin that impairs action potential propagation. This mechanism is expected to cause fatigue in patients with HNPP. Therefore, the objective was to characterize fatigue in patients with HNPP and determine the relationship of fatigue to nerve pathology, disability, and quality of life. Method(s): Nine females with HNPP participated in a single visit that included genotyping, nerve conduction studies, neurological exam, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, and a physical therapy exam incorporating upper and lower extremity function and survey measures of fatigue. This visit was followed by 2 weeks of ecological momentary assessment (wrist-worn device) that captured fatigue ratings five times per day. Result(s): Participants demonstrated mild neurological impairment (CMTNS: 5.7 +/- 2.8), yet reported high fatigue levels (average fatigue intensity over 2 weeks: 5.9 out of 10). Higher fatigue levels were associated with poorer quality of life and more pain. Higher fatigue was associated with significantly greater distal nerve proton density changes on peripheral nerve MRI, which is in line with hyper-permeable myelin in HNPP. Interpretation(s): Fatigue is common and severe among patients with HNPP whose disabilities are minimal by conventional outcome measures. Therapeutic interventions targeting fatigue have the potential to improve quality of life and may serve as a robust outcome measure to show longitudinal changes for patients with HNPP.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - We previously reported that neuropathic pain was associated with smaller posterior cingulate cortical (PCC) volumes, suggesting that a smaller/dysfunctional PCC may contribute to development of pain via impaired mind wandering. A gap in our previous report was lack of evidence for a mechanism for the genesis of PCC atrophy in HIV peripheral neuropathy. Here we investigate if volumetric differences in the subcortex for those with neuropathic paresthesia may contribute to smaller PCC volumes, potentially through deafferentation of ascending white matter tracts resulting from peripheral nerve damage in HIV neuropathy. Since neuropathic pain and paresthesia are highly correlated, statistical decomposition was used to separate pain and paresthesia symptoms to determine which regions of brain atrophy are associated with both pain and paresthesia and which are associated separately with pain or paresthesia. HIV+ individuals (N = 233) with and without paresthesia in a multisite study underwent structural brain magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry and a segmentation/registration tool were used to investigate regional brain volume changes associated with paresthesia. Analysis of decomposed variables found that smaller midbrain and thalamus volumes were associated with paresthesia rather than pain. However, atrophy in the PCC was related to both pain and paresthesia. Peak thalamic atrophy (p = 0.004; MNI x = − 14, y = − 24, z = − 2) for more severe paresthesia was in a region with reciprocal connections with the PCC. This provides initial evidence that smaller PCC volumes in HIV peripheral neuropathy are related to ascending white matter deafferentation caused by small fiber damage observed in HIV peripheral neuropathy. © 2020, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.

N2  - Background: Peripheral nerve injury is often followed by a highly variable recovery process with respect to both rapidity and efficacy. Identifying post-nerve injury phenomena is key to assessing the merit and timing of surgery as well as to tracking nerve recovery postoperatively. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has been investigated in the clinical and research settings as a noninvasive technique to both assess and monitor each patient's unique case of peripheral nerve damage. New method: We identify a MRI-suitable marker for tracking the exact site of either nerve injury or coaptation following surgical repair to aid with DTI analysis. Results: Due to artefact and disruption of tractography, silver wire and microvascular clips were not suitable markers. AxoGuard® 4-0 vicryl suture, and 10-0 polyamide suture, although detectable, did not produce a signal easily distinguished from post-surgical changes. Silicone was easily identifiable and stable in both the acute and delayed time points, exhibited negligible impact on DTI parameters, and possessed geometry to prevent nerve strangulation. Comparison with existing method: Prior studies have not assessed the efficacy of other markers nor have they assessed silicone for potential artefact with DTI parameter analysis. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the reliability and compatibility of silicone in the delayed postoperative time period and includes its unique imaging appearance on high-resolution 11.7 MRI. Conclusion: Semi-cylindrical silicone tubing can be used as a safe, reliable, and readily available radiological marker to visualize and monitor a region of interest on a rodent's peripheral nerve for aiding assessments with diffusion tensor imaging. © 2018

N2  - Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of 3 T magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brachial plexus in healthy subjects. Methods Ten healthy volunteers were included, and morphological and DTI sequences of the nerve roots of the brachial plexus from C5 to T1 of both sides were repeatedly acquired on a 3 T magnetic resonance system (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). A prototype diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence-enabling slice-specific shim adjustments was performed with b-values of 0 and 800 s/mm2 in 30 gradient directions, resulting in an acquisition time of about 6 minutes each in axial orientation. Between scans, subjects were moved and repositioned in the scanner, coils were reinserted, and new localizers were acquired. Image analysis was performed using MITK Diffusion software toolkit. Two independent readers performed diffusion data postprocessing, and regions of interest (ROIs) were set on the proximal postganglionic trunk at each spinal level, bilaterally to obtain values for fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Interreader and intrareader agreement as well as test-retest reproducibility of DTI metrics were assessed. Results Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for interreader and intrareader agreement did not differ significantly between measurements for FA and MD. In particular, ICCs for interreader agreement of FA ranged from 0.741 to 0.961 and that of MD ranged from 0.802 to 0.998, and ICCs for intrareader agreement of FA ranged from 0.759 to 0.949 and that of MD ranged from 0.796 to 0.998. The test-retest reproducibility of DTI metrics showed an overall moderate to strong correlation (r > 0.707), with few minor exceptions, for both FA and MD values. Conclusions Diffusion tensor imaging metrics in the brachial plexus are reproducible. Future applications of DTI for a possible clinical use should be further investigated.

N2  - Purpose To investigate the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 measurements in the evaluation of radiation-induced peripheral nerve injury (RIPNI). Materials and Methods RIPNI was produced in a randomly selected side of sciatic nerve in each of 21 rabbits while the contralateral side served as the control. The limb function and MR parameters were evaluated over a 4-month period. Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (λâ), radial diffusivity (λâ) and T2 values were obtained using 3T MR for quantitative analysis. Two animals were randomly killed for histological evaluation at each timepoint. Results The T2 value of irradiated nerve increased at 1 day (63.95 ± 15.60, P = 0.012) and was restored at 1 month (52.34 ± 5.38, P = 0.105). It increased progressively at 2 to 4 months (60.39 ± 10.60, 66.96 ± 6.08, 75.51 ± 7.39, all P &lt; 0.01). λâ significantly increased at 1 day (0.82 ± 0.44, P = 0.046) and slightly decreased at 1 month (0.61 ± 0.17, P &lt; 0.001). It increased gradually from 2 to 3 months (0.84 ± 0.29, 1.13 ± 0.33, both P &lt; 0.001) followed by a decline at 4 months (0.83 ± 0.17, P &lt; 0.001). FA was statistically lower than the contralateral sides at 1 to 4 months (0.72 ± 0.08, 0.60 ± 0.12, 0.51 ± 0.11, 0.62 ± 0.06, all P &lt; 0.01). Changes in FA and λâ correlated well with the functional and pathological changes in irradiated nerve. Conclusion DTI may be a more sensitive and accurate method to evaluate RIPNI compared with T2 measurements. FA and λâ are promising quantitative indices in monitoring RIPNI. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to determine the intrasubject side-to-side variability of quantitative and qualitative measures of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography of the median nerves and to determine the precision of quantitative measurements and fiber tractography. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifteen healthy volunteers (seven men, eight women; mean age, 31.2 years) underwent DTI of both wrists with a single-shot spin-echo-based echoplanar imaging sequence (TR/TE, 7,000/103; b value 1,025 s/mm2). Postprocessing included fiber tractography and quantitative analysis of fiber length, fiber density index, fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, and signal-to-noise ratio. Two readers in consensus graded the quality of fiber tract images of the two wrists as equal, slightly different, or very different. Fiber tractography and all analyses were repeated after 3 weeks, and the images from the two sessions were compared. RESULTS. No statistically significant side-to-side differences in quantitative data were found (p = 0.054-0.999). In all subjects, the quality of fiber tract images of the right and left median nerves was either slightly or very different. Between the initial and the second quantitative analyses, no statistically significant differences (p = 0.086-0.898) were found, and the quality of fiber tract images was rated equal for nine of 15 subjects (60%) and slightly different for six of 15 subjects (40%). CONCLUSION. Preliminary results indicate that quantitative evaluation of DTI of the median nerve is precise. The absence of statistically significant intrasubject side-to-side variability in quantitative data suggests that the healthy contralateral nerve can be used as an internal control. Observed side-to-side variability in the quality of fiber tract images, however, rules out side-to-side comparisons in fiber tractography. © American Roentgen Ray Society.

N2  - Background Brachial plexus (BP) is composed of intercommunications among the ventral roots of the nerves C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1 in the neck. The in vivo and in vitro evaluation of axons of the peripheral nervous system is performed using different techniques. Recently, many studies describing the application of fiber tractography and stereological axon number estimation to peripheral nerves have been published. Methods Various quantitative parameters of nerve fibers, including axon number, density, axonal area, and myelin thickness, can be estimated using stereological techniques. In vivo three-dimensional reconstruction of axons of BP can be visualized using a combined technique of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tracking with the potential to evaluate nerve fiber content. Conclusion It is concluded that terminal branches of BP can be successfully visualized using DTI, which is a highly reproducible method for the evaluation of BP as it shows anatomical and functional features of neural structures. We believe that quantitative morphological findings obtained from BP will be useful for new experimental, developmental, and pathological studies in the future. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.

N2  - Objective: To investigate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation during somatosensory electrical stimulation of the median nerve in acute stroke patients and to determine its correlation with ischemic damage and clinical recovery over time. Methods: Fourteen acute stroke patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during contralesional median-nerve electrical stimulation 12-48. h after stroke. Findings were then validated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and motor evoked potential by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Results: Poor clinical recovery at three months was noted in four patients with no activation in the early days after stroke, whereas good clinical recovery was observed in eight patients with a normal activation pattern in the primary sensory motor area in the acute phase. In two patients BOLD activation correlated weakly with clinical recovery. Findings from TMS and DTI partially correlated with clinical recovery and functional scores. Conclusions: Clinically relevant insights into the " functional reserve" of stroke patients gained with peripheral nerve stimulation during fMRI may carry prognostic value already in the acute period of a cerebrovascular accident. Significance: BOLD activation maps could provide insights into the functional organization of the residual systems and could contribute to medical decision making in neurological and rehabilitative treatment. © 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

N2  - Objective: Epineural scar formation is one of the most significant negative factors affecting surgical repair after peripheral nerve injury. The scar tissue mechanically hinders axonal regeneration and causes adhesions between nerves and surrounding tissues. A hemostatic agent Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS; I˙mmun Gida I˙laç Kozmetik San. ve Tic. Ltd. Sti., Istanbul, Turkey) has not been previously used. Decreasing the postoperative bleeding and adhesions between nerve and surrounding tissues will prevent the formation of scar tissue, as well as corresponding compressive neuropathy and/or deceleration of axonal regeneration. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the effects of bleeding on nerve healing and scar tissue after repair of peripheral nerve injuries. Methods: The right sciatic nerve of 30 Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 260-330 g) was cut 1.5 cm proximal to the trifurcation and repaired primarily with 8/0 sutures using epineural technique. The rats were then divided into 3 groups. Saline was applied in Group 1 (n=10), ABS in Group 2 (n=10), and heparin in Group 3 (n=10) for 5 minutes to the repair site and surrounding tissues. In each group, electrophysiological measurements were performed with electromyography (EMG) at postoperative week 12. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging was used at week 12. Macroscopical and histopathological evaluations were conducted after sacrificing the rats at week 24 with total excision of the repaired sciatic nerves and surrounding tissues. Results: The ABS and saline groups showed better healing than the heparin group. The ABS and saline groups were better in the histopathologic evaluations, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Statistically significant differences were not found between the 3 groups. Significant results may be obtained with larger studies. © 2016 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.

N2  - Introduction We investigated the correlation between age and the fractional anisotropy (FA) values of peripheral nerves in healthy adults and compared the age-corrected FA values of peripheral nerves in healthy subjects and patients with polyneuropathy. Methods The institutional review board approved this study and informed consent was obtained from all participants before entry into the study. We optimized diffusion tensor imaging using a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner and an extremity coil for scanning tibial nerves. The effect of age and sex on the FA values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers was investigated and the age-corrected FA values of tibial nerves in healthy volunteers and patients with polyneuropathy were compared. Results The maximum FAvalues of the tibial nerves remained constant until age 45 (approximately 0.516); they subsequently decreased by 0.004/year in healthy volunteers. After removing the effect of age with an age-adjusted equation, the median maximum FAvalues in the volunteers and patients were 0.518 (range, 0.406-0.616) and 0.442 (range, 0.376-0.530), respectively. The age-corrected FAvalues were significantly lower in the patients than the healthy volunteers (p<0.001). There was no significant gender-related difference in the maximum FA values of the tibial nerves (p=0.416). Conclusion The age-corrected FA value of the peripheral nerves helps to differentiate between age-related peripheral nerve degeneration and polyneuropathies. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - OBJECTIVE - The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is poorly understood. We have recently reported a significant reduction in spinal cord cross-sectional area at the stage of clinically detectable DPN. In this study, we investigated whether spinal cord atrophy occurs in early (subclinical) DPN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Eighty-one male type 1 diabetic subjects, 24 nondiabetic control subjects, and 8 subjects with hereditary sensory motor neuropathy (HSMN) type 1A underwent detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments. Diabetic subjects were subsequently divided into three groups based on neuropathy severity (19 with no DPN, 23 with subclinical DPN, and 39 with clinically detectable DPN). All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine and cord area measurements at disc level C2/C3. RESULTS - Mean corrected spinal cord area index (SCAI) (corrected for age, height, and weight) was 67.5 mm [95% CI 64.1-70.9] in diabetic subjects without DPN. Those with subclinical (62.4mm[59.5- 65.3]) and clinically detectable DPN (57.2mm[54.9 -59.6]) had lower mean SCAIs compared with subjects with no DPN (P = 0.03 and P < 0.001, respectively). No significant difference was found between diabetic subjects without DPN and nondiabetic control subjects (69.2 mm [66.3-72.0], P = 0.47). Mean SCAIs in subjects with HSMN type 1A (71.07 mm[65.3-76.9]) were not significantly different from those for nondiabetic control subjects and diabetic subjects without DPN. Among diabetic subjects, SCAI was significantly related to sural sensory conduction velocities and the Neuropathy Composite and Symptom Scores. CONCLUSIONS - Spinal cord involvement occurs early in DPN. There is also a significant relation between reduction in SCAI and neurophysiological assessments of DPN. © 2006 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - The majority of previous studies on hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) were focused on peripheral nerves, whereas cerebral alterations in HNPP have been less attended to. In this work, DTI was used to detect the changes in WM, especially in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in HNPP patients for its sensitivity in probing the microstructure of WM, the sensitive metric was searched for probing cerebral alterations and the regional distribution of cerebral abnormalities was identified. Twelve HNPP patients and 12 age-and gender-matched healthy controls underwent the conventional MRI, DTI scan, and electrophysiological examination. The conventional MRI images were first analyzed to identify abnormal intense regions and the NAWM regions. NAWM refers to the white matter regions that do not include the lesions on conventional MRI. The ADC and FA values of the NAWM were then measured and compared between patient and control groups. The sensitivity and specificity of 3 methods and the cerebral regional distribution of MR signal abnormalities were further analyzed. Hyperintense foci were observed on T2WI and FLAIR images in 6 patients. Compared to the controls, FA values of the patients were significantly lower in bilateral frontal, orbitofrontal, and temporal NAWMs; whereas the electrophysiological examination results of patients and controls exhibited no statistically significant difference. The sensitivity of FA value was higher than that of electrophysiological examination and conventional MRI. The majority of abnormal signals on conventional MRI images and abnormal FA values were located in the frontal and temporal lobes. The results of our study show cerebral WM changes in HNPP patients. FA value in DTI has been shown to be sensitive to the cerebral microstructural changes in HNPP. The frontal lobe is the predilection site that is most involved in HNPP.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics as biomarkers for the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in acute peripheral nerve injury. Materials and Methods: Forty-four adult rats received subepineurial microinjection of MSCs (n = 22) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n = 22) 1 week after the sciatic nerve trunk crush injury. Sequential fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging, T2 measurement, DTI and sciatic nerve functional assessment were performed at a 3.0 Tesla MR unit over an 8-week follow-up, with histological assessments performed at regular intervals. The sciatic nerve function index, T2 value, and DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity values of the distal stumps of crushed nerves were measured and compared between the two groups. Results: Nerves treated with MSCs showed better functional recovery and exhibited more pronounced nerve regeneration compared with nerves treated with PBS. T2 values in nerves treated with MSCs or PBS showed a similar change pattern (P = 0.174), while FA and RD values in nerves treated with MSCs showed more rapid return (one week earlier) to baseline level than nerves treated with PBS (P = 0.045; 0.035). Nerves treated with MSCs had higher FA and lower RD values than nerves treated with PBS during the period from 2 to 3 weeks after surgery (P ≤ 0.0001, 0.004; P = 0.004, 0.006). Conclusion: FA and RD values derived from DTI might be used as sensitive biomarkers for detecting the therapeutic effect of stem cells in acute peripheral nerve crush injuries. Level of Evidence: 2.

N2  - Purpose: To examine dorsal root ganglia and proximal nerve segments in patients carrying the Fabry-related GLA-gene variant p.D313Y in comparison to patients with classical Fabry mutations and healthy controls by morphometric and functional magnetic resonance neurography. Methods: This prospective multicenter study examines the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve in 11 female p.D313Y patients by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3 T. Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3 to S2, permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1, and spinal nerve L5 as well as cross-sectional area of the sciatic nerve were assessed and compared to 10 females carrying a classical Fabry mutation and 16 healthy female controls. Results: Compared to healthy controls, dorsal root ganglia volumes of p.D313Y females were enlarged by 53% (L3), 48% (L4), 43% (L5), 57% (S1) (p < 0.001), and 55% (S2) (p < 0.05), but less pronounced compared to females carrying a classical Fabry mutation. Compared to healthy controls, p.D313Y patients showed no changes of dorsal root ganglia vascular permeability, while patients with a classical Fabry mutation showed a distinct decrease (p < 0.05). Sciatic nerve cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6% in p.D313Y as well as in classical Fabry patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Patients carrying the GLA-gene variant p.D313Y show distinctly enlarged dorsal root ganglia, while vascular permeability remains within normal limits. Overall, these alterations partially share characteristics commonly seen in patients with a mutation causing classical FD. This suggests that p.D313Y causes a potentially treatable condition resembling an early stage of Fabry disease. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Purpose: To examine dorsal root ganglia and the proximal nerve segments in female patients with Fabry disease by functional and morphometric magnetic resonance neurography. Method(s): In this prospective multicenter study the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia and proximal sciatic nerve were examined in ten female patients with Fabry disease by a standardized magnetic resonance neurography protocol at 3 T. Volumes of dorsal root ganglia L3-S2, permeability of dorsal root ganglia L5 and S1 and the spinal nerve L5 as well as the cross-sectional area of the proximal sciatic nerve were compared to 16 gender-matched healthy controls. Result(s): Dorsal root ganglia were symmetrically enlarged by 54% (L3), 79% (L4), 60% (L5), 94% (S1), and 106% (S2) (p < 0.001). Additionally, permeability of the blood-tissue interface was decreased by 47% (p < 0.001). This finding was most pronounced in the peripheral zone of the dorsal root ganglia, where the cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons are located (p < 0.001). While spinal nerve permeability showed no differences compared to healthy controls, proximal sciatic nerve cross-sectional area was mildly increased by 6% (p < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Although heterozygous, Fabry females show severe enlarged dorsal root ganglia with a concomitant dysfunctional perfusion, even in patients with minor disease progression and in patients who are not considered for enzyme replacement therapy yet. Alterations in dorsal root ganglia volume and perfusion might serve as a very early in vivo marker for involvement of the peripheral nervous system in Fabry disease, even in patients with residual enzyme activity.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Purpose To investigate in vivo morphological and functional correlates of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXA-PNP) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Methods Twenty patients (7 female, 13 male, 58.9±10.0 years) with mild to moderate OXA-PNP and 20 matched controls (8 female, 12 male, 55.7±15.6 years) were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent a detailed neurophysiological examination prior to neuroimaging. A standardized imaging protocol at 3.0 Tesla included the lumbosacral plexus and both sciatic nerves and their branches using T2-weighted fat-saturated sequences and diffusion tensor imaging. Quantitative assessment included volumetry of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), sciatic nerve normalized T2 (nT2) signal and caliber, and fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). Additional qualitative evaluation of sciatic, peroneal, and tibial nerves evaluated the presence, degree, and distribution of nerve lesions. Results DRG hypertrophy in OXA-PNP patients (207.3±47.7mm3 vs. 153.0±47.1mm3 in controls, p = 0.001) was found as significant morphological correlate of the sensory neuronopathy. In contrast, peripheral nerves only exhibited minor morphological alterations qualitatively. Quantitatively, sciatic nerve caliber (27.3±6.7mm2 vs. 27.4±7.4mm2, p = 0.80) and nT2 signal were not significantly changed in patients (1.32±0.22 vs. 1.22±0.26, p = 0.16). AD, RD, and MD showed a non-significant decrease in patients, while FA was unchanged. Conclusion OXA-PNP manifests with morphological and functional correlates that can be detected in vivo by MRN. We report hypertrophy of the DRG that stands in contrast to experimental and postmortem studies. DRG volume should be further investigated as a biomarker in other sensory peripheral neuropathies and ganglionopathies. © 2017 Apostolidis et al.

N2  - Background and aims: There is now emerging evidence that diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is associated with both structural change and functional reorganization of the somatosensory cortex (SSC). We have previously demonstrated spinal cord atrophy and a reduction in grey matter volume in the primary SSC in DSPN but the integrity of the white matter tracks between these two anatomical areas has not been studied. In this study we have applied Magnetic Resonance (MR) Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to estimate cerebral water diffusion directionality which can be used to infer intracranial axonal tract architecture. Materials and methods: 11 type 1 diabetes patients (8 males, mean age 54.6+13.8 years) with DPN and 13 healthy volunteers (7 males, age 49.3+15.0 years) without diabetes underwent detailed clinical and neurophysiological assessments (NIS-LL+7 - confirming DPN). All subjects had DTI on MR at 3T (Achieva, Philips Healthcare) using a spin-echo, EPI-based 32-direction technique. Group mean fractional anisotropy maps were generated and compared. Results: We found significantly lower fractional anisotropy in the primary SSC (MNI coordinates: -32,-30,46), supramarginal gyrus (-28,-40,39) and corticospinal tract (-24,-17,36) in DSPN compared to the healthy volunteer group (p < 0.05). There were no regions where the fractional anisotropy was higher in the DPN compared to healthy volunteer group. Conclusion: This study for the first time has shown alterations in white matter water diffusion fractional anisotropy in patients with DPN. This finding implies disruption of white matter tract integrity of the sensory and motor pathways in the brain in DPN. Changes in the degree of white matter structure, as indexed by a decline in fractional anisotropy, might provide a bio-mechanical understanding of CNS involvement in DPN. Larger studies are now required with including a diabetic control group without DPN.

N2  - Spinal cord injuries (SCI) normally disrupt the long axonal tracts of the spinal cord and cause permanent neurological deficits, for which there is currently a lack of effective therapeutic methods. Biomaterial-based regenerative medicine is a pivotal strategy to induce axonal regeneration through delivery of biophysical and/or biochemical regulatory cues by biomaterials. We previously fabricated a hierarchically aligned fibrin hydrogel (AFG) that could promote neurogenic differentiation of stem cells in vitro and has been successfully applied for peripheral nerve and spinal cord regeneration in rats. In this study, AFG was used to repair a canine lumbar segment 2 hemisection spinal cord injury, and the consistency of histological, imageological and behavioral results was compared. AFG was used to construct an aligned fiber bridge that supported cell adhesion in vitro and rapidly facilitated tissue invasion along the long axis of fibers in vivo, Moreover, in vivo results demonstrated regrowth of axons in an oriented pattern connecting the rostral and caudal stumps. Consistent results were confirmed by diffusion tensor imaging, which allowed successful tracing of reconnected nerve fibers across the defect. As a result, directional axonal regrowth contributed to significantly improved recovery of motor functional behavior of SCI canines with AFG implantation. Our results suggest that AFG has great promise for rapidly directing axonal regrowth for nerve regeneration.

N2  - Electroacupuncture (EA) is an adjuvant therapy for peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Both peripheral and central alterations contribute to the rehabilitation process. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the diffusion plasticity of afferent and efferent pathways caused by EA in model of peripheral nerve injury and reparation. Twenty-four rats were divided into three groups: normal group, model group and intervention group. Rats of the model group and the intervention group underwent sciatic nerve transection and anastomosis. EA intervention was performed on the intervention group at ST-36 and GB-30 for three months. Gait assessment and DTI were conducted at days post-operative (DPO) 30, 60 and 90. We selected corticospinal tract, spinothalamic tract and internal capsule as regions of interest and analyzed diffusion metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD). FA values and RD values displayed significant differences or obvious tendency while AD values maintained a stable level. RD values displayed better indicative performance than FA in internal capsule. The intervention group presented significant correlation between RD values and Regularity Index (RI) during the intervention period. The effect of EA on peripheral nerve injury repairing rats appeared to be accelerated recovery process of sensory and motor neural pathway. We proposed that RD was a potential in vivo indicator for structural plasticity caused by EA and PNI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance neurography (DW-MRN) in the visualisation of extremity nerves in the wrist and palm. Methods: Thirty-two volunteers and 21 patients underwent imaging of the wrist and palm on a 3-T MR scanner. In all subjects, two radiologists evaluated the image quality on DW-MRN using a four-point grading scale. Kappa statistics were obtained for inter-observer performance. In volunteers, the chi-squared test was used to assess the differences in nerve visualisation on DW-MRN and axial fat-suppressed proton density weighted imaging (FS-PDWI). Results: In volunteers, the mean image quality scores for the median nerve (MN) and ulnar nerve (UN) were 3.71 ± 0.46 and 3.23 ± 0.67 for observer 1, and 3.70 ± 0.46 and 3.22 ± 0.71 for observer 2, respectively. The inter-observer agreement was excellent (k = 0.843) and good (k = 0.788), respectively. DW-MRN provided significantly improved visualisations of the second and the third common palmar digital nerves and three branches of UN compared with FS-PDWI (P < 0.05). In patients, the mean image quality scores for the two observers were 3.24 ± 0.62 and 3.10 ± 0.83, inter-observer performance was excellent (k = 0.842). Conclusions: DW-MRN is feasible for improved visualisation of extremity nerves and their lesions in the wrist and palm with adequate image quality, thereby providing a supplementary method to conventional MR imaging. Key points: • DW-MRN provides adequate image quality for wrist and palm neurography • DW-MRN performs similarly to FS-PDWI in nerve visualisation at the wrist • DW-MRN provides improved visualisation of small nerves in the palm • DW-MRN serves as a supplementary method to evaluate peripheral neuropathies. © 2016, European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) account for 5% of soft tissue
neoplasms and are responsible for a wide spectrum of morbidities ranging
from localized neuropathy to fulminant metastatic spread and death. MR
imaging represents the gold standard for identification of these
neoplasms, however, current anatomic MR imaging markers do not reliably
detect or differentiate benign and malignant lesions, and therefore,
biopsy or excision is required for definitive diagnosis.
Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) serves as a useful tool in the
evaluation and management of PNSTs by providing functional information
regarding the degree of diffusion, while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
aids in determining the directional information of predominant diffusion
and has been shown to be particularly useful for pre-operative planning
of these tumors by delineating healthy and pathologic fascicles. The
article focuses on these important neurogenic lesions, highlighting the
current utility of diffusion MR imaging and future directions including
computerized radiomic analysis.Key Points center dot Anatomic MRI is
moderately accurate in differentiating benign from malignant PNST.center
dot Diffusion tensor imaging facilitates pre-operative planning of PNSTs
by depicting neuropathy and tractography.center dot Radiomics will
likely augment current observer-based diagnostic criteria for PNSTs.

N2  - A novel magnetic resonance imaging approach, called diffusion-direction-dependent imaging (DDI), is introduced. Due to inherent anisotropic diffusion properties, peripheral nerves can be visualized on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The largest signal attenuation on DTI correlates with the direction of a nerve fiber, and the least signal attenuation correlates with the direction perpendicular to the nerve fiber. Since low signal-to-noise ratio is a concern in peripheral nerve DTI, we explored a new approach focusing on the perpendicular diffusion direction. A 36-gradient diffusion direction scheme was used. A mean expected curve specific for peripheral nerves was calculated based on the sciatic nerve and its division into the common peroneal nerve and the tibial nerve in three healthy volunteers. By a simple postprocessing method, a comparison of the mean expected curve and the measured curve was made voxel by voxel, and the sciatic nerve and its division were reconstructed, excluding other tissues. More studies are needed to investigate whether other postprocessing methods or other diffusion direction schemes are more suited for peripheral nerve imaging with DDI. Further studies may also be of interest to investigate whether DDI can be a complementary method to conventional T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences in the imaging of peripheral nerve pathology or even in the visualization of other tissues, possibly with different diffusion direction schemes. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - "Pure" adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is the noninflammatory myeloneuropathic variant of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, where the disease process appears to be restricted to spinal cord tracts and peripheral nerves. The absence of obvious brain involvement makes it distinct from the inflammatory cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. However, some pure AMN patients later experience development of cerebral demyelination, but little is known about die extent of brain involvement in pure AMN patients who have normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. We used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate possible occult cerebral abnormalities in such pure AMN patients. Fractional anisotropy and trace were studied in three-dimensional reconstructions of white matter tracts commonly involved in cerebral phenotypes of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Results demonstrated reduced fractional anisotropy and increased trace in bilateral corticospinal tracts and genu of corpus callosum (p < 0.05). Diffusion tensor imaging-based three-dimensional fiber tracking showed occult tract-specific cerebral microstructural abnormalities in pure AMN patients who had a normal conventional brain magnetic resonance image. Corticospinal tract abnormalities could reflect a centripetal extension of spinal cord long-tract distal axonopathy. Accompanying abnormalities in genu of corpus callosum indicate that the disease pathology in pure AMN may not be limited to spinal cord long tracts alone, although the involvement of the latter is most prominent and severe. © 2005 American Neurological Association.

N2  - Background: Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that a magnetic resonance imaging method called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can differentiate between crush and complete transection peripheral nerve injuries in a rat model ex vivo. DTI measures the directionally dependent effect of tissue barriers on the random diffusion of water molecules. In ordered tissues such as nerves, this information can be used to reconstruct the primary direction of diffusion along fiber tracts, which may provide information on fiber tract continuity after nerve injury and surgical repair. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with different degrees of partial transection of the sciatic nerve followed by immediate repair and euthanized after 1 week of recovery. Nerves were then harvested, fixed, and scanned with a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging to obtain DTIand fiber tractography in each sample. Additional behavioral (sciatic function index, foot fault asymmetry) and histological (Toluidine blue staining) assessments were performed for validation. Results: Tractography yielded a visual representation of the degree of injury that correlated with behavioral and histological evaluations. Conclusions: DTI tractography is a noninvasive tool that can yield a visual representation of a partial nerve transection as early as 1 week after surgical repair. © 2020 The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.

N2  - Object Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) are uncommon but bear a significant risk of malignancy. High-resolution MRI is the standard technique for characterizing PNSTs. However, planning the appropriate extent of resection and subsequent reconstructive strategies is highly dependent on the intraoperative findings because preoperative MRI evaluation can be insufficient. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) represents a recently developed advanced MRI technique that reveals the microstructure of tissues based on monitoring the random movement of water molecules. DTT has the potential to provide diagnostic insights beyond conventional MRI techniques due to its mapping of specific fibrillar nerve structures. Here, DTT was applied to evaluate PNSTs and to examine the usefulness of this method for the correct delineation of tumor and healthy nerve tissue and the value of this information in the preoperative planning of surgical interventions. Met hods In this prospective study, patients with the clinical symptoms of a PNST were investigated using DTT 3-Tesla MRI scans. Image data processing and tractography were performed using the FACT (fiber assessment by continuous tracking) algorithm and multiple-regions-of-interest approach. The surgical findings were then compared with the results of the DTT MRI scans. Preoperative fascicle visualization and the correlation with the intraoperative findings were graded. Res ults In a 21-month period, 12 patients with PNSTs were investigated (7 female and 5 male patients with a mean age of 46.2 ± 19.2 years). All patients underwent surgical removal of the tumor. Schwannoma was the most common benign histopathological finding (n = 7), whereas 2 malignant lesions were detected. In 10 of 12 patients, good preoperative nerve fascicle visualization was achieved using DTT scans. In 9 of 10 patients with good preoperative fascicle visualization, good intraoperative correlation between the DTT scans and surgical anatomy was found. Con clusions DTT properly visualizes the peripheral nerve fascicles and their correct anatomical relation to PNST. DTT represents a promising new method for the preinterventional planning of nerve tumor resection. © AANS, 2015.

N2  - Krabbe's disease is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder resulting from deficiency of β-galactocerebrosidase that affects primarily cerebral white matter and peripheral nerves. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to changes in white matter myelination, but its assessment is based purely on qualitative, visual inspection, and it is subject to interobserver variability and open to reader bias. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced MRI technique that provides quantitative information about the microscopic structural organization of the white matter and changes in cell density and myelination, and it is a suitable MRI tool for studying Krabbe's disease. This Review discusses the available studies on the application of quantitative DTI analysis to assess white matter changes in patients with Krabbe's disease. Quantitative analysis of DTI scalars, especially radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, has been shown to be a sensitive in vivo biomarker of white matter microstructural damage in Krabbe's disease, to detect early white matter injury in asymptomatic neonates with Krabbe's disease, to predict motor and cognitive functions after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and to serve as a measurement for monitoring effects of HSCT on white matter development in Krabbe's disease. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Successful management of peripheral nerve trauma relies on accurate localization of the injury and grading of the severity of nerve injury to determine whether surgical intervention is required. Existing techniques, such as electrodiagnostic studies and conventional imaging modalities, provide important information, but are limited by being unable to distinguish severe nerve lesions in continuity that will recover from those that will not. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of peripheral nerves provide a novel technique to localize and grade nerve injury, by assessing the integrity of the nerve fibers across the site of nerve injury. Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography also hold promise as markers of early nerve regeneration, prior to clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of recovery. In the present review, the techniques of peripheral nerve DTI and tractography are discussed with respect to peripheral nerve trauma, with illustrative cases demonstrating potential roles of these novel approaches. © AANS, 2015.

N2  - Development of outcome measures to assess ongoing nerve regeneration in the living animal that can be translated to human can provide extremely useful tools for monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions to promote nerve regeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance based technique, provides image contrast for nerve tracts and can be applied serially on the same subject with potential to monitor nerve fiber content. In this study, we examined the use of ex vivo high-resolution DTI for imaging intact and regenerating peripheral nerves in mice and correlated the MRI findings with electrophysiology and histology. DTI was done on sciatic nerves with crush, without crush, and after complete transection in different mouse strains. DTI measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA), parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity were acquired and compared in segments of uninjured and crushed/transected nerves and correlated with morphometry. A comparison of axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush showed a comparable pattern of regeneration in different mice strains. FA values were significantly lower in completely denervated nerve segments compared to uninjured sciatic nerve and this signal was restored toward normal in regenerating nerve segments (crushed nerves). Histology data indicate that the FA values and the parallel diffusivity showed a positive correlation with the total number of regenerating axons. These studies suggest that DTI is a sensitive measure of axon regeneration in mouse models and provide basis for further development of imaging technology for application to living animals and humans. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: The development of a noninvasive, objective, and accurate method to assess peripheral nerve disorders in Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS) is of clinical significance. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to evaluate some peripheral nerve disorders. Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of DTI in evaluating the peripheral nerve disorders in patients with GBS. Study Type: Case control. Subjects: Twenty GBS patients and 16 healthy volunteers. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T, T 1 WI-SE, T 2 WI-SPAIR, DTI; electrophysiology. Assessment: MRI data were analyzed by two radiologists blindly and independently. Fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), axial diffusion coefficient (AD), and radial diffusion coefficient (RD) values of tibial nerve (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were recorded. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) and motor nerve conduction amplitude of TN and CPN were recorded. Statistical Tests: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), t-test, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC) analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: The FA and AD values of TN and CPN in the GBS group were significantly lower and the ADC and RD values were higher than those in the controls (P &lt;0.05). The AUC of the FA values (0.970 for TN and 0.927 for CPN) were higher than that of the ADC, AD, and RD values. FA and AD values were positively correlated and ADC, RD values were negatively correlated with MCV and motor nerve conduction amplitude, respectively (P &lt;0.05). The correlations between FA value and electrophysiology parameters were the highest. Data Conclusion: DTI quantitative parameters could evaluate the disorders of peripheral nerves in patients with GBS. A moderate correlation was observed between DTI and electrophysiology parameters.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nerve damage in diabetic neuropathy (DN) is assumed to begin in the  distal legs with a subsequent progression to hands and arms at later stages. In contrast, recent studies have found that lower limb nerve lesions in DN predominate at the proximal sciatic nerve and that, in the upper limb, nerve functions can be impaired at early stages of DN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single-center cross-sectional study, participants underwent diffusion-weighted 3 Tesla magnetic resonance neurography in order to calculate the sciatic nerve's fractional anisotropy (FA), a surrogate parameter for structural nerve integrity. Results were correlated with clinical and electrophysiological assessments of the lower limb and an examination of hand function derived from the Purdue Pegboard Test. RESULTS: Overall, 71 patients with diabetes, 11 patients with prediabetes and 25 age-matched control subjects took part in this study. In patients with diabetes, the sciatic nerve's FA showed positive correlations with tibial and peroneal nerve conduction velocities (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and r = 0.56; p < 0.001, respectively), and tibial and peroneal nerve compound motor action potentials (r = 0.62; p < 0.001 and r = 0.63; p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the sciatic nerve's FA was correlated with the Pegboard Test results in patients with diabetes (r = 0.52; p < 0.001), prediabetes (r = 0.76; p < 0.001) and in controls (r = 0.79; p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that the sciatic nerve's FA is a surrogate marker for functional and electrophysiological parameters of both upper and lower limbs in patients with diabetes and prediabetes, suggesting that nerve damage in these patients is not restricted to the level of the symptomatic limbs but rather affects the entire peripheral nervous system.

N2  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) characterises tissue microstructure and provides proxy measures of myelination, axon diameter, fibre density and organisation. This may be valuable in the assessment of the roots of the brachial plexus in health and disease. Therefore, there is a need to define the normal DTI values. Methods: The literature was systematically searched for studies of asymptomatic adults who underwent DTI of the brachial plexus. Participant characteristics, scanning protocols, and measurements of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of each spinal root were extracted by two independent review authors. Generalised linear modelling was used to estimate the effect of experimental conditions on the FA and MD. Meta-analysis of root-level estimates was performed using Cohen’s method with random effects. Results: Nine articles, describing 316 adults (1:1 male:female) of mean age 35 years (SD 6) were included. Increments of ten diffusion sensitising gradient directions reduced the mean FA by 0.01 (95% CI 0.01, 0.03). Each year of life reduced the mean MD by 0.03 × 10–3 mm2/s (95% CI 0.01, 0.04). At 3-T, the pooled mean FA of the roots was 0.36 (95% CI 0.34, 0.38; I2 98%). The pooled mean MD of the roots was 1.51 × 10–3 mm2/s (95% CI 1.45, 1.56; I2 99%). Conclusions: The FA and MD of the roots of the brachial plexus vary according to experimental conditions and participant factors. We provide summary estimates of the normative values in different conditions which may be valuable to researchers and clinicians alike. © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: To assess the agreement of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the median nerve on 3.0 T MR scanners from different vendors. Materials and methods: IRB approved study including 16 healthy volunteers (9 women; mean age 30.6 ± 5.3 years). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the dominant wrist was performed on three 3.0 T MR scanners (GE, Siemens, Philips) using similar imaging protocols and vendor-proprietary hard- and software. Intra-, inter-reader and inter-vendor agreements were assessed. Results: ICCs for intra-/inter-reader agreements ranged from 0.843-0.970/0.846-0.956 for FA, and 0.840-0.940/0.726-0.929 for ADC, respectively. ANOVA analysis identified significant differences for FA/ADC measurements among vendors (p &lt; 0.001/p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Overall mean values for FA were 0.63 (SD ± 0.1) and 0.999 × 10 -3mm2/s (SD ± 0.134 × 10-3) for ADC. A significant negative measurement bias was found for FA values from the GE scanner (-0.05 and -0.07) and for ADC values from the Siemens scanner (-0.053 and -0.063 × 10-3mm2/s) as compared to the remainder vendors Conclusion: FA and ADC values of the median nerve obtained on different 3.0 T MR scanners differ significantly, but are in comparison to the standard deviation of absolute values small enough to not have an impact on larger group studies or when substantial diffusion changes can be expected. However, caution is warranted in an individual patient when interpreting diffusion values from different scanner acquisitions. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can provide structural information and objective values for nerves. The aims of this study were to perform quantitative evaluation and fibre tracking of the normal inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) using DTI on 3.0-T MRI. Methods: DTI was applied to 92 IANs of 46 healthy volunteers. Circular regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on three different positions at the mandibular foramen, second molar and mental foramen of each nerve on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and the ADC and FA of each ROI were measured. Differences in the values arising from the nerve positions were evaluated. Furthermore, fibre tracking of the IANs was performed by tractography, and the quality of visualization was evaluated. Results: There were no significant differences in the ADC and FA between the right and left sides regardless of the anteroposterior positions. Regarding differences arising from the anteroposterior measurement positions, the ADC and FA showed no significant differences (p > 0.017), except for the ADCs between the positions at the mandibular foramen and mental foramen in the left side (p = 0.0068). Overall, 70 (76%) of the 92 IANs could be visualized fully or partially by tractography. Conclusions: The ADC and FA of the IAN were successfully obtained from healthy volunteers using DTI and were confirmed to be symmetrical regardless of the measurement positions. DTI is a feasible technique for the quantitative evaluation and visualization of the IAN. © 2016 The Authors. Published by the British Institute of Radiology.

N2  - Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) adds functional information to morphological magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in the assessment of the brachial nerve plexus. To determine the most appropriate pulse sequence in scan times suited for diagnostic imaging in clinical routine, we compared image quality between simultaneous multi-slice readout-segmented (rs-DTI) and conventional single-shot (ss-DTI) echo-planar imaging techniques. Methods: Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved study including 10 healthy volunteers. The supraclavicular brachial plexus, covering the nerve roots and trunks from C5 to C7, was imaged on both sides with rs-DTI and ss-DTI. Both sequences were acquired in scan times <7 min with b-values of 900 s/mm2 and with isotropic spatial resolution. Results: In rs-DTI image, the overall quality was significantly better and distortion artifacts were significantly lower (P = 0.001-0.002 and P = 0.001-0.002, respectively) for both readers. In ss-DTI, a trend toward lower degree of ghosting and motion artifacts was elicited (reader 1, P = 0.121; reader 2, P = 0.264). No significant differences between the two DTI techniques were found for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), contrast- to-noise ratios (CNR) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (P ≥ 0.475, P ≥ 0.624, and P ≥ 0.169, respectively). Interreader agreement for all examined parameters and all sequences ranged from intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.064 to 0.905 and Kappa 0.40 to 0.851. Conclusion: Incomparable acquisition times rs-DTI showed higher image quality and less distortion artifacts than ss-DTI. The trend toward a higher degree of ghosting and motion artifacts in rs-DTI did not deteriorate image quality to a significant degree. Thus, rs-DTI should be considered for functional MRN of the brachial plexus. © 2018 Japanese Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

N2  - Purpose: Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is seen in up to 75% of treated cancer patients and can drastically limit their medical management and affect quality of life. Clinical and electrodiagnostic testing for CIPN have many pitfalls. Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is being increasingly used in the evaluation of peripheral nerves. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) shows promise in the workup of peripheral nerves. In this prospective pilot study, we investigated a possible relationship between DTI and peripheral neuropathy of the ankle and foot in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Methods: Nine cancer patients with and without CIPN were clinically evaluated using vibratory perception threshold (VPT) testing. VPT score of >25 Volts defined presence of CIPN. The posterior tibial nerve and branches in both feet were imaged using MRN and DTI. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured at the posterior tibial, medial plantar, and lateral plantar nerves. Measurements for the CIPN group were compared to without CIPN by VPT cutoff. Correlations and possible relationships between DTI parameters and CIPN were analyzed. Results: A total of 16 feet of 9 enrolled patients were imaged (9 feet with CIPN and 7 feet without CIPN). Average age was 60.6 ± 13.4 years (range: 33-74). Posterior tibial nerve ADC values were significantly lower than the medial plantar nerve ADC values in all feet (F = 3.50, P = 0.04). We found a correlation with FA and ADC values at specific nerve locations with CIPN, with the left medial plantar nerve FA value and left lateral plantar nerve ADC value demonstrating the strongest positive correlations (0.73 and 0.62, respectively). Conclusions: The use of DTI for assessing CIPN is challenging but promising. This pilot study provides preliminary data showing correlations between FA and ADC measurements with CIPN and potential utility of DTI as a predictive marker of onset and severity of CIPN in the ankle and foot, which could aid in preventive strategies. Larger, prospective DTI studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions. Clinical Relevance: MRN with DTI shows promising results as a potential predictive marker of CIPN in the ankle and foot. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) for the detection of neuropathy in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A). Background: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is diagnosed based on clinical examination, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and genetic analysis. NCS is the golden standard for evaluation of peripheral neuropathies, however, the nerves may be inexcitable and the degree of severity is difficult to assess more precisely. These factors underscore the need for sensitive methods to determine the presence and severity of neuropathy in CMT. Design/Methods: MRN was performed in proximal and distal nerve segments of the lower extremity (sciatic and tibial nerve) in 15 patients with CMT1A and 30 healthy controls (HC). MRN consisted of conventional MR imaging to calculate T2-relaxation-time (T2) and proton-spin-density (PD) and diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) to determine fractional-anisotropy (FA) and the apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC). The findings at MRN were related to neuropathy severity based on clinical examinations and nerve conduction studies. Sensitivity and specificity of MRN was estimated from receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Results: In CMT1A patients, as compared to HC, DTI of the sciatic nerve showed lower FA values (HC: 0.49±0.06; CMT1A: 0.36±0.07) (p<0.01) and higher ADC values (HC: 1.42±0.12 × 10-3mm2/s; CMT1A: 1.67±0.20 × 10-3mm2/s) (p< 0.01). Similar findings were seen for the tibial nerve with lower FA values (p<0.01) and higher ADC values (p<0.01). Conventional T2 showed no difference, however, the PD of the sciatic nerve was higher in the patient group (HC: 381±80; CMT1A: 545±101) (p<0.01). There were close associations between neuropathy severity and MRN with the closest correlation between FA and nerve conduction velocity in the sciatic nerve (R2=0.58; p<0.01). ROC analyses showed good separation of CMT1A and HC. Conclusions: MRN examination enables detection of neuropathic abnormalities in patients with CMT1A and may prove to be a responsive measure for monitoring of the neuropathy.

N2  - Purpose: While standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are increasingly employed in post-mortem (PM) examinations, more advanced techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) remain unexplored in forensic sciences. Therefore, we studied the temporal stability and reproducibility of DTI and fiber tractography (FT) in non-fixed PM subjects. In addition, we investigated the lumbosacral nerves with PMDTI and compared their tissue characteristics to in vivo findings. Methods: MRI data were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner in seven PM subjects, consisting of six non-trauma deaths and one chronic trauma death, and in six living subjects. Inter-scan (within one session) and inter-session (between days) reproducibility of diffusion parameters, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD), were evaluated for the lumbosacral nerves using Bland-Altman and Jones plots. Diffusion parameters in nerves L3-S2 were compared to living subjects using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Reproducibility of diffusion values of inter-scan 95% limits of agreement ranged from -0.058 to 0.062 for FA, and (-0.037 to 0.052) × 10-3 mm2/s for MD. For the inter-session this was -0.0423 to 0.0423, and (-0.0442 to 0.0442) × 10-3 mm2/s for FA, and MD, respectively. Although PM subjects showed approximately four-fold lower diffusivity values compared to living subjects, FT results were comparable. The chronic trauma case showed disorganization and asymmetry of the nerves. Conclusion: We demonstrated that DTI was reproducible in characterizing nervous tissue properties and FT in reconstructing the architecture of lumbosacral nerves in PM subjects. We showed differences in diffusion values between PM and in vivo and showed the ability of PMDTI and FT to reconstruct nerve lesions in a chronic trauma case. We expect that PMDTI and FT may become valuable in identification and documentation of PM nerve trauma or pathologies in forensic sciences. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a powerful MR imaging technique that can be used to probe the microstructural environment of highly anisotropic tissues such as peripheral nerves. DTI has been used predominantly in the central nervous system, and its application in the peripheral nervous system does pose some challenges related to imaging artifacts, the small caliber of peripheral nerves, and low water proton density. However advances in MRI hardware and software have made it possible to use the technique in the peripheral nervous system and to obtain functional data relating to the effect of pathologic processes on peripheral nerves. This article reviews the imaging principles behind DTI and examines the literature regarding its application in assessing peripheral nerves. © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows the directional dependence of water diffusion to be studied. Analysis of the resulting image data allows for the determination of fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), as well as allowing three-dimensional visualization of the fiber tract (tractography). We visualized the ulnar nerve of ten healthy volunteers with DTI. We found FA to be 0.752 ±0.067 and the ADC to be 0.96 ± 0.13×10-3 mm2/s. A nuts-and-bolts description of the physical aspects of DTI is provided as an educational process for readers. © 2010 ISS.

N2  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for the evaluation of peripheral nerves in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Methods: Using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, we obtained DTI scans of the tibial nerves of 10 CIDP patients and 10 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. We prepared fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, measured the FA values of tibial nerves, and compared these values in the two study groups. In nine patients, we also performed tibial nerve conduction studies and analyzed the correlation between the FA values and parameters of the nerve conduction study. Results: The tibial nerve FA values in CIDP patients (median 0.401, range 0.312-0.510) were significantly lower than those in healthy volunteers (median 0.530, range 0.469-0.647) (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.01). They were significantly correlated with the amplitude of action potential (Spearman correlation coefficient, p=0.04, r=0.86) but not with nerve conduction velocity (p=0.79, r=0.11). Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that the noninvasive DTI assessment of peripheral nerves may provide useful information in patients with CIDP. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the quality of recently emerged advanced diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques with conventional single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) in a functional assessment of lumbar nerve roots. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved the study including 12 healthy volunteers. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed at 3 T (MAGNETOM Skyra; Siemens Healthcare) with b-values of 0 and 700 s/mm2 and an isotropic spatial resolution for subsequent multiplanar reformatting. The nerve roots L2 to S1 were imaged in coronal orientation with readout-segmented EPI (rs-DTI) and selective-excitation EPI (sTX-DTI) with an acquisition time of 5 minutes each, and in axial orientation with single-shot EPI (ss-DTI) with an acquisition time of 12 minutes (scan parameters as in recent literature). Two independent readers qualitatively and quantitatively assessed image quality. Result(s): The interobserver reliability ranged from "substantial" to "almost perfect" for all examined parameter and all 3 sequences (kappa = 0.70-0.94). Overall image quality was rated higher, and artifact levels were scored lower for rs-DTI and sTX-DTI than for ss-DTI (P = 0.007-0.027), while fractional anisotropy and signal-to-noise ratio values were similar for all sequences (P >= 0.306 and P >= 0.100, respectively). Contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly higher for rs-DTI and ss-DTI than for sTX-DTI (P = 0.004-0.013). Conclusion(s): Despite shorter acquisition times, rs-DTI and sTX-DTI produced images of higher quality with smaller geometrical distortions than the current standard of reference, ss-DTI. Thus, DTI acquisitions in the coronal plane, requiring fewer slices for full coverage of exiting nerve roots, may allow for functional neurography in scan times suitable for routine clinical practice.Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To implement a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol for visualization of peripheral nerves in human forearm. Materials and Methods: This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from 10 healthy participants. T1- and T2-weighted turbo spin echo with fat saturation, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and DTI sequences with 21 diffusion-encoding directions were implemented to acquire images of the forearm nerves with an 8 channel knee coil on a 3T MRI scanner. Identification of the nerves was based on T1-weighted, T 2-weighted, STIR, and DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) images. Maps of the DTI-derived indices, FA, mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal diffusivity (λ//), and radial diffusivity (λ; ⊥) along the length of the nerves were generated. Results: DTI-derived maps delineated the forearm nerves more clearly than images acquired with other sequences. Only ulnar and median nerves were clearly visualized on the DTI-derived FA maps. No significant differences were observed between the left and right forearms in any of the DTI-derived measures. Significant variation in the DTI measures was observed along the length of the nerve. Significant differences in the DTI measures were also observed between the median and ulnar nerves. Conclusion: DTI is superior in visualizing the median and ulnar nerves in the human forearm. The normative data could potentially help distinguish normal from diseased nerves. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Presently, the most reliable methods for peripheral nerve repair depend on microsutures, nerve conduits, and/or autologous nerve grafts. However, even with these techniques functional recovery depends on a lengthy process that involves axonal outgrowth, which occurs at a rate of 1-3 mm/day. Polyethylene-glycol (PEG) has proven the ability to improve behavioral outcomes in animal models immediately following nerve transection. We hypothesized that this technique could restore axonal continuity as assessed by high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging. Methods: Bilateral rat sciatic nerves were transected and repaired in 6 animals using standard microsurgical techniques. Experimental animals received Plasmalyte-A, 1% methylene blue, PEG, and Lactated Ringers; control animals did not receive PEG. Electrophysiological recordings were acquired pre-injury and post-repair. High-resolution diffusion tensor images were obtained using diffusion-weighted spin-echo acquisitions at 4.7-tesla. Results: We found that PEG-fused nerves had restored axonal continuity immediately following application of PEG. 83% (5/6) of PEG-fused nerves had restored compound action potential (CAP) function, while 0% (0/6) of control animals showed returned CAP function. Additionally, diffusion tensor tractography displayed a significantly increased (p<0.01) number of axonal tracts through the repair site in PEG-fused nerves. Furthermore, fractional anisotropy was increased at the injury sites of PEG-fused nerves compared to control nerves. Conclusions: These findings suggest that PEG-fused nerves immediately restore axonal continuity. We believe that this novel nerve fusion technique may produce a change in the clinical management of traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves. Additionally, high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging is a promising tool for future diagnosis and tracking of traumatic nerve injuries.

N2  - PURPOSE To evaluate if diffusion tensor imaging MR neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect lesions of peripheral nerves in patients with type 1 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eleven type 1 diabetic patients with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 type 1 diabetic patients without polyneuropathy (nDPN), and 10 healthy controls (HC) were investigated with a 3T MRI scanner. Clinical examinations, nerve-conduction studies, and vibratory-perception thresholds determined the presence of DPN. DTI-MRN (voxel size: 1.4 × 1.4 × 3 mm3; b-values: 0, 800 s/mm2) covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions of the lower extremity (tibial nerve). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated and compared to T2-relaxometry and proton-spin density obtained from a multiecho turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated DTI reproducibility, repeatability, and diagnostic accuracy RESULTS DTI-MRN could accurately discriminate between DPN, nDPN, and HC. The proximal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 0.37 ± 0.06; nDPN 0.47 ± 0.03; HC 0.49 ± 0.06; P < 0.01). In addition, distal FA was lowest in DPN (DPN 0.31 ± 0.05; nDPN 0.41 ± 0.07; HC 0.43 ± 0.08; P < 0.01). Likewise, proximal ADC was highest in DPN (DPN 1.69 ± 0.25 × 10-3mm2/s; nDPN 1.50 ± 0.06 × 10-3mm2/s; HC 1.42 ± 0.12 × 10-3mm2/s; P < 0.01) as was distal ADC (DPN 1.87 ± 0.45 × 10-3mm2/s; nDPN 1.59 ± 0.19 × 10-3mm2/s; HC 1.57 ± 0.26 × 10-3mm2/s; P = 0.09). The combined interclass-correlation (ICC) coefficient of DTI reproducibility and repeatability was high in the sciatic nerve (ICC: FA = 0.86; ADC = 0.85) and the tibial nerve (ICC: FA = 0.78; ADC = 0.66). T2-relaxometry and proton-spin-density did not enable detection of neuropathy. CONCLUSION DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher ADC. These alterations are likely to reflect proximal and distal nerve fiber pathology.

N2  - Aim: To evaluate if diffusion-tensor-imaging MR-Neurography (DTI-MRN) can detect lesions of peripheral nerves due to polyneuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Ten patients with type 2 diabetes with polyneuropathy (DPN), 10 patients with type 2 diabetes without polyneuropathy (nDPN) as well as 20 healthy controls (HC) were included. DTI-MRN covered proximal (sciatic nerve) and distal regions (tibial nerve) of the lower extremity. Fractional-anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity (mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD)) were calculated and compared to neuropathy severity. Conventional T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density data were obtained from a multi-echo SE sequence. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity and specificity of DTI-MRN from receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Results: The proximal and distal FA was lowest in patients with DPN compared with nDPN and HC (p < 0.01). Likewise, proximal and distal RD was highest in patients with DPN (p < 0.01). MD and AD were also significantly different though less pronounced. ROC curve analyses of DTI separated nDPN and DPN with area-under-the-curve values ranging from 0.65 to 0.98. T2-relaxation-time and proton-spin-density could not differentiate between nDPN and DPN. Conclusion: DTI-MRN accurately detects DPN by lower nerve FA and higher RD. These alterations are likely to reflect both proximal and distal nerve fiber pathology in patients with type 2 diabetes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established imaging modality which is used in all districts of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems. More recently, initial studies have applied multiparametric MRI to evaluate quantitatively different aspects of musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve diseases, thus providing not only images but also numbers and clinical data. Besides 1H and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a relatively new MRI-based technique relying on principles of DWI, which has traditionally been used mainly for evaluating the central nervous system to track fibre course. In the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems, DTI has been mostly used in experimental settings, with still few indications in clinical practice. In this review, we describe the potential use of DTI to evaluate different musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve conditions, emphasising the translational aspects of this technique from the experimental to the clinical setting. © 2017, The Author(s).

N2  - Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging is an emerging magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique for evaluating the microstructure of well-organized biologic tissues such as muscles and nerves. DT imaging provides information about tissue microstructure by producing three-dimensional maps of water molecule movements. The two main parameters of measurement at DT imaging, fractional anisotropy and the apparent diffusion coefficient, allow quantitation of architectural changes occurring in tissue. These parameters are modified in the presence of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, cervical spine trauma, carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar nerve compression, peripheral nerve tumors, and muscle ischemia. Their alteration may be observed at DT imaging even when no abnormality is seen at conventional MR imaging, a fact that suggests that DT imaging allows the detection of abnormalities at an earlier stage of injury. Experimental studies in animals have shown that DT imaging consistently allows identification of pathophysiologic alterations in tissue that correlate with histologic findings. Tractographic images accurately depict both normal and abnormal diffusion in anatomic structures such as the thigh and pelvic muscles, cervical spine, and lumbar nerves. Patients with chronic diseases also may benefit from follow-up evaluation with DT imaging, although DT imaging sequences must be further adapted to improve the evaluation of specific anatomic regions by reducing artifacts, optimizing spatial resolution, and minimizing acquisition time. Given its proven potential for use in identifying abnormalities that are otherwise identifiable only with electrophysiologic and histopathologic studies, and with future technical improvements, DT imaging could soon become a standard method for early diagnosis, management, and follow-up of disease in the spine, muscles, and peripheral nerves.Copyright RSNA, 2014

N2  - Purpose: By applying diffusor tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with anterior interosseous nerve syndrome (AINS), this proof of principle study aims to quantify the extent of structural damage of a peripheral nerve at the anatomical level of individual fascicles. Methods: In this institutional review board approved prospective study 13 patients with spontaneous AINS were examined at 3 Tesla including a transversal T2-weighted turbo-spin-echo and a spin-echo echo-planar-imaging pulse sequence of the upper arm level. Calculations of quantitative DTI parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) for median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles as well as ulnar and radial nerve were obtained. DTI values were compared to each other and to a previously published dataset of 58 healthy controls using one-way Analysis of Variance with Bonferroni correction and p-values <.05 were considered significant. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to assess diagnostic accuracy. Results: FA of median nerve lesion fascicles was decreased compared to median nerve non-lesion fascicles, ulnar nerve and radial nerve while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p <.001 for all parameters). Compared to median nerve values of healthy controls, lesion fascicles showed a significant decrease in FA while MD, RD, and AD was increased (p <.001 for all parameters). FA of median nerve non-lesion fascicles showed a weak significant decrease compared to healthy controls (p <.01) while there was no difference in MD, RD, and AD. ROC analyses revealed an excellent diagnostic accuracy of FA, MD and RD in the discrimination of median nerve lesion and non-lesion fascicles in AINS patients as well as in the discrimination of lesion fascicles and normative median nerve values of healthy controls. Conclusion: By applying this functional MR Neurography technique in patients with AINS, this proof of principle study demonstrates that diffusion tensor imaging is feasible to quantify structural nerve injury at the anatomical level of individual fascicles. © 2019 The Authors

N2  - Cross-sectional MRI has modest diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing traumatic brachial plexus root avulsions. Consequently, patients either undergo major exploratory surgery or months of surveillance to determine if and what nerve reconstruction is needed. This study aimed to develop a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol at 3 Tesla to visualize normal roots and identify traumatic root avulsions of the brachial plexus. Seven healthy adults and 12 adults with known (operatively explored) unilateral traumatic brachial plexus root avulsions were scanned. DTI was acquired using a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence at 3 Tesla. The brachial plexus was visualized by deterministic tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated for injured and avulsed roots in the lateral recesses of the vertebral foramen. Compared to healthy nerves roots, the FA of avulsed nerve roots was lower (mean difference 0.1 [95% CI 0.07, 0.13]; p &lt; 0.001) and the MD was greater (mean difference 0.32 × 10−3 mm2/s [95% CI 0.11, 0.53]; p &lt; 0.001). Deterministic tractography reconstructed both normal roots and root avulsions of the brachial plexus; the negative-predictive value for at least one root avulsion was 100% (95% CI 78, 100). Therefore, DTI might help visualize both normal and injured roots of the brachial plexus aided by tractography. The precision of this technique and how it relates to neural microstructure will be further investigated in a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of patients with acute brachial plexus injuries. © Copyright © 2020 Wade, Tanner, Teh, Ridgway, Shelley, Chaka, Rankine, Andersson, Wiberg and Bourke.

N2  - Various neurological problems of the brain are known to occur in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings in patients with ESRD. Using DTI, we attempted to investigate DTI findings in patients with ESRD who showed no specific lesions on conventional brain MRI. We recruited 10 consecutive patients with ESRD for whom at least 3 years had passed since the start of peritoneal dialysis and who showed no neurological abnormality on neurologic examination. We excluded 6 patients who showed cerebral infarct (4 patients) and diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy (2 patients); finally, 4 patients (39.75 +/- 9.84 years) were included in this study. We evaluated hand motor function and cognition. DTI data were acquired using a 1.5-T Philips Gyroscan Intera system and diffusion tensor tractographies (DTTs) for five neural tracts (corticospinal tract, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus) were evaluated. With the exception of 1 patient who revealed a mild abnormality at a higher cognitive function, no abnormalities in motor and cognitive function were observed. Among the 10 DTTs, except for those of the corticospinal tract, all 4 patients had more than one lesion. Patients with ESRD showed abnormalities on DTTs that were associated with cognition; however, they did not show significant cognitive abnormalities. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Globoid cell leukodystrophy is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase. In both human patients and the authentic murine Twitcher model, pathological findings include demyelination as well as axonal damage in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has emerged as a powerful noninvasive technique that is sensitive to these white matter disease processes. Increases in radial diffusivity (λ⊥) and decreases in axial diffusivity (λ∥) correlate with histopathological evidence of demyelination and axonal damage, respectively. Compared to age-matched, normal littermates, DTI of optic nerve and trigeminal nerve in end-stage Twitcher mice displayed a statistically significant increase in λ⊥ and decrease in λ∥, consistent with previously characterized demyelination and axonal damage in these regions. In the Twitcher spinal cord, a statistically significant decrease in λ∥ was identified in both the dorsal and ventrolateral white matter, relative to normal controls. These results were consistent with immunofluorescence evidence of axonal damage in these areas as detected by staining for nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI32). Increase in λ⊥ in Twitcher spinal cord white matter relative to normal controls reached statistical significance in the dorsal columns and approached statistical significance in the ventrolateral region. Correlative reduced levels of myelin basic protein were detected by immunofluorescent staining in both these white matter regions in the Twitcher spinal cord. Fractional anisotropy, a nonspecific but sensitive indicator of white matter disease, was significantly reduced in the optic nerve, trigeminal nerve, and throughout the spinal cord white matter of Twitcher mice, relative to normal controls. This first reported application of spinal cord DTI in the setting of GLD holds potential as a noninvasive, quantitative assay of therapeutic efficacy in future treatment studies.

N2  - Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown that fractional anisotropy (FA) is lower in peripheral nerves in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). We examined whether DTI correlates to muscle strength or impairment. Methods: MRI of sciatic and tibial nerves was performed on 3-T MR scanner by obtaining T2- and DTI-weighted sequences with fat saturation. On each slice of T2-weighted (T2w) and DTI, the tibial and sciatic nerves were segmented and served for calculation of signal intensity. On DTI images, pixel-by-pixel calculation of FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was done. Muscle strength at knee and ankle was determined by isokinetic dynamometry and severity of CIDP by neuropathy impairment score (NIS). Results: Fourteen CIDP patients treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin were compared to gender- and age-matched controls. T2w values expressed as a nerve/muscle ratio (nT2w) were unchanged in CIDP versus controls 0.93 ± 0.21 versus 1.02 ± 0.21 (P = 0.10). FA values were lower in CIDP compared to controls 0.38 ± 0.07 versus 0.45 ± 0.05 (P &lt; 0.0001), and ADC values were higher in CIDP versus controls 1735 ± 232 versus 1593 ± 116 × 10−6 mm2/s (P = 0.005). In CIDP, FA values correlated to clinical impairment (NIS) (r = −0.57, P = 0.03), but not to muscle strength. FA value in the sciatic nerve distinguishes CIDP from controls with a sensitivity and a specificity of 92.9 %. Conclusion: CIDP patients have unchanged nT2w values, lower FA values, and higher ADC values of sciatic and tibial nerves compared to controls. FA values correlated to NIS but were unrelated to muscle strength. DTI of sciatic nerves seems promising to differentiate CIDP from controls. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate if the MRI technique diffusion tensor imaging can detect nerve lesions in Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) patients treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) Background: CIDP is diagnosed based on neurophysiological and clinical examination. Studies have shown that MRI of peripheral nerves can detect lesion in several types of polyneuropathy. Previously, it has been shown that Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is decreased in the tibial nerve from a mixed group of CIDP patients. Method(s): MRI of the sciatic and tibial nerves was performed at thigh and shin using the knee coil on a 3T Siemens Magnetom Skyra MR-scanner. At both thigh and shin one cross section was selected for imaging. Twenty slices were obtained (slice thickness/distance 4:2 mm) performing T2- and DTI-weighted MRI sequences with fat saturation. Data from DTI-weighted images served for pixel-by-pixel calculation of FA and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC). Circular region-of-interest (ROI) was segmented around the tibial and sciatic nerves at each image slice with reference to the T2-weighted images. Average FA- and ADC-values were calculated from the nerve ROI. Result(s): All CIDP patients (n=14) were treated with SCIG (Gammanorm). Healthy controls (n=14) were gender and age matched. FA-values of the tibial and the sciatic nerve were decreased in CIDP versus controls (0.34+/-0.07 vs 0.42+/-0.07 (P<0.0001) and 0.42+/-0.07 vs 0.48+/-0.03 (P<0.0001)). Correspondingly, ADC-values in tibial and sciatic nerve were increased in CIDP versus control (1833+/-277 vs 1648+/-175 (P<0.0001) and (1648+/-175 vs 1568+/-83 (P<0.05)). The sciatic/tibial ratio of the FA-map showed no difference comparing CIDP and controls (1.25+/-0.24 vs 1.16+/-0.15 (P=0.09)) but significant changes were found for the ADC-map (0.91+/-0.13 vs 0.98+/-0.10 (P=0.02)) Conclusion(s): We found decreased FA- and increased ADC-values on DTI of sciatic and tibial nerves in CIDP versus controls suggesting that in CIDP demyelination can be detected by MRI.

N2  - Objective: We studied whether distal peripheral nerves could be imaged using quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a 3-T MRI scanner, and visualized using tractography. Method(s): Altogether 6 healthy subjects were studied. The diffusion was quantified with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and the direction of main diffusivity was visualized with color-coded orientation maps and tractography. Result(s): We present the first DTI and tractography results of human distal peripheral nerves. The courses of median, ulnar, and radial nerves in the upper limb and of tibial and peroneal nerves in the lower limb were first analyzed quantifying ADC and FA, and then visualized in 3D with tractography. Tractography illustrated nicely the 3D courses of both upper and lower limb nerves which were reliably distinguished from the surrounding muscle tissue and ligaments. Conclusion(s): Quantitative DTI and tractography can be used to image and visualize distal peripheral nerves. Significance: DTI is a quantitative method that could provide useful information for the diagnosis and follow-up of nerve lesions, entrapments, and regeneration. Peripheral nerves as well-delineated structures also containing abundant branching into bundles of different diameters, could be used as 'living phantoms' for testing and validating different tractography methods. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of fiber tractography and diffusivity analysis generated from 3D diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences for preoperative assessment of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Method: MR imaging at 3 T was performed in 22 patients (mean age 41.9 ± 17.1y, 13 women) with histologically confirmed schwannomas (N = 18) and histologically confirmed neurofibromas (N = 11), including a 3D DW turbo spin echo sequence with fat suppression. Diffusion tensor parameters were computed and fiber tracks were determined. Evaluation was performed by two radiologists and one orthopedic surgeon blinded for final diagnosis. Mean diffusivity was computed to allow further assessment of tumor microstructure. Preoperative fascicle visualization was graded, fascicles were categorized regarding anatomical location and amount of fascicles surrounding the tumor. The agreement of imaging findings with intraoperative findings was assessed. Results: On 78.3 % of the DTI images, the fascicle visualization was rated as good or very good. Tractography differences were observed in schwannomas and neurofibromas, showing schwannomas to be significantly more often located eccentrically to the nerve (94.8 %) than neurofibromas (0 %, P &lt; 0.01). Fascicles were significantly more often continuous (87.5 %) in schwannomas, while in neurofibromas, none of the tracks was graded to be continuous (0 %, P = 0.014). A substantial agreement between fiber tracking and surgical anatomy was found regarding the fascicle courses surrounding the tumor (κ = 0.78). Mean diffusivity of schwannomas (1.5 ± 0.2 × 10−3 mm2/s) was significantly lower than in neurofibromas (1.8 ± 0.2 × 10−3 mm2/s; P &lt; 0.001). The Youden index showed an optimal cutoff at 1.7 × 10−3 mm2/s (sensitivity, 0.91; specificity, 0.78; J = 0.69). Conclusions: Preoperative diffusion tensor imaging allowed to accurately differentiate between schwannomas and neurofibromas and to describe their location in relation to the nerve fascicles for preoperative planning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Lower back pain is a common problem frequently encountered without specific biomarkers that correlate well with an individual patient's pain generators. MRI quantification of diffusion and T2 relaxation properties may provide novel insight into the mechanical and inflammatory changes that occur in the lumbosacral nerve roots in patients with lower back pain. Accurate imaging of the spinal nerve roots is difficult because of their small caliber and oblique course in all three planes. Two-dimensional in-plane imaging of the lumbosacral nerve roots requires oblique coronal imaging with large field of view (FOV) in both dimensions, resulting in severe geometric distortions using single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) techniques. The present work describes initial success using a reduced-FOV single-shot spin-echo EPI acquisition to obtain in-plane diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2 mapping of the bilateral lumbar nerve roots at the L4 level of healthy subjects, minimizing partial volume effects, breathing artifacts and geometric distortions. A significant variation in DTI and T2 mapping metrics is also reported along the course of the normal nerve root. The fractional anisotropy is statistically significantly lower in the dorsal root ganglia (0.287±0.068) than in more distal regions in the spinal nerve (0.402±0.040) (p&lt;10-5). The T2 relaxation value is statistically significantly higher in the dorsal root ganglia (78.0±11.9ms) than in more distal regions in the spinal nerve (59.5±7.4ms) (p&lt;10-5). The quantification of nerve root DTI and T2 properties using the proposed methodology may identify the specific site of any degenerative and inflammatory changes along the nerve roots of patients with lower back pain. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Background: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a common inherited axonal or mixed axonal-demyelinating neuropathy. The disease is caused by mutations in the GJB1 gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin32, which is expressed in both Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Several reports have described CMTX patients presenting with transient and recurrent central nervous system (CNS) symptoms with transient white matter lesions in the brain. Patients: We describe a man with CMTX who presented with transient CNS symptoms and abnormal cerebral white matter lesions in MRI. He was subjected to a detailed MRI examination using two specialized techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Results: In the early stage of his CNS symptoms, MRS studies revealed reduced N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) levels in deep white matter, and DTI revealed reduced fractional anisotropy within lesions. Interestingly, these reductions began to recover from day 19 after admission, and follow-up DTI and MRS studies on day 101 revealed a reversal of the abnormalities. Conclusion: The findings of reversible reductions in fractional anisotropy and NAA levels in our patient suggest reversible axonal damage associated with deficient oligodendrocyte gap junctions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine whether quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) adds diagnostic accuracy in magnetic resonance neurography. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board. We enrolled 16 patients with peripheral polyneuropathy of various etiologies involving the upper arm and 30 healthy controls. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3 T using transverse T2-weighted (T2-w) turbo spin echo and spin echo planar imaging diffusion-weighted sequences. T2-weighted normalized signal (nT2), fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) of the median, ulnar, and radial nerves were quantified after manual segmentation. Diagnostic performance of each separate parameter and combinations of parameters was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Bootstrap validation was used to adjust for potential overfitting. RESULTS Average nT2, ADC, RD, and AD values of the median, ulnar, and radial nerve were significantly increased in neuropathy patients compared with that in healthy controls (nT2, 1.49 ± 0.05 vs 1.05 ± 0.05; ADC, 1.4 × 10(-3) ± 2.8 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 1.1 × 10(-3) ± 1.3 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s; RD, 9.5 × 10(-4) ± 2.9 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 7.2 × 10(-4) ± 1.3 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s; AD, 2.3 × 10(-3) ± 3.7 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s vs 2.0 × 10(-3) ± 2.2 × 10(-5) mm(2)/s; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Fractional anisotropy values were significantly decreased in patients (0.51 ± 0.01 vs 0.59 ± 0.01; P < 0.001). T2-weighted normalized signal and DTI parameters had comparable diagnostic accuracy (adjusted AUC: T2-w, 0.92; FA, 0.88; ADC, 0.89; AD, 0.84; RD, 0.86). Combining DTI parameters significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy over single-parameter analysis. In addition, the combination of nT2 with DTI parameters yielded excellent adjusted AUCs up to 0.97 (nT2 + FA). CONCLUSIONS Diffusion tensor imaging has high diagnostic accuracy in peripheral neuropathy. Combining DTI with T2 can outperform T2-w imaging alone and provides added value in magnetic resonance neurography.

N2  - Development of outcome measures to assess ongoing nerve regeneration in the living animal that can be translated to man can provide extremely useful tools for monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions to speed nerve regeneration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive technique that can be applied serially on the same subject to monitor pathophysiologic changes in different tissues. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an MR imaging technique, is based on the movements of water molecules within biological tissues. In neural tissues water molecules tend to move along the nerve fibers and tracts. This motion of water molecules in a preferential orientation is called 'anisotropic diffusion' and DTI can create a new image contrast that shows locations of tissues with high anisotropy, namely nerve tracts. In this proof of concept studies, we examined the use of ex vivo high-resolution DTI for imaging intact and regenerating peripheral nerves in mice and validated the MRI findings with histological studies. DTI was done on sciatic nerves with and without crush at two different time points and in four different mouse strains. DTI measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA), parallel diffusivity, and perpendicular diffusivity were acquired and compared in proximal and distal segments of uninjured and crushed nerves and correlated with morphometry. A comparison of axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush showed a comparable pattern of regeneration in the four different mice strains. In crushed sciatic nerves the average parallel diffusivity was significantly lower compared to uninjured sciatic nerve segments, indicating a decreased parallel motion of water molecules along the axons. Validation studies indicate that the FA values showed highest correlation with the total number of regenerating axons and the perpendicular diffusivity was negatively correlated with axon counts. These studies indicate that DTI is a sensitive measure of axon regeneration in mouse models and establish the foundations for further development of imaging technology for application to living animals and humans.

N2  - DTI is a magnetic resonance based technology that is particularly suited for imaging nerve fiber tracts. Because of limitations of current clinical and investigative measures to assess peripheral nerve injury and repair in some clinical situations, the need for non-invasive imaging of peripheral nerves that can reliably assess extent of nerve degeneration and regeneration is increasingly realized.Availability of such a technology can be immediately applicable to patients with traumatic nerve injuries to assess nerve injury and repair and in the area of therapeutics aiming to enhance nerve regeneration/ repair. With this in mind, we have developed acquisition and image analysis protocols to obtain quantitative measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA), parallel and perpendicular diffusivities, and FA-based 3D-reconstructions of the individual nerves. Eight normal controls underwent scanning of their lower legs or forearms with the goal to develop norms for different DTI parameters for further application to patients to differentiate the healthy and diseased nerves and monitor nerve regeneration/repair. Our results show the viability of this approach to image various nerves of different sizes in both upper and lower extremities. These ongoing studies support that this imaging modality has the potential to assess nerve injury and repair.

N2  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and potential clinical applications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography in the normal and pathologic brachial plexus prospectively. Methods: Six asymptomatic volunteers and 12 patients with symptoms related to the brachial plexus underwent DTI on a 1.5T system in addition to the routine anatomic plexus imaging protocol. Maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and of fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as tractography of the brachial plexus were obtained. Images were evaluated by two experienced neuroradiologists in a prospective fashion. Three patients underwent surgery, and nine patients underwent conservative medical treatment. Results: Reconstructed DTI (17/18) were of good quality (one case could not be reconstructed due to artifacts). In all volunteers and in 11 patients, the roots and the trunks were clearly delineated with tractography. Mean FA and mean ADC values were as follows: 0.30±0.079 and 1.70±0.35 mm2/s in normal fibers, 0.22±0.04 and 1.49±0.49 mm2/s in benign neurogenic tumors, and 0.24±0.08 and 1.51±0.52 mm 2/s in malignant tumors, respectively. Although there was no statistically significant difference in FA and ADC values of normal fibers and fibers at the level of pathology, tractography revealed major differences regarding fiber architecture. In benign neurogenic tumors (n=4), tractography revealed fiber displacement alone (n=2) or fiber displacement and encasement by the tumor (n=2), whereas in the malignant tumors, either fiber disruption/destruction with complete disorganization (n=6) or fiber displacement (n=1) were seen. In patients with fiber displacement alone, surgery confirmed the tractography findings, and excision was successful without sequelae. Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that DTI with tractography is feasible in a clinical routine setting. DTI may demonstrate normal tracts, tract displacement, deformation, infiltration, disruption, and disorganization of fibers due to tumors located within or along the brachial plexus, therefore, yielding additional information to the current standard anatomic imaging protocols. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking is used for 3-dimensional visualization of the nervous system. Peripheral nerves and all cranial nerves, except for the olfactory tract, have previously been visualized. The olfactory tracts are difficult to depict with diffusion-weighted imaging due to the high sensitivity to susceptibility artifacts at the base of the skull. Here we report an optimized single-shot diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence that can visualize the olfactory tracts with fiber tracking. Five healthy individuals were examined, and the olfactory tracts could be fiber tracked with the diffusion-weighted sequence. For comparison and as a negative control, an anosmic patient was examined. No olfactory tracts were visualized on T2-weighted nor diffusion-weighted fiber tracking images. Measuring diffusion in the olfactory tracts promise to facilitate the identification of different hyposmic and anosmic conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method for efficient nerve pathways visualization. DTI, particularly of peripheral nerves, is commonly performed in 3 T scanners. An often more accessible 1.5 T scanners are less likely to be chosen for DTI examinations due to generally lower image quality. Novel radiofrequency (RF) coils can help improve the signal to noise ratio in MRI and thus improve image quality. This study preliminary results of the feasibility and outcomes assessment of DTI-based tractography of the forearm nerves employing a novel coil design in 1.5 T scanners. The proposed scanning protocol includes the use of a metamaterial-inspired RF coil, a common DTI pulse sequence and a 3D T1-weighted morphological reference pulse sequence. The protocol is tested on three healthy volunteers. Two tract bundles corresponding to median and ulnar nerves of the forearm are reliably reconstructed in all subjects. The results show that with an appropriate choice of RF coil and pulse sequence parameters forearm DTI studies can be performed in 1.5 T scanners with sufficient quality making such examination more accessible for clinical use. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and related techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are uniquely sensitive to the microstructure of the brain and spinal cord. In the acute aftermath of nervous system injury, for example, DWI reveals changes caused by injury that remains invisible on other MRI contrasts such as T2-weighted imaging. This ability has led to a demonstrated clinical utility in cerebral ischemia. However, despite strong promise in preclinical models and research settings, DWI has not been as readily adopted for other acute injuries such as traumatic spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the precise biophysical mechanisms that underlie DWI and DTI changes are not fully understood. In this report, we review the DWI and DTI changes that occur in acute neurological injury of cerebral ischemia, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and peripheral nerve injury. Their associations with the underlying biology are examined with an emphasis on the role of acute axon and dendrite beading. Lastly, emerging DWI techniques to overcome the limitations of DTI are discussed as these may offer the needed improvements to translate to clinical settings.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Nerve regeneration after an injury should occur in a timely fashion for function to be restored. Current methods cannot monitor regeneration prior to muscle reinnervation. Diffusion tensor imaging has been previously shown to provide quantitative indices after nerve recovery. The goal of this study was to validate the use of this technology following nerve injury via a series of rat sciatic nerve injury/repair studies. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were prospectively divided by procedure (sham, crush, or cut/repair) and time points (1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after surgery). At the appropriate time point, each animal was euthanized and the sciatic nerve was harvested and fixed. Data were obtained using a 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system. For validation, findings were compared to behavioral testing (foot fault asymmetry and sciatic function index) and cross-sectional axonal counting of toluidine blue-stained sections examined under light microscopy. Results: Sixty-three rats were divided into three treatment groups (sham, n = 21; crush, n = 23; and cut/repair, n = 19). Fractional anisotropy was able to differentiate between recovery following sham, crush, and cut/repair injuries as early as 2 weeks (p < 0.05), with more accurate differentiation thereafter. More importantly, the difference in anisotropy between distal and proximal regions recognized animals with successful and failed recoveries according to behavioral analysis, especially at 12 weeks. In addition, diffusion tension imaging-based tractography provided a visual representation of nerve continuity in all treatment groups. Conclusions: Diffuse tensor imaging is an objective and noninvasive tool for monitoring nerve regeneration. Its use could facilitate earlier detection of failed repairs to potentially help improve outcomes. Copyright © 2020 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

N2  - Purpose: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is caused by drug-induced damage to the axons which is not detected easily due to lack of reliable, clinically applicable modalities. Diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) allows for quantitative measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which have been shown to detect nerve injury by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Methods: We sought to evaluate if DTI could be used for detection of CIPN in patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane. Patients with h/o exposure to neurotoxic chemotherapy, diabetes, or peripheral neuropathy were excluded. Patients completed pre- and post-chemotherapy MRI of bilateral legs and FACT&GOG-Ntx. Genotyping of single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) was performed to detect known associations with CIPN. Results: We had 14 evaluable patients in this prospective trial. Mean FA values post-chemotherapy were significantly lower than baseline at mid-calf (p < 0.0001) and ankle (p = 0.03). We did not find any significant change in mean ADC values. In patients without symptomatic neuropathy, mean FA values decreased more than symptomatic patients at mid-calf (p < 0.001). Of the 41 genotyped SNVs, only rs8110536 was found to be significantly associated with development of CIPN. Conclusions: Our results show that FA values are indicative of CIPN and differential changes in FA values in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients highlights its potential to be further studied as a predictive biomarker for CIPN. This is the first study to highlight a non-invasive, imaging based, objective biomarker which, if validated, can be translated into clinic easily. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background. We sought to determine the value of diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for characterization of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Methods. Twenty-six patients with NF1 and suspicion of malignant transformation of PNSTs were prospectively enrolled and underwent DW MRI at 3T. For a set of benign (n = 55) and malignant (n = 12) PNSTs, functional MRI parameters were derived from both biexponential intravoxel incoherent motion (diffusion coefficient D and perfusion fraction f) and monoexponential data analysis (apparent diffusion coefficients [ADCs]). A panel of morphological MRI features was evaluated using T1- and T2-weighted imaging. Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher's exact test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative and qualitative MRI. Cohen's kappa was used to determine interrater reliability. Results. Malignant PNSTs demonstrated significantly lower diffusivity (P < 0.0001) compared with benign PNSTs. The perfusion fraction f was significantly higher in malignant PNSTs (P < 0.001). In ROC analysis, functional MRI parameters showed high diagnostic accuracy for differentiation of PNSTs (eg, ADCmean, 92% sensitivity with 98% specificity, AUC 0.98; Dmean, 92% sensitivity with 98% specificity, AUC 0.98). By contrast, morphological imaging features had only limited sensitivity (18-94%) and specificity (18-82%) for identification of malignancy. Interrater reliability was higher for monoexponential data analysis. Conclusion. DW imaging shows better diagnostic performance than morphological features and allows accurate differentiation of benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in NF1. © 2019 Society for Neuro-Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

N2  - We report on a patient with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) who was diagnosed with conversion disorder for severe weakness of an arm, which was demonstrated using diffiusion tensor tractography (DTT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A 23-year-old right-handed female suffered from head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident. She underwent rehabilitative management for memory impairment and central pain. At 14 months after onset, she complained of severe weakness of her right arm, which was detected in the morning after sleeping (right shoulder abductor: 3/5, elbow flexor: 3/5, wrist extensor: 1/5, finger flexor: 1/5, and finger extensor: 1/5). Electromyography study for peripheral neuropathy performed at 2 weeks after onset of weakness showed no abnormality. On a 14-month DTT configuration, the integrities of the left corticospinal tract (CST), supplementary motor area-corticofugal tract (SMA-CFT), and dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC)-CFT were well-preserved. Significant differences were not observed for the fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffiusivity (MD), and tract volume (TV) values of the CST, SMA-CFT, and dPMC-CFT in both hemispheres between the patient and ten right-handed age- and sex-matched normal subjects (p > 0.05). On a 14-month TMS study, MEPs obtained at the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle showed no abnormality. Using DTT and TMS, conversion disorder was demonstrated in a patient with mild TBI, who showed severe weakness of an arm. Our results suggest the usefulness of an evaluation of the CST and CFTs from the secondary motor areas using DTT, and the CST using TMS for patients who complain of motor weakness due to conversion disorder. © 2019 by the authors.

N2  - 1. Foot infections in patients with diabetes cause substantial morbidity and frequent visits to health care professionals and may lead to amputation of a lower extremity. 2. Diabetic foot infections require attention to local (foot) and systemic (metabolic) issues and coordinated management, preferably by a multidisciplinary foot-care team (A-II) (). The team managing these infections should include, or have ready access to, an infectious diseases specialist or a medical microbiologist (B-II). 3. The major predisposing factor to these infections is foot ulceration, which is usually related to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral vascular disease and various immunological disturbances play a secondary role. 4. Aerobic Gram-positive cocci (especially Staphylococcus aureus) are the predominant pathogens in diabetic foot infections. Patients who have chronic wounds or who have recently received antibiotic therapy may also be infected with Gram-negative rods, and those with foot ischemia or gangrene may have obligate anaerobic pathogens. 5. Wound infections must be diagnosed clinically on the basis of local (and occasionally systemic) signs and symptoms of inflammation. Laboratory (including microbiological) investigations are of limited use for diagnosing infection, except in cases of osteomyelitis (B-II). 6. Send appropriately obtained specimens for culture before starting empirical antibiotic therapy in all cases of infection, except perhaps those that are mild and previously untreated (B-III). Tissue specimens obtained by biopsy, ulcer curettage, or aspiration are preferable to wound swab specimens (A-I). 7. Imaging studies may help diagnose or better define deep, soft-tissue purulent collections and are usually needed to detect pathological findings in bone. Plain radiography may be adequate in many cases, but MRI (in preference to isotope scanning) is more sensitive and specific, especially for detection of soft-tissue lesions (A-I). 8. Infections should be categorized by their severity on the basis of readily assessable clinical and laboratory features (B-II). Most important among these are the specific tissues involved, the adequacy of arterial perfusion, and the presence of systemic toxicity or metabolic instability. Categorization helps determine the degree of risk to the patient and the limb and, thus, the urgency and venue of management. 9. Available evidence does not support treating clinically uninfected ulcers with antibiotic therapy (D-III). Antibiotic therapy is necessary for virtually all infected wounds, but it is often insufficient without appropriate wound care. 10. Select an empirical antibiotic regimen on the basis of the severity of the infection and the likely etiologic agent(s) (B-II). Therapy aimed solely at aerobic Gram-positive cocci may be sufficient for mild-to-moderate infections in patients who have not recently received antibiotic therapy (A-II). Broad-spectrum empirical therapy is not routinely required but is indicated for severe infections, pending culture results and antibiotic susceptibility data (B-III). Take into consideration any recent antibiotic therapy and local antibiotic susceptibility data, especially the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms. Definitive therapy should be based on both the culture results and susceptibility data and the clinical response to the empirical regimen (C-III). 11. There is only limited evidence with which to make informed choices among the various topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotic agents. Virtually all severe and some moderate infections require parenteral therapy, at least initially (C-III). Highly bioavailable oral antibiotics can be used in most mild and in many moderate infections, including some cases of osteomyelitis (A-II). Topical therapy may be used for some mild superficial infections (B-I). 12. Continue antibiotic therapy until there is evidence that the infection has resolved but not necessarily until a wound has healed. Suggestions for the duration of antibiotic therapy are as follows: for mild infections, 12 weeks usually suffices, but some require an additional 12 weeks; for moderate and severe infections, usually 24 weeks is sufficient, depending on the structures involved, the adequacy of debridement, the type of soft-tissue wound cover, and wound vascularity (A-II); and for osteomyelitis, generally at least 46 weeks is required, but a shorter duration is sufficient if the entire infected bone is removed, and probably a longer duration is needed if infected bone remains (B-II). 13. If an infection in a clinically stable patient fails to respond to 1 antibiotic courses, consider discontinuing all antimicrobials and, after a few days, obtaining optimal culture specimens (C-III). 14. Seek surgical consultation and, when needed, intervention for infections accompanied by a deep abscess, extensive bone or joint involvement, crepitus, substantial necrosis or gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis (A-II). Evaluating the limb's arterial supply and revascularizing when indicated are particularly important. Surgeons with experience and interest in the field should be recruited by the foot-care team, if possible. 15. Providing optimal wound care, in addition to appropriate antibiotic treatment of the infection, is crucial for healing (A-I). This includes proper wound cleansing, debridement of any callus and necrotic tissue, and, especially, off-loading of pressure. There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific wound dressing or any type of wound healing agents or products for infected foot wounds. 16. Patients with infected wounds require early and careful follow-up observation to ensure that the selected medical and surgical treatment regimens have been appropriate and effective (B-III). 17. Studies have not adequately defined the role of most adjunctive therapies for diabetic foot infections, but systematic reviews suggest that granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and systemic hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help prevent amputations (B-I). These treatments may be useful for severe infections or for those that have not adequately responded to therapy, despite correcting for all amenable local and systemic adverse factors. 18. Spread of infection to bone (osteitis or osteomyelitis) may be difficult to distinguish from noninfectious osteoarthropathy. Clinical examination and imaging tests may suffice, but bone biopsy is valuable for establishing the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, for defining the pathogenic organism(s), and for determining the antibiotic susceptibilities of such organisms (B-II). 19. Although this field has matured, further research is much needed. The committee especially recommends that adequately powered prospective studies be undertaken to elucidate and validate systems for classifying infection, diagnosing osteomyelitis, defining optimal antibiotic regimens in various situations, and clarifying the role of surgery in treating osteomyelitis (A-III).

N2  - Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe and yet most poorly understood complications of diabetes mellitus. In vivo imaging of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a key structure for the understanding of DPN, has been restricted to animal studies. These have shown a correlation of decreased DRG volume with neuropathic symptom severity. Our objective was to investigate correlations of DRG morphology and signal characteristics at 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) with clinical and serological data in diabetic patients with and without DPN. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent 3T MRN of both L5 DRG using an isotropic 3D T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence with subsequent segmentation of DRG volume and analysis of normalized signal properties. Overall, 55 diabetes patients (66 ± 9 years; 32 men; 30 with DPN) took part in this study. DRG volume was smaller in patients with severe DPN when compared to patients with mild or moderate DPN (134.7 ± 21.86 vs 170.1 ± 49.22; p = 0.040). In DPN patients, DRG volume was negatively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r = −0.43; 95%CI = −0.66 to −0.14; p = 0.02), a measure of neuropathy severity. DRG volume showed negative correlations with triglycerides (r = −0.40; 95%CI = −0.57 to −0.19; p = 0.006), and LDL cholesterol (r = −0.33; 95%CI = −0.51 to −0.11; p = 0.04). There was a strong positive correlation of normalized MR signal intensity (SI) with the neuropathy symptom score in the subgroup of patients with painful DPN (r = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.46 to 0.93; p = 0.005). DRG SI was positively correlated with HbA1c levels (r = 0.30; 95%CI = 0.09 to 0.50; p = 0.03) and the triglyceride/HDL ratio (r = 0.40; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.57; p = 0.007). In this first in vivo study, we found DRG morphological degeneration and signal increase in correlation with neuropathy severity. This elucidates the potential importance of MR-based DRG assessments in studying structural and functional changes in DPN. © Copyright © 2020 Jende, Kender, Rother, Alvarez-Ramos, Groener, Pham, Morgenstern, Oikonomou, Hahn, Juerchott, Kollmer, Heiland, Kopf, Nawroth, Bendszus and Kurz.

N2  - Background: Small peripheral nerve tractography is challenging because of the trade-off among resolution, image acquisition time, and signal-to-noise ratio. Purpose: To optimize pixel size and slice thickness parameters for fiber tractography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material and Methods: Fifteen healthy volunteers (mean age 30 ± 6.8 years) were recruited prospectively. Axial T2-weighted and DTI scans were acquired, covering the cubital tunnel, using different pixel sizes and slice thicknesses. Three-dimensional (3D) nerve tractography was evaluated for the median number and length of the reconstructed fiber tracts and visual score from 0 to 5. Two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional DTI was evaluated for fractional anisotropy (FA) values throughout the length of the ulnar nerve. Results: A pixel size of 1.3 mm2 revealed the highest number of reconstructed nerve fibers compared to that of 1.1 mm2 (P = 0.048), with a good visual score. A slice thickness of 4 mm had the highest number of reconstructed nerve fibers and visual score compared with other thicknesses (all P &lt; 0.05). In 2D cross-sectional images, the median FA values were in the range of 0.40–0.63 at the proximal, central, and distal portions of the cubital tunnel. Inter-observer agreement for all parameters was good to excellent. Conclusion: For fiber tractography and DTI of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel, optimal image quality was obtained using a 1.3-mm2 pixel size and 4-mm slice thickness under MR parameters of this study at 3T. © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2020.

N2  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established tool in probing cortical plasticity in vivo. Changes in corticomotor excitability can be induced using paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, in which TMS over the primary motor cortex is conditioned with an electrical peripheral nerve stimulation of the contralateral hand. PAS with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms induces long-term potentiation (LTP)like effects in cortical excitability. However, the response to a PAS protocol tends to vary substantially across individuals. In this study, we used univariate and multivariate data-driven methods to investigate various previously proposed determinants of inter-individual variability in PAS efficacy, such as demographic, cognitive, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging measures. Forty-one right-handed participants, comprising 22 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 19 healthy controls (HC), underwent the PAS protocol. Prior to stimulation, demographic, genetic, clinical, as well as structural and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The two groups did not differ in any of the variables, except by global cognitive status. Univariate analysis showed that only 61% of all participants were classified as PAS responders, irrespective of group membership. Higher PAS response was associated with lower TMS intensity and with higher resting-state connectivity within the sensorimotor network, but only in responders, as opposed to non-responders. We also found an overall positive correlation between PAS response and structural connectivity within the corticospinal tract, which did not differ between groups. A multivariate random forest (RF) model identified age, gender, education, IQ, global cognitive status, sleep quality, alertness, TMS intensity, genetic factors, and neuroimaging measures (functional and structural connectivity, gray matter (GM) volume, and cortical thickness as poor predictors of PAS response. The model resulted in low accuracy of the RF classifier (58%; 95% CI: 42 − 74%), with a higher relative importance of brain connectivity measures compared to the other variables. We conclude that PAS variability in our sample was not well explained by factors known to influence PAS efficacy, emphasizing the need for future replication studies.

N2  - Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been shown to provide valuable structural information in biological fibrous soft tissues, such as the central and peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscle, based on the acquisition of a series of images that sample q-space. Existing q-space sampling schemes have been compared using several metrics based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which models the restricted diffusion inside fibres as anisotropic unrestricted diffusion. Otherwise, sampling schemes have been optimized using model-independent cost functions. We propose using a model-based framework that connects the experimental noise, the uncertainty in the estimation of the model parameters, and the q-space sampling schemes together, to obtain model-based optimal sampling schemes for the case when the fibre orientation is known a priori to be within a finite region. We apply and validate this framework for the recently proposed quantitative analysis of q-space MRI data (QUAQ) model. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Quantitative diffusion MRI is a promising technique for evaluating peripheral nerve integrity but low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede measurement accuracy. Purpose: To evaluate principal component analysis (PCA) and generalized spherical deconvolution (genSD) denoising techniques to improve within-subject reproducibility and peripheral nerve conspicuity. Study Type: Prospective. Subjects: Seven healthy volunteers and three peripheral neuropathy patients. Field Strength/Sequence: 3T/multiband single-shot echo planar diffusion sequence using multishell 55-direction scheme. Assessment: Images were processed using four methods: "original" (no denoising), "average" (10 repetitions), "PCA-only," and "PCA + genSD." Tibial and common peroneal nerve segmentations and masks were generated from volunteer diffusion data. Quantitative (SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) values were calculated. Three radiologists qualitatively evaluated nerve conspicuity for each method. The two denoising methods were also performed in three patients with peripheral neuropathies. Statistical Tests: For healthy volunteers, calculations included SNR and CNRFA (computed using FA values). Coefficient of variation (CV%) of CNRFA quantified within-subject reproducibility. Groups were compared with two-sample t-tests (significance P &lt; 0.05; two-tailed, Bonferroni-corrected). Odds ratios (ORs) quantified the relative rates of each of three radiologists confidently identifying a nerve, per slice, for the four methods. Results: "PCA + genSD" yielded the highest SNR (meanoverall = 14.83 ± 1.99) and tibial and common peroneal nerve CNRFA (meantibial = 3.45, meanperoneal = 2.34) compared to "original" (PSNR &lt; 0.001; PCNR = 0.011) and "PCA-only" (PSNR &lt; 0.001, PCNR &lt; 0.001). "PCA + genSD" had higher within-subject reproducibility (low CV%) for tibial (6.04 ± 1.98) and common peroneal nerves (8.27 ± 2.75) compared to "original" and "PCA-only." The mean FA was higher for "original" than "average" (P &lt; 0.001), but did not differ significantly between "average" and "PCA + genSD" (P = 0.14). "PCA + genSD" had higher tibial and common peroneal nerve conspicuity than "PCA-only" (ORtibial = 2.50, P &lt; 0.001; ORperoneal = 1.86, P &lt; 0.001) and "original" (ORtibial = 2.73, P &lt; 0.001; ORperoneal = 2.43, P &lt; 0.001). Data Conclusion: PCA + genSD denoising method improved SNR, CNRFA, and within-subject reproducibility (CV%) without biasing FA and nerve conspicuity. This technique holds promise for facilitating more reliable, unbiased diffusion measurements of peripheral nerves. Level of Evidence: 2. Technical Efficacy Stage: 1. J. Magn. Reson.

N2  - Objectives: This study reports on a patient who developed degeneration of an injured spinothalamic tract (STT) detected on diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Case description: A 56-year-old female had suffered from head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident. The patient did not experience loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia and the patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. She had begun to feel pain in her left hand and foot at ~ 7 days after onset. The characteristics and severity of pain were as follows: constant tingling and pricking sensation without allodynia or hyperalgesia (Visual Analogue Scale score: 3~4). No specific focal lesion was observed on brain and spine MRI and an electromyography study showed no evidence of peripheral nerve injury or radiculopathy. At 6 months after onset, the central pain in the left hand and foot became aggravated, with a Visual Analogue Scale score of 6. Results: On 1-month DTT, partial tearing was observed in both STTs. In contrast, both partially torn STTs had become atrophy on 9-month DTT. Conclusions: This study recommends further studies conducted on the prognosis (regeneration or degeneration) of injured STTs and on the effect of change of an injured STT on central pain. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Growing evidence indicates that alterations within the peripheral
nervous system (PNS) are involved at an early stage in the amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenetic cascade. In this study, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), neurophysiologic analyses, and histologic
analyses were used to monitor the extent of PNS damage in the
hSOD-1(G93A) ALS rat model. The imaging signature of the disease was
defined using in vivo MRI of the sciatic nerve. Initial abnormalities
were detected in the nerves by an increase in T2 relaxation time before
the onset of clinical disease; diffusion MRI showed a progressive
increase in mean and radial diffusivity and reduction of fractional
anisotropy at advanced stages of disease. Histologic analysis
demonstrated early impairment of the blood-nerve barrier followed by
acute axonal degeneration associated with endoneurial edema and
macrophage response in motor nerve compartments. Progressive axonal
degeneration and motor nerve fiber loss correlated with MRI and
neurophysiologic changes. These functional and morphologic
investigations of the PNS might be applied in following disease
progression in preclinical therapeutic studies. This study establishes
the PNS signature in this rat ALS model (shedding new light into
pathogenesis) and provides a rationale for translating into future
systematic MRI studies of PNS involvement in patients with ALS.

N2  - CONTEXT: Although diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is predominantly considered a  disorder of the peripheral nerves, some evidence for central nervous system involvement has recently emerged. However, whether or to what extent the microstructure of central somatosensory tracts may be injured remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To detect the microstructure of central somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients and to correlate it with the severity of DPN. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-seven subjects with type 2 diabetes (25 with DPN, 32 without DPN) and thirty-three nondiabetic controls. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of two major somatosensory tracts (the spinothalamic tract and its thalamocortical [spino-thalamo-cortical, STC] pathway, the medial lemniscus and its thalamocortical [medial lemnisco-thalamo-cortical, MLTC] pathway) were assessed based on diffusion tensor tractography. Regression models were further applied to detect the association of FA values with the severity of DPN in diabetic patients. RESULTS: The mean FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly lower in patients with DPN than those without DPN and controls. Moreover, FA values of left STC and left MLTC pathways were significantly associated with the severity of DPN (expressed as Toronto Clinical Scoring System values) in patients after adjusting for multiple confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated the axonal degeneration of central somatosensory tracts in type 2 diabetic patients with DPN. The parallel disease progression of the intra- and extracranial somatosensory system merits further attention to the central nerves in diabetic patients with DPN.

N2  - Following upper limb peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair, some patients regain good sensorimotor function while others do not. Understanding peripheral and central mechanisms that contribute to recovery may facilitate the development of new therapeutic interventions. Plasticity following peripheral nerve transection has been demonstrated throughout the neuroaxis in animal models of nerve injury. However, the brain changes that occur following peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair in humans have not been examined. Furthermore, the extent to which peripheral nerve regeneration influences functional and structural brain changes has not been characterized. Therefore, we asked whether functional changes are accompanied by grey and/or white matter structural changes and whether these changes relate to sensory recovery? To address these key issues we (i) assessed peripheral nerve regeneration; (ii) measured functional magnetic resonance imaging brain activation (blood oxygen level dependent signal; BOLD) in response to a vibrotactile stimulus; (iii) examined grey and white matter structural brain plasticity; and (iv) correlated sensory recovery measures with grey matter changes in peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair patients. Compared to each patient's healthy contralesional nerve, transected nerves have impaired nerve conduction 1.5 years after transection and repair, conducting with decreased amplitude and increased latency. Compared to healthy controls, peripheral nerve transection and surgical repair patients had altered blood oxygen level dependent signal activity in the contralesional primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, and in a set of brain areas known as the 'task positive network'. In addition, grey matter reductions were identified in several brain areas, including the contralesional primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, in the same areas where blood oxygen level dependent signal reductions were identified. Furthermore, grey matter thinning in the post-central gyrus was negatively correlated with measures of sensory recovery (mechanical and vibration detection) demonstrating a clear link between function and structure. Finally, we identified reduced white matter fractional anisotropy in the right insula in a region that also demonstrated reduced grey matter. These results provide insight into brain plasticity and structure-function-behavioural relationships following nerve injury and have important therapeutic implications.

N2  - Objective. The use of a biofabrication nerve scaffold, which mimics the nerve microstructure, as an alternative for autologous nerve transplantation is a promising strategy for treating peripheral nerve defects. This study aimed to design a customized biofabrication scaffold model with the characteristics of human peripheral nerve fascicles. Methods. We used Micro-MRI technique to obtain different nerve fascicles. A full-length 28 cm tibial nerve specimen was obtained and was divided into 14 two-centimetre nerve segments. 3D models of the nerve fascicles were obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction after image segmentation. The central line of the nerve fascicles was fitted, and the aggregation of nerve fascicles was analysed quantitatively. The nerve scaffold was designed by simulating the clinical nerve defect and extracting information from the acquired nerve fascicle data; the scaffold design was displayed by 3D printing to verify the accuracy of the model. Result. The microstructure of the sciatic nerve, tibial nerve, and common peroneal nerve in the nerve fascicles could be obtained by three-dimensional reconstruction. The number of cross fusions of tibial nerve fascicles from proximal end to distal end decreased gradually. By designing the nerve graft in accordance with the microstructure of the nerve fascicles, the 3D printed model demonstrated that the two ends of the nerve defect can be well matched. Conclusion. The microstructure of the nerve fascicles is complicated and changeable, and the spatial position of each nerve fascicle and the long segment of the nerve fascicle aggregation show great changes at different levels. Under the premise of the stability of the existing imaging techniques, a large number of scanning nerve samples can be used to set up a three-dimensional database of the peripheral nerve fascicle microstructure, integrating the gross imaging information, and provide a template for the design of the downstream nerve graft model. © 2019 Zhi Yao et al.

N2  - The stress system provides integration of both neurochemical and somatic physiologic functions within organisms as an adaptive mechanism to changing environmental conditions throughout evolution. In mammals and primates the complexity and sophistication of these systems have surpassed other species in triaging neurochemical and physiologic signaling to maximize chances of survival. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and its related peptides and receptors have been identified over the last three decades and are fundamental molecular initiators of the stress response. They are crucial in the top down regulatory cascade over a myriad of neurochemical, neuroendocrine and sympathetic nervous system events. From neuroscience, we've seen that stress activation impacts behavior, endocrine and somatic physiology and influences neurochemical events that one can capture in real time with current imaging technologies. To delineate these effects one can demonstrate how the CRH neuronal networks infiltrate critical cognitive, emotive and autonomic regions of the central nervous system (CNS) with somatic effects. Abundant preclinical and clinical studies show inter-regulatory actions of CRH with multiple neurotransmitters/peptides. Stress, both acute and chronic has epigenetic effects which magnify genetic susceptibilities to alter neurochemistry; stress system activation can add critical variables in design and interpretation of basic and clinical neuroscience and related research. This review will attempt to provide an overview of the spectrum of known functions and speculative actions of CRH and stress responses in light of imaging technology and its interpretation. Metabolic and neuroreceptor positron emission/single photon tomography (PET/SPECT), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), anatomic MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (pMRS) are technologies that can delineate basic mechanisms of neurophysiology and pharmacology. Stress modulates the myriad of neurochemical and networks within and controlled through the central and peripheral nervous system and the effects of stress activation on imaging will be highlighted. © 2014.

N2  - Background: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are widely used in the evaluation of the central nervous system and recently have been reported as a potential tool for diagnosis of the peripheral nerve or the lumbar nerve entrapment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate consecutive changes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of normal lumbar nerve roots from the junction of the dura mater. Methods: The lumbar spinal nerves were examined in 6 male healthy volunteers (mean age, 35 years) with no experiences of sciatica, with a 3.0-T MR unit using a five-element phased-array surface coil. DTI was performed with the following imaging parameters: 11084.6/73.7 ms for TR/TE; b-value, 800 s/mm2; MPG, 33 directions; slice thickness, 1.5 mm; and total scan time, 7 min 35 s. ADC and FA values at all consecutive points along the L4, L5 and S1 nerves were quantified on every 1.5 mm slice from the junction of the dura mater using short fiber tracking. Results: ADC values of all L4, 5, and S1 nerve roots decreased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction and was constant distally afterward. ADC values in the proximal portion demonstrated S1 > L5 > L4 (p < 0.05). On the other hand, FA values increased linearly up to 15 mm from the dura junction, and was constant distally afterward. FA values in the proximal portion showed L4 > L5 > S1 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that ADC and FA values of each L4, 5, and S1 at the proximal portion from the junction of the dura matter changed linearly. It would be useful to know the normal profile of DTI values by location of each nerve root so that we can detect subtle abnormalities in each nerve root. © 2015 Miyagi et al.

N2  - Background Peripheral neuropathies refer to a group of disorders in which there is damage to the nerves of the peripheral nervous system. Electrophysiologic studies are the main stay for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies. However, direct visualization of the nerves is possible with exact localization of site of disease with high-resolution ultrasonography (USG) and 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, and newer magnetic resonance (MR) sequences. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study including 55 patients and 64 nerves with upper limb peripheral neuropathies. All patients included underwent high-resolution focused USG of the nerves and MR neurography. A nerve conduction velocity study was performed for reference. Results The diagnostic confidence of the turbo spin echo T2-weighted (T2W) MR sequence was seen to be highest, with a sensitivity of 95.31%, whereas it was 81.25% for USG. Continuity of the nerve in patients with traumatic neuropathy was seen in 65.7% and 62.86% (22/35) nerves on MRI and USG, respectively. T1-weighted and T2W MR sequences were seen to be equally effective in establishing the continuity of the nerve. Increase in the caliber/thickening was seen in 77% of cases on MRI and 73.8% of cases on USG. Neuroma formation was seen equally on both MR and USG in 60.66%. We consistently found low fractional anisotropy (FA) values at the site of disease. Conclusions USG is a sensitive technique to diagnose peripheral neuropathies and it should be used as a screening modality for focused MR to be performed later. Turbo spin echo T2W fast spin has the highest sensitivity to identify nerve disease and is comparable with nerve conduction studies. Among the newer sequences, diffusion tensor imaging should be performed to increase diagnostic confidence. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction We investigated the applicability of nerve ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Methods We systematically examined several nerves with ultrasound and the lumbar roots and tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa of nine CIDP patients with MRI additionally to the nerve conduction studies. Results Patients with overall disability sum score (ODSS) 2-3 were characterised by normal fascicular structure in MRI and ultrasound. Patients with higher ODSS showed isolated enlarged fascicles and increased cross sectional area (CSA) of the peripheral nerves and of the diameter of the cauda equina and L5 root, whereas two of them showed atrophic fascicles in both imaging techniques. Conclusions Nerve ultrasound and MRI findings show the same morphological fascicle alterations in peripheral nerves in correlation to ODSS. Nerve ultrasound as an affordable tool, easy and quick to perform, could replace MRI in daily routine for monitoring peripheral nerve morphology.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Introduction: Differentiating multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is important, as MMN is a difficult, but treatable disorder. Methods: We studied peripheral nerve imaging techniques in differentiating MMN from ALS by measuring the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median and ulnar nerves in the forearms using high resolution ultrasound (HRUS) and MRI. Results: HRUS CSA values of the median nerve in the forearm (P = 0.002) and the ulnar nerve distal to the sulcus (P = 0.009) were significantly enlarged in patients with MMN. There was a positive correlation between CSA as measured with HRUS and MRI (Spearman rho 0.60; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Peripheral nerve imaging is a potentially powerful technique to distinguish MMN from ALS. Muscle Nerve, 2016 Muscle Nerve 54: 1133–1135, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate manganese (Mn2+)-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as tools for detection of axonal injury and regeneration after intravit-real peripheral nerve graft (PNG) implantation in the rat optic nerve (ON).Materials and Methods: In adult Fischer rats, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival was evaluated in Flurogold (FG) back-filled retinal whole mounts after ON crush (ONC), intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl 2 injection (150 nmol) at 0 and 20 days post lesion (dpl). MEMRI and echo-planar DTI (DTI-EPI) was obtained of noninjured ON one day after intravitreal MnCl2 injection, and at 1 and 21 dpl after ONC, intravitreal PNG, and intravitreal MnCl2 injections given at 0 and 20 dpl. GAP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed after the last MRI.Results: ONC reduced RGC density in retina by 94% at 21 dpl compared to noninjured ON without MnCl2 injections. Both intravitreal PNG and intravitreal MnCl2 injections improved RGC survival in retina, which was reduced by 90% (ONC + MnCl 2), 82% (ONC+PNG), and 74% (ONC+PNG+MnCl2) compared to noninjured ON. DTI-derived parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffu-sivity, axial diffusivityλ||,and radial diffusivity λ⊥) were unaffected by the presence of Mn2+ in the ON. At 1 dpl, CNRMEMRI and λ||were reduced at the injury site, while at 21 dpl they were increased at the injury site compared to values measured at 1 dpl. GAP-43 immunoreactive axons were present in the ON distal to the ONC injury site.Conclusion: MEMRI and DTI enabled detection of functional and structural degradation after rat ON injury, and there was correlation between the MRI-derived and immu-nohistochemical measures of axon regeneration. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ataxia is the commonest neurological manifestation of coeliac disease.  Some individuals with genetic susceptibility to the disease have serological evidence of gluten sensitivity without overt gastrointestinal symptoms or evidence of small-bowel inflammation. The sole manifestation of disease in such patients may be ataxia. We describe the clinical, radiological, and neurophysiological features of this disorder. METHODS: Patients with ataxia attending the neurology outpatient clinics at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK, were screened for gluten sensitivity as shown by the titre of antibody to gliadin. Those with other causes of ataxia were excluded. We carried out clinical, neurophysiological, neuroradiological, and, in two cases, neuropathological examinations. FINDINGS: 28 patients with gluten ataxia were identified. All had gait ataxia and most had limb ataxia. Those with more severe gait ataxia had longer disease duration. No patient had tremor or other extrapyramidal features. 19 patients showed some form of peripheral neuropathy on neurophysiological examination. 16 patients had no gastrointestinal symptoms. Distal duodenal biopsy showed lymphocytic infiltration in two patients, and changes compatible with coeliac disease in 11. Six patients had evidence of cerebellar atrophy on magnetic-resonance imaging. Necropsy was done on two patients who died; there was lymphocytic infiltration of the cerebellum, damage to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and sparse infiltration of the peripheral nerves. INTERPRETATION: Gluten sensitivity is an important cause of apparently idiopathic ataxia and may be progressive. The ataxia is a result of immunological damage to the cerebellum, to the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and to peripheral nerves. We propose the term gluten ataxia to describe this disorder.

N2  - Purpose: AGel amyloidosis is systemic amyloidosis caused by pathogenic
variants in the GSN gene. In this study, we sought to characterize the
clinical and brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) features of Korean
patients with AGel amyloidosis.
Materials and Methods: We examined 13 patients with AGel amyloidosis
from three unrelated families. Brain MRIs were performed in eight
patients and eight age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Therein, we
analyzed gray and white matter content using voxel-based morphometry
(VBM), tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), and FreeSurfer.
Results: The median age at examination was 73 (interquartile range: 64
& ndash;76) years. The median age at onset of cutis laxa was 20
(interquartile range: 15 & ndash;30) years. All patients over that age
of 60 years had dysarthria, cutis laxa, dysphagia, and facial palsy. Two
patients in their 30s had only mild cutis laxa. The median age at
dysarthria onset was 66 (interquartile range: 63.5 & ndash;70) years.
Ophthalmoparesis was observed in three patients. No patient presented
with muscle weakness of the limbs. Axial fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery images of the brain showed no significant differences between
the patient and control groups. Also, analysis of VBM, TBSS, and
FreeSurfer revealed no significant differences in cortical thickness
between patients and healthy controls at the corrected significance
level.
Conclusion: Our study outlines the clinical manifestations of prominent
bulbar palsy and early-onset cutis laxa in 13 Korean patients with AGel
amyloidosis and confirms that AGel amyloidosis mainly affects the
peripheral nervous system rather than the central nervous system.

N2  - Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) refers to exercise-induced, reversible increases in pressure within well-defined inelastic fascial compartments leading to compromised tissue perfusion followed by functional loss, ischemic pain, and neurologic symptoms. Symptoms typically resolve when the activity ceases and there are usually no permanent sequelae. In the upper extremity, this condition most commonly affects athletes during sports requiring repetitive and vigorous gripping, such as rowers. In addition to clinical history and examination, a number of methods aid diagnosis, including compartment pressure measurements, magnetic resonance imaging, and near infrared spectroscopy. When symptoms persist despite conservative treatment, multiple operative techniques have been described to treat CECS including open, mini-open, and endoscopic release of involved compartments. We review the pathophysiology, diagnostic modalities, treatment strategies, and outcomes data for CECS of the upper extremity while highlighting areas of residual controversy.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Surgery of the Hand

N2  - Here, we report the structural evidence of cerebral white matter abnormalities in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) patients and the relationship between these abnormalities and clinical disability. Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in CMT patients with demyelinating (CMT1A/CMT1E), axonal (CMT2A/CMT2E), or intermediate (CMTX1/DI-CMT) peripheral neuropathy. Although all patients had normal brain magnetic resonance imaging, all genetic subgroups except CMT1A had abnormal DTI findings indicative of significant cerebral white matter abnormalities: decreased fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity, and increased radial diffusivity. DTI abnormalities were correlated with clinical disability, suggesting that there is comorbidity of central nervous system damage with peripheral neuropathy in CMT patients.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the longitudinal relationship between chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms (sx) and brain perfusion changes in patients with breast cancer. Interaction of CIPN-sx perfusion effects with known chemotherapy-associated gray matter density decrease was also assessed to elucidate the relationship between CIPN and previously reported cancer treatment-related brain structural changes. Methods: Patients with breast cancer treated with (n=24) or without (n=23) chemotherapy underwent clinical examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging at the following three time points: before treatment (baseline), 1 month after treatment completion, and 1 year after the 1-month assessment. CIPN-sx were evaluated with the self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity four-item sensory-specific scale. Perfusion and gray matter density were assessed using voxel-based pulsed arterial spin labeling and morphometric analyses and tested for association with CIPN-sx in the patients who received chemotherapy. Results: Patients who received chemotherapy reported significantly increased CIPN-sx from baseline to 1 month, with partial recovery by 1 year (P <.001). CIPN-sx increase from baseline to 1 month was significantly greater for patients who received chemotherapy compared with those who did not (P=-.001). At 1 month, neuroimaging showed that for the group that received chemotherapy, CIPN-sx were positively associated with cerebral perfusion in the right superior frontal gyrus and cingulate gyrus, regions associated with pain processing (P<.001). Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging analysis in the group receiving chemotherapy indicated that CIPN-sx and associated perfusion changes from baseline to 1 month were also positively correlated with gray matter density change (P <.005). Conclusion: Peripheral neuropathy symptoms after systemic chemotherapy for breast cancer are associated with changes in cerebral perfusion and gray matter. The specific mechanisms warrant further investigation given the potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications. © 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology. All rights reserved.

N2  - Diabetic neuropathy is a chronic and often disabling condition that affects a significant number of individuals with diabetes. Long considered a disease of the peripheral nervous system, there is now increasing evidence of central nervous system involvement. Recent advances in neuroimaging methods detailed in this review have led to a better understanding and refinement of how diabetic neuropathy affects the central nervous system. Recognition that diabetic neuropathy is, in part, a disease that affects the whole nervous system is resulting in a critical rethinking of this disorder, opening a new direction for further research. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - MR-based brain imaging technologies provide a suite of functional and structural metrics that can be used to test hypotheses about the CNS mechanisms underlying pain perception and chronification, from a cellular level to a systems level. Two types of functional MRI discussed in this review provide insight into pain mechanisms: stimulus-evoked fMRI and task-free ("resting state") fMRI. The former can assess how the brain responds to noxious or non-noxious stimuli normally or in a chronic pain state as a window into understanding pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. The latter can assess functional connectivity reflecting synchronous ultra-slow frequency oscillation between brain areas. This provides insight into how brain areas work together as networks to produce pain and how these networks may be modified due to chronic pain. Perfusion MR (e.g., arterial spin labeling) can also provide task-free information pertaining to ongoing brain activity that may reflect spontaneous (ongoing) chronic pain. Structural MR techniques can be used to delineate gray and white matter abnormalities and markers of neuroinflammation associated with chronic pains. Functional and structural MRI findings point to brain and peripheral nerve abnormalities in patients with chronic pain, some of which are pre-existing and others that develop with prolonged pain (and related neuroinflammation) over time. Recent studies indicate that some structural brain abnormalities associated with chronic pain are reversible following effective pain treatment. These data together with findings from studies of individual differences suggest that some chronic pains arise from a combination of pre-existing vulnerabilities and sustained abnormal input. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the potential of MR imaging to depict morphologic alterations of the median nerve correlating with the stage of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Eighteen wrists of normal subjects and 81 wrists of patients with CTS were examined. MR imaging was performed with proton-density- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences. Staging of CTS was done on the basis of clinical and electrophysiological testing, including evaluation of the number of previous steroid infiltrations in conservative treatment. Median nerve flattening, cross-sectional area, and signal intensity were measured from the distal radius to the end of the carpal tunnel. Delineation and structure of the median nerve were recorded qualitatively by two experienced radiologists in consensus. Three major MR imaging criteria of early CTS were (a) isolated prestenotic and intracarpal swelling of the median nerve (P < .01), (b) the absence of significant flattening, and (c) a generalized increase in signal intensity retrograde to the distal radius (P < .01). The nerve showed sharply delineated contours and a homogeneous signal pattern. Advanced CTS was characterized by retrograde swelling of the median nerve to the distal radius (P < .01) and decreased signal intensity (P < .05). Demarcation of the nerve became poorer, and its signal pattern appeared fasciculated. After steroid infiltration, the median nerve was difficult to delineate, showed an inhomogeneous structure, and swelling was less pronounced than without steroid infiltration (P < .05). MR imaging yields typical morphologic findings that correlate with the duration and severity of median nerve compression. Hence, MR imaging allows staging of median nerve compression in CTS and thus may contribute to therapeutic decision-making.

N2  - Purpose: Peripheral neuropathies are a group of disorders which affect the peripheral nervous system which have been conventionally diagnosed using electrodiagnostic studies. This study was carried out to assess the role of imaging in diagnosing peripheral mononeuropathy as exact anatomical localisation of the pathology is possible using high-resolution ultrasound and MR neurography, the modalities assessed in this study. Method: A hospital-based prospective analytical study was carried out in a resource-limited setting on 180 peripheral nerves in 131 patients with symptoms of peripheral mononeuropathy after taking IRB approval. Each patient underwent high-resolution ultrasound examination and MR neurography, findings of which were then compared and statistically analysed assuming electrodiagnostic findings as the gold standard. Results: Overall, the diagnostic accuracy was highest for the proton density fat-saturated MR sequence (93.89%) followed by high-resolution ultrasound (80%). The sensitivity was highest for proton density fat-saturated sequence while the T1 MR sequence had the highest specificity. Combined diagnostic accuracy of both modalities was calculated to be 93.33% with a negative predictive value of 80%. High-resolution ultrasound and MRI equally detected the cases with nerve discontinuity, while neuromas were better identified on MRI. Conclusion: With the advent of higher frequency probes and improved MR field strength, imaging of peripheral nerves is possible with better accuracy. Imaging assessment of nerves allows anatomical delineation with identification of exact site of involvement. This comparative study demonstrates the role of imaging in diagnosing peripheral nerve pathologies with the accuracy of MRI as high as 93.89% which may serve as an imaging gold standard. High-resolution ultrasound, being quicker, cost effective and a comparable accuracy of 80% can serve as a reliable screening tool. This study incorporates a larger study group and compares HRUS with MRI, taking NCV as gold standard, which has not been done in the preceding studies. With this study, we conclude that these two imaging modalities are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they complement each other and can be used in conjunction as an imaging yardstick for diagnosing peripheral neuropathies. © 2019, The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to compare engineered nerve conduits constructed from porcine-derived urinary bladder matrix (UBM) with the criterion-standard nerve autografts, for segmental loss peripheral nerve repairs. Methods: Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups. All underwent a 10-mm sciatic nerve gap injury. This was repaired using either (1) reverse autograft - the 10-mm cut segment was oriented 180 degrees and used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps or (2) UBM conduit - the 10-mm nerve gap was bridged with UBM conduit. Behavior assessments such as sciatic function index and foot fault asymmetry scores were performed weekly. At 3-or 6-week time endpoints, the repaired nerves and bilateral gastrocnemius/soleus muscles were harvested from each animal. Nerves were evaluated using immunohistochemistry for motor and sensory axon staining and with diffusion tensor imaging. The net wet muscle weights were calculated to assess the degree of muscle atrophy. Results: The UBM group demonstrated significantly improved foot fault asymmetry scores at 2 and 4 weeks, whereas there was no difference in sciatic function index. The net muscle weights were similar between both groups. Motor axon counts proximal/inside/distal to the conduit/graft were similar between UBM conduits and reverse autografts, whereas sensory axon counts within and distal to the conduit were significantly higher than those of the autograft at 6 weeks. Sensory axonal regeneration seemed to be adherent to the inner surface of the UBM conduit, whereas it had a scattered appearance in autografts. Diffusion tensor imaging parameters between groups were similar. Conclusions: Urinary bladder matrix conduits prove to be at least similar to nerve autografts for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries with a short gap. The matrix perhaps serves as a scaffold to augment sensory nerve growth. Clinical Relevance: In a clinical setting, UBM may eliminate the donor site morbidity and increased operative time associated with nerve autografting. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Central nervous system involvement has been described in peripheral neuropathies, including different forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. The aim of our study was to systematically investigate possible brain structural modifications in CMT1A patients, using volumetric MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this prospective cross-sectional study, from May 2017 to May 2019, we acquired 3T MRI brain scans of genetically confirmed CMT1A patients and age- and sex-comparable healthy controls. Patients also underwent clinical and electrophysiological examinations assessing motor and sensory domains. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyses were performed using a non-parametric approach based on permutations, including age and sex (and total intracranial volume for VBM) as nuisance covariates. When between-group differences emerged at VBM or TBSS analyses, the first eigenvariate was extracted from the cluster and its age- and sex-adjusted standardized residuals tested for correlation with clinical and electrophysiological variables. Twenty CMT1A patients (34.5 ± 11.1 years; M/F:11/9) were enrolled, along with 20 healthy controls (30.1 ± 10.2 years; M/F:11/9). The VBM analysis revealed clusters of significantly increased GM volume in CMT1A patients compared to healthy controls, encompassing the bilateral cerebellar lobules III-VI and the left hippocampus (all ps = 0.04), with no differences in terms of DTI metrics at the TBSS analysis. A negative correlation (r = −0.502, p = 0.03) emerged between ulnar compound motor action potential and the z-scores corresponding to the right cerebellar cluster of augmented GM volume. Our data show evidence of structural reorganization in the brain of CMT1A patients, possibly reflecting neural plasticity mechanisms in response to peripheral nerve pathology and modulating the effect of axonal degeneration on functional impairment. © Copyright © 2020 Pontillo, Dubbioso, Cocozza, Tozza, Severi, Iodice, Tedeschi, Elefante, Brunetti, Manganelli and Quarantelli.

N2  - Due to the technical challenges of large-scale microscopy and analysis, to date only limited knowledge has been made available about axon morphometry (diameter, shape, myelin thickness, volume fraction), thereby limiting our understanding of neuronal microstructure and slowing down research on neurodegenerative pathologies. This study addresses this knowledge gap by establishing a state-of-the-art acquisition and analysis framework for mapping axon morphometry, and providing the first comprehensive mapping of axon morphometry in the human spinal cord. We dissected, fixed and stained a human spinal cord with osmium tetroxide, and used a scanning electron microscope to image the entirety of 23 axial slices, covering C1 to L5 spinal levels. An automatic method based on deep learning was then used to segment each axon and myelin sheath to produce maps of axon morphometry. These maps were then registered to a standard spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) template. Between 500,000 (lumbar) and 1 million (cervical) myelinated axons were segmented at each level of this human spinal cord. Morphometric features show a large disparity between tracts, but high right-left symmetry. Our results suggest a modality-based organization of the dorsal column in the human, as it has been observed in the rat. The generated axon morphometry template is publicly available at https://osf.io/8k7jr/ and could be used as a reference for quantitative MRI studies. The proposed framework for axon morphometry mapping could be extended to other parts of the central or peripheral nervous system that exhibit coherently-oriented axons. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Mutations in the NEFH gene encoding the heavy neurofilament protein are usually  associated with neuronal damage and susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recently, frameshift variants in NEFH (p.Asp1004Glnfs*58 and p.Pro1008Alafs*56) have been reported to be the underlying cause of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2CC (CMT2CC). The frameshift mutation resulted in a stop loss and translation of a cryptic amyloidogenic element (CAE) encoded by the 3' untranslated region (UTR). This study also identified a de novo c.3015_3027dup frameshift mutation predicting p.Lys1010Glnfs*57 in NEFH from a CMT2 family with an atypical clinical symptom of prominent proximal weakness. This mutation is located near the previously reported frameshift mutations, suggesting a mutational hotspot. Lower limb magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed marked hyperintense signal changes in the thigh muscles compared with those in the calf muscles. Therefore, this study suggests that the stop loss and translational elongations by the 3' UTR of the NEFH mutations may be a relatively frequent genetic cause of axonal peripheral neuropathy with the specific characteristics of proximal dominant weakness.

N2  - Background: Axonal loss denervates muscle, leading to an increase of fat accumulation in the muscle. Therefore, fat fraction (FF) in whole limb muscle using MRI has emerged as a monitoring biomarker for axonal loss in patients with peripheral neuropathies. In this study, we are testing whether deep learning-based model can automate quantification of the FF in individual muscles. While individual muscle is smaller with irregular shape, manually segmented muscle MRI images have been accumulated in this lab; and make the deep learning feasible. Purpose(s): To automate segmentation on muscle MRI images through deep learning for quantifying individual muscle FF in patients with peripheral neuropathies. Study Type: Retrospective. Subjects: 24 patients and 19 healthy controls. Field Strength/Sequences: 3T; Interleaved 3D GRE. Assessment: A 3D U-Net model was implemented in segmenting muscle MRI images. This was enabled by leveraging a large set of manually segmented muscle MRI images. B1+ and B1- maps were used to correct image inhomogeneity. Accuracy of the automation was evaluated using Pixel Accuracy (PA), Dice Coefficient (DC) in binary masks; and Bland-Altman and Pearson correlation by comparing FF values between manual and automated methods. Statistical Tests: PA and DC were reported with their median value and standard deviation. Two methods were compared using the +/- 95% confidence intervals (CI) of Bland-Altman analysis and the Pearson's coefficient (r2). Result(s): DC values were from 0.83 +/- 0.17 to 0.98 +/- 0.02 in thigh and from 0.63 +/- 0.18 to 0.96 +/- 0.02 in calf muscles. For FF values, the overall +/- 95% CI and r2 were [0.49, -0.56] and 0.989 in thigh and [0.84, -0.71] and 0.971 in the calf. Data Conclusion(s): Automated results well agreed with the manual results in quantifying FF for individual muscles. This method mitigates the formidable time consumption and intense labor in manual segmentations; and enables the use of individual muscle FF as outcome measures in upcoming longitudinal studies.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Lowering serum cholesterol levels is a well-established treatment for dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, nerve lesions in patients with T2D increase with lower serum cholesterol levels, suggesting that lowering serum cholesterol levels is associated with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in patients with T2D. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether there is an association between serum cholesterol levels and peripheral nerve lesions in patients with T2D with and without DPN. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-center, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study was performed from June 1, 2015, to March 31, 2018. Observers were blinded to clinical data. A total of 256 participants were approached, of whom 156 were excluded. A total of 100 participants consented to undergo magnetic resonance neurography of the right leg at the Department of Neuroradiology and clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic assessment at the Department of Endocrinology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. EXPOSURES Quantification of the nerve's diameter and lipid equivalent lesion (LEL) load with a subsequent analysis of all acquired clinical and serologic data with use of 3.0-Tmagnetic resonance neurography of the right leg with 3-dimensional reconstruction of the sciatic nerve. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was lesion load and extension. Secondary outcomes were clinical, serologic, and electrophysiologic findings. RESULTS A total of 100 participants with T2D (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [0.9] years; 68 [68.0%] male) participated in the study. The LEL load correlated positively with the nerve's mean cross-sectional area (r = 0.44; P < .001) and the maximum length of a lesion (r = 0.71; P < .001). The LEL load was negatively associated with total serum cholesterol level (r = -0.41; P < .001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = -0.30; P = .006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = -0.33; P = .003), nerve conduction velocities of the tibial (r = -0.33; P = .01) and peroneal (r = -0.51; P < .001) nerves, and nerve conduction amplitudes of the tibial (r = -0.31; P = .02) and peroneal (r = -0.28; P = .03) nerves. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings suggest that lowering serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D and DPN is associated with a higher amount of nerve lesions and declining nerve conduction velocities and amplitudes. These findings may be relevant to emerging therapies that promote an aggressive lowering of serum cholesterol levels in patients with T2D.Copyright © 2019 JAMA Network Open.All right reserved.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and interobserver performance of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and detect correlations with electrophysiology. Method(s): Twelve healthy volunteers (controls) and ten DPN patients were enrolled to undergo MR examinations. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of tibial nerve (TN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were measured. Unpaired t test and Levene tests were performed to assess differences between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for FA and ADC values. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between DTI and electrophysiology parameters in the patient group. Result(s): The FA values of TN and CPN in the DPN group were significantly lower and ADC were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). Interobserver agreement was excellent. FA positively correlated and ADC negatively correlated with motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between motor nerve conduction amplitude and DTI parameters (p > 0.05). Moderate diagnostic accuracy of DTI was seen in the diagnosis of DPN. Conclusion(s): DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy and excellent interobserver performance in the detection of DPN involving the TN and CPN. There is moderate correlation with MCV. Key Points: * FA values of TN and CPN are significantly lower in DPN. * ADC values of TN and CPN are significantly higher in DPN. * DTI demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy in detection of DPN. * There is excellent interobserver performance in DTI measurements. * Moderate correlation is seen between DTI parameters and MCV.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.

N2  - Introduction: The immune system plays a pivotal role in nerve injury. The aim of this study was to determine the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluation of the synergic effect of immunomodulation on nerve regeneration in neurotmesis. Methods: Rats with sciatic nerve neurotmesis and surgical repair underwent serial multiparametric MR examinations over an 8-week period after subepineurial microinjection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequent subcutaneous injection of FK506 or subepineurial microinjection of LPS or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone. Results: Nerves treated with immunomodulation showed more prominent regeneration than those treated with LPS or PBS alone and more rapid restoration toward normal T2, fractional anisotropy (FA), and radial diffusivity (RD) values than nerves injected with LPS or PBS. Discussion: Nerves treated with immunomodulation exert synergic beneficial effects on nerve regeneration that can be predicted by T2 measurements and FA and RD values.

N2  - Purpose Given no definite consensus on the accepted autograft orientation during peripheral nerve injury repair, we compare outcomes between reverse and normally oriented autografts using an advanced magnetic resonance imaging technique, diffusion tensor imaging. Methods Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: sham - left sciatic nerve isolation without injury, reverse autograft - 10-mm cut left sciatic nerve segment reoriented 180° and used to coapt the proximal and distal stumps, or normally oriented autograft - 10-mm cut nerve segment kept in its normal orientation for coaptation. Animals underwent sciatic functional index and foot fault behavior studies at 72 hours, and then weekly. At 6 weeks, axons proximal, within, and distal to the autograft were evaluated using diffusion tensor imaging and choline acetyltransferase motor staining for immunohistochemistry. Toluidine blue staining of 1-μm sections was used to assess axon count, density, and diameter. Bilateral gastrocnemius/soleus muscle weights were compared to obtain a net wet weight. Comparison of the groups was performed using Mann-Whiney U or Kruskal-Wallis H tests to determine significance. Results Diffusion tensor imaging findings including fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity were similar between reverse and normally oriented autografts. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography demonstrated proximodistal nerve regeneration in both autograft groups. Motor axon counts proximal, within, and distal to the autografts were similar. Likewise, axon count, density, and diameter were similar between the autograft groups. Muscle net weight at 6 weeks and behavioral outcomes (sciatic functional index and foot fault) at any tested time point were also similar between reverse and normally oriented autografts. Conclusions Diffusion tensor imaging may be a useful assessment tool for peripheral nerve regeneration. Reversing nerve autograft polarity did not demonstrate to have an influence on functional or regenerative outcomes. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: To assess the value of reduced field of view (rFOV) imaging in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography of the lumbar nerve roots at 3 T from the perspective of future clinical trials. Methods: DTI images of the lumbar nerves were obtained in eight healthy volunteers, with and without the rFOV technique. Non-coplanar excitation and refocusing pulses associated with outer volume suppression (OVS) were used to achieve rFOV imaging. Tractography was performed. A visual evaluation of image quality was made by two observers, both senior musculoskeletal radiologists. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured in L5 and S1 roots. Results: rFOV images of the L5 and S1 roots were assessed as being superior to full FOV (fFOV) images. Image quality was rated as good to excellent by both observers. Interobserver agreement was good. No significant difference was found in FA and ADC measurements of the L5 or S1 roots. On the contrary, only poor-quality images could be obtained with fFOV imaging as major artefacts were present. Conclusion: The rFOV approach was essential to achieve high-quality DTI imaging of lumbar nerve roots on 3-T MRI. Key Points: • Diffusion tensor 3-T MR imaging of lumbar nerve roots creates severe artefacts. • A reduced field of view drastically reduces artefacts, thereby improving image quality. • Good-quality tractography images can even be obtained with rFOV imaging. • rFOV DTI is better than fFOV DTI for clinical studies. © 2012 European Society of Radiology.

N2  - The ability to investigate microstructural properties of the central nervous system with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown in many studies. More recently, DTI is being applied outside the brain showing promising results, for instance, for investigating muscle tissue. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography to study the nerves of the sacral plexus in humans in vivo and to assess the architectural configuration and microstructural properties of these peripheral nerves. For this research goal we optimized the acquisition parameters of a DTI sequence and acquired data from 10 healthy adults and one 12-year patient having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. For the healthy volunteers, we estimated the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial diffusivities (RD) of the sacral plexus nerves which may serve as a baseline for future studies. We demonstrated that tractography of the sacral plexus on a 3 Tesla MR scanner is feasible, giving 3D insight in the general anatomy and organization of the nerves L4 to S3. In addition, branches to the pudendal nerve were also found in 4 volunteers. There were no significant differences in any of the estimated diffusion measures between the right and left sided nerves or between the nerves L4 to S3 on an intra-subject basis. Furthermore, clinical feasibility of DTI and tractography in a child having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction is demonstrated. The architectural configuration of the child's sacral plexus was comparable with the healthy volunteers and no significant disrupted nerve fibers were observed. However, there are strong indications that abnormal diffusion characteristics are present at the level of the neural tube defect due to incomplete segments of the nerves that are close to the vertebrae. These findings are encouraging for using DTI as a means to investigate changes in microstructural properties of the nerves of the sacral plexus. Moreover, this new methodology may provide a new avenue to a better analysis and diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunctions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Many studies have demonstrated that combining nerve conduits with neural stem cells or growth factors can repair peripheral nerve injury in rodents. However, nerve damage does occur with longer gaps in human than in rodents, thus findings from rodent studies are difficult to translate to clinical practice. Minipigs have a longer gap that is more closely applicable to the challenge of human nerve grafting in extensive traumatic nerve damage. In this study, human amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSCs) and polylactate nerve conduits were used to repair sciatic nerve injury in minipigs. The AFSCs exhibited the properties of mesenchymal stem cells with a propensity toward neural stem cells. Measurements of compound muscle action potential implied that administration of conduits with AFSCs was beneficial in function recovery in the minipig model compared with conduits alone. The results of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) based fiber tractography assay in the minipig model suggest that combining AFSCs with conduits could expedite the repair of sciatic nerve injury. Further, MR-based DTI provides an effective and non-invasive method to visualize the sciatic nerve and to monitor the regeneration progress of injured nerve in a longitudinal study. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Although the diffusivity and anisotropy of water has been investigated thoroughly in ordered axonal systems (i.e., nervous tissue), there have been very few studies on the directional dependence of diffusion of metabolites. In this study, the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (Trace/3 ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the intracellular metabolites N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine and phosphocreatine (tCr), choline (Cho), taurine (Tau), and glutamate and glutamine (Glx) were measured parallel and perpendicular to the length of excised frog sciatic nerve using a water suppressed, diffusion-weighted, spin-echo pulse sequence at 18.8 T. The degree of anisotropy (FA) of NAA (0.41 ± 0.09) was determined to be less than tCr (0.59 ± 0.07) and Cho (0.61 ± 0.11), which is consistent with previously reported human studies of white matter. In contrast, Glx diffusion was found to be almost isotropic with an FA value of 0.20 ± 0.06. The differences of FA between the metabolites is most likely due to their differing micro-environments and could be beneficial as an indicator of compartment specific changes with disease, information not readily available with water diffusion. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: Magnetostimulation, also known as peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), is the dominant safety constraint in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the gradient magnetic fields that operate around 0.1–1 kHz, and for the homogeneous drive field in magnetic particle imaging (MPI) that operates around 10–150 kHz. Previous studies did not report correlations between anatomical measures and magnetostimulation thresholds for the gradient magnetic fields in MRI. In contrast, a strong linear correlation was shown between the thresholds and the inverse of body part size in MPI. Yet, the effects of other anatomical measures on the thresholds for the drive field remain unexplored. Here, we investigate the effects of fat percentage on magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range homogeneous magnetic fields such as the drive field in MPI, with the ultimate goal of predicting subject-specific thresholds based on simple anatomical measures. Methods: Human subject experiments were performed on the upper arms of 10 healthy male subjects (age: 26 ± 2 yr) to determine magnetostimulation thresholds. Experiments were repeated three times for each subject, with brief resting periods between repetitions. Using a solenoidal magnetostimulation coil, a homogeneous magnetic field at 25 kHz with 100 ms pulse duration was applied at 4-s intervals, while the subject reported stimulation via a mouse click. To determine the thresholds, individual subject responses were fitted to a cumulative distribution function modeled by a sigmoid curve. Next, anatomical images of the upper arms of the subjects were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner. A two-point Dixon method was used to obtain separate images of water and fat tissues, from which several anatomical measures were derived: the effective outer radius of the upper arm, the effective inner radius (i.e., the muscle radius), and fat percentage. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the threshold and anatomical measures. This statistical analysis was repeated after factoring out the expected effects of body part size. An updated model for threshold prediction is provided, where in addition to scaling in proportion with the inverse of the outer radius, the threshold has an affine dependence on fat percentage. Results: A strong linear correlation (r = 0.783, P < 0.008) was found between magnetostimulation threshold and fat percentage, and the correlation became stronger after factoring out the effects of outer radius (r = 0.839, P < 0.003). While considering body part size alone did not explain any significant variance in measured thresholds (P > 0.398), the updated model that also incorporates fat percentage yielded substantially improved threshold predictions with (Formula presented.) = 0.654 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This work shows for the first time that fat percentage strongly correlates with magnetostimulation thresholds for kHz-range homogenous magnetic fields such as the drive field in MPI, and that the correlations get even stronger after factoring out the effects of body part size. These results have important practical implications for predicting subject-specific thresholds, which in turn can increase the performance of the drive field and improve image quality while remaining within the safety limits. © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine

N2  - Accumulated evidence from experimental animal models suggests that neuronal loss within the dorsal horn is involved in the development and/or maintenance of peripheral neuropathic pain. However, to date, no study has specifically investigated whether such neuroanatomical changes also occur at this level in humans. Using brain imaging techniques, we sought to determine whether anatomical changes were present in the spinal trigeminal nucleus in subjects with chronic orofacial neuropathic pain. In 22 subjects with painful trigeminal neuropathy and 44 pain-free controls, voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted anatomical images and diffusion tensor images were used to assess regional gray matter volume and microstructural changes within the brainstem. In addition, deterministic tractography was used to assess the integrity of ascending pain pathways. Orofacial neuropathic pain was associated with significant regional gray matter volume decreases, fractional anisotropy increases, and mean diffusivity decreases within the spinal trigeminal nucleus, specifically the subnucleus oralis. In addition, tractography revealed no significant differences in diffusivity properties in the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve, the spinal trigeminal tract, or the ventral trigeminothalamic tracts in painful trigeminal neuropathy subjects compared with controls. These data reveal that chronic neuropathic pain in humans is associated with discrete alterations in the anatomy of the primary synapse. These neuroanatomical changes may be critical for the generation and/or maintenance of pathological pain. © 2015 the authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A number of benign and malignant peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions produce similar imaging features on conventional anatomic MR imaging. Functional MR imaging using DTI can increment the diagnostic performance in differentiation of these lesions. Our aim was to evaluate the role of 3T anatomic MR imaging and DTI in the characterization of peripheral nerve tumor and tumorlike conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (13 men, 16 women; mean age, 41±18 years; range, 11- 83 years) with a nerve tumor or tumorlike condition (25 benign, 5 malignant) underwent 3T MR imaging by using anatomic (n=29), functional diffusion, DWI (n=21), and DTI (n=24) techniques. Images were evaluated for image quality (3-point scale), ADC of the lesion, tractography, and fractional anisotropy of nerves with interobserver reliability in ADC and FA measurements. RESULTS: Nosignificant differences were observed in age (benign, 40±18 versus malignant, 45±19 years) and sex (benign, male/female= 12:12 versus malignant, male/female=3:2) (P&gt;.05). All anatomic (29/29, 100%)MRimaging studies received 'good' quality; 20/21 (95%) DWI and 21/24 (79%) DTI studies received 'good' quality. ADC of benign lesions (1.848 ± 0.40 × 10-3 mm2/s) differed from that of malignant lesions (0.900 ± 0.25 × 10-3 mm2/s, P &lt; .001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.988 [95% CI, 0.976-0.994]). There were no FA or ADC differences between men and women (P&gt;.05). FA of involved nerves was lower than that in contralateral healthy nerves (P&lt; .001) with excellent interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.970 [95% CI, 0.946-0.991]). ADC on DTI and DWI was not statistically different (P &gt; .05), with excellent intermethod reliability (ICC = 0.943 [95% CI, 0.836-0.980]). Tractography differences were observed in benign and malignant lesions. CONCLUSIONS: 3T MR imaging and DTI are valuable methods for anatomic and functional evaluation of peripheral nerve lesions with excellent interobserver reliability. While tractography and low FA provide insight into neural integrity, low diffusivity values indicate malignancy in neural masses.

N2  - Purpose Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the
leading cause of death for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
Identification of hypermetabolic lesions on PET may help identify
patients at risk for MPNST. The objective of this study was to identify
clinical and MRI-derived variables that predicted increased metabolic
activity of neurofibromas in NF1 patients as determined by PET.
Methods This prospective study included NF1 patients with neurofibromas
of 5 cm in diameter or greater. All patients underwent whole-body MRI
and F-18-FDG PET imaging. Tumor volume was calculated from the MR scans
using a semiautomated 3-dimensional segmentation method. SUVmax's were
calculated to quantify metabolic activity. Logistic regression analyses
were performed to determine the relationship among SUVmax, tumor volume,
location (extremity vs trunk), type (plexiform vs circumscribed), depth
(superficial vs deep), patient age, and whole-body tumor burden.
Results A total of 311 neurofibromas were identified in 19 NF1 patients
(mean age, 38 years; range, 19-58 years). One extreme outlier was
excluded from analysis. Whole-body tumor volumes ranged from 0.4 to
1182.4 mL. Fifty of 310 tumors were FDG-avid on PET (16%) with median
SUVmax of 2.2 (range, 0.4-9.6). Metabolic activity (SUVmax >2.5)
correlated with tumor location (deep > superficial, trunk > extremity)
in tumors with PET avidity.
Conclusions In NF1 patients with neurofibromas of 5 cm or greater, the
majority of internal tumors are not metabolically active on PET. Tumors
with increased metabolic activity as defined by SUVmax greater than 2.5
(ie, suggestive of MPNST) are more likely to be deep and located within
the trunk.

N2  - From time to time it is thoughtful and productive to review a medical field and reflect upon what are the major issues that need to be addressed and what is being done to do so. This review article is not meant to be all-inclusive but rather focuses on four evolving areas in the field of peripheral nerve disorders and treatments: (1) nerve surgery under ultrasound guidance using a new ultra-minimally invasive thread technique; (2) evolving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging techniques that are helping to both diagnose and treat a variety of peripheral nerve problems including entrapment neuropathies, traumatic nerve injuries, and masses arising from nerves; (3) promoting recovery after nerve injury using electrical stimulation; and (4) developing animal models to reproduce a severe nerve injury (neurotmetic grade in continuity) that requires a surgical intervention and repair. In each area we first describe the current challenges and then discuss new and emerging techniques and approaches. It is our hope that this article will bring added attention and resources to help better address peripheral nerve problems that remain a challenge for both patients and physicians.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.

N2  - Objective Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common median nerve entrapment neuropathy characterized by pain, paresthesias, diminished peripheral nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and maladaptive functional brain neuroplasticity. We evaluated structural reorganization in brain gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) and whether such plasticity is linked to altered median nerve function in CTS. Methods We performed NCV testing, T1-weighted structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 28 CTS and 28 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) contrasted regional GM volume for CTS versus HC. Significant clusters were correlated with clinical metrics and served as seeds to define associated WM tracts using DTI data and probabilistic tractography. Within these WM tracts, fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivity were evaluated for group differences and correlations with clinical metrics. Results For CTS subjects, GM volume was significantly reduced in contralesional S1 (hand-area), pulvinar and frontal pole. GM volume in contralesional S1 correlated with median NCV. NCV was also correlated with RD and was negatively correlated with FA within U-fiber cortico-cortical association tracts identified from the contralesional S1 VBM seed. Conclusions Our study identified clear morphometric changes in the CTS brain. This central morphometric change is likely secondary to peripheral nerve pathology and altered somatosensory afference. Enhanced axonal coherence and myelination within cortico-cortical tracts connecting primary somatosensory and motor areas may accompany peripheral nerve deafferentation. As structural plasticity was correlated with NCV and not symptomatology, the former may be a better determinant of appropriate clinical intervention for CTS, including surgery. © 2013 The Authors.

N2  - The aim of the study was to determine the age-related morphometric
features of the thalamus in mesocrane men in young, old and senile age
using magnetic resonance imaging data. The analysis of the results of
morphometric study of the thalamus using the method of magnetic
resonance imaging of 73 mesocrane men aged 27 to 83 years without
diseases and injuries of the Central and peripheral nervous system, who
do not have a history of alcohol and drug dependence, with a
predominance of the right hand (right-handed), with no signs of
pathology of the brain departments detected during the study. The
transverse, longitudinal and vertical dimensions of the thalamus were
determined. In the time period from young to old age, mesocrane men
showed a decrease in the parameters of all linear sizes of the thalamus
(p<0.001). In the young, elderly, and senile ages in the left
hemisphere, there is a tendency for the predominance of parameters of
the transverse, longitudinal and vertical dimensions of the thalamus in
comparison with the right hemisphere (p>0.05). The results obtained can
be used as a reference for the age-related anatomical norm of the size
of the thalamus in mesocrane men in young, elderly, and senile ages and
will be useful for radiologists when conducting magnetic resonance
imaging studies of brain structures.

N2  - Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) are neoplasms derived from neoplastic Schwann cells or their precursors. Whereas benign PNSTs are relatively common and considered curable lesions, their malignant counterparts are rare but highly aggressive and require early diagnosis and treatment. MR imaging has been the modality of choice for noninvasive evaluation of PNSTs. This article discusses the features of PNSTs in conventional and advanced MR imaging, and it emphasizes the features that help differentiate benign and malignant variants. © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

N2  - Objectives: This study evaluated the potential of three-tesla diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography to detect changes of the radial (RN) and median (MN) nerves during transient upper arm compression by a silicon ring tourniquet. Methods: Axial T2-weighted and DTI sequences (b = 700 s/mm2, 16 gradient encoding directions) of 13 healthy volunteers were obtained. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the MN and RN were measured at the spiral groove and further visualized in 3D by deterministic tractography (thresholds: FA =.15, angle change = 27°). Results: Local/lesional RN FA values increased (p = 0.001) and ADC values decreased (p = 0.02) during a 20-min upper arm compression, whereas no significant FA (p = 0.49) or ADC (p = 0.73) changes of the MN were detected. There were no T2-w nerve signal changes or alterations of nerve trajectories in 3D. Conclusions: Acute nerve compression of the RN leads to changes of its three-tesla DTI metrics. Peripheral nerve DTI provides non-invasive insights into the “selective” vulnerability of the RN at the spiral groove. Key Points: • DTI-based neurography detects nerve changes during acute nerve compression. • Compression leads to a transient increase in local radial nerve FA values. • DTI provides insights into radial nerve vulnerability at the spiral groove. © 2015, European Society of Radiology.

N2  - A 7-year-old female presented with fever, urinary incontinence, mental regression,  gait disturbance, and lethargy after diarrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal T(2)-weighted hypersignal lesions supportive of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Her mother had been diagnosed with hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsy. The girl was also determined to have hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy, with a 1.5-Mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2 encompassing the gene for peripheral myelin protein 22 detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Hereditary peripheral neuropathies may be a factor in triggering the autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system.

N2  - Background: Acquired copper deficiency in adults is associated with a subacute to chronic progressive myeloneuropathy and optic neuropathy. Objective(s): To describe an individual after gastric bypass surgery who developed a chronic progressive myeloneuropathy, an acute optic neuropathy, along with anemia and leukopenia. Design(s): Case report. Setting(s): Academic center. Patient(s): A 55-year-old woman, following gastric bypass surgery 22 years earlier, developed progressive numbness, weakness, and sphincter disturbance over 6 years. She awoke one morning with bilateral blindness. Examination findings showed evidence of severe myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Magnetic resonance imaging, optical coherence tomography, electrophysiologic studies, nerve and muscle biopsy specimens, and vision testing. Result(s): Over 1 year of follow-up, copper infusion therapy seemed to stabilize the progressive myeloneuropathy and improved leukopenia and anemia. It had no effect on the optic neuropathy. Optic nerve tissue injury was observed on magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and on optical coherence tomography. Conclusion(s): Copper deficiency should be considered in cases of atypical optic neuropathy. Serum copper levels should be monitored in patients with a compatible neurologic syndrome who have undergone gastric bypass surgery. Although visual acuity did not improve after copper infusion in our patient, prompt recognition of copper deficiency may prevent further deterioration. ©2009 American Medical Association.

N2  - Background: Diabetic neuropathy is the commonest chronic disabling complication of diabetes which may lead to amputation and compromising patient's quality of life. It is characterized by pain, sensation loss associated with neural edema. Diffusion tensor imaging parameter i.e. fraction anisotropy determines the free water proton diffusion in the healthy nerve. Since the diabetes leads to altered mechanosensitivity of the posterior tibial nerve thereby, might interferes with the water molecules movement. Therefore the present clinical trial will provide the evidence of improving the diffusion tensor imaging in the diabetic neuropathy directly by targeting the nerve through nerve mobilization treatment. Methods: Participants with Type II Diabetes Mellitus induced peripheral neuropathy will be selected randomly on the basis of eligibility criteria and informed consent will be taken. Participants will be recruited into three groups. Group A (experimental group A) will receive neural mobilization technique, Group B (experimental group B) will receive conventional therapy and Group C (control group) will receive sham treatment for 3 weeks. MRI technique, Visual analogue scale and neuropathy specific quality of life questionnaire will be used as assessment tools. Assessment will be taken at baseline and post intervention. Conclusion: this clinical trial will provide the evidence of efficacy of nerve mobilization in determining the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes in the posterior tibial nerve in patients with diabetic neuropathy. This trial will also be the first one in itself to look at the treatment induced DTI changes in the peripheral nerve.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the evaluation of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) compared to clinical scores and nerve conduction studies (NCS). Patients and methods: We included 30 patients with diabetes mellitus complaining of neuropathy symptoms and 15 healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent evaluation using 1.5-T DTI of median nerves and NCS. Patients underwent clinical evaluation using the Neuropathy Deficit Score (NDS), Neuropathy Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL), and Diabetic Neuropathy Examination (DNE) score. Results: We found statistically significant differences between healthy volunteers and patients in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the distal segment (P = 0.016) and whole median nerve (P = 0.024), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of proximal (P = 0.027) and distal (P < 0.001) segments, and whole median nerve (P = 0.019). Distal segment FA was significantly correlated with NDS (P = 0.003), DNEs (P = 0.003), sensory amplitude (P = 0.048), and motor CV (P = 0.020). Distal segment ADC was significantly correlated with NDS (P = 0.007), NIS-LL (P = 0.003), DNEs (P = 0.01), and sensory amplitude (P = 0.032). The best cut-off value of distal segment for FA was 0.45 (87% sensitivity, 80% specificity) and of distal segment ADC was 1.217 (80% sensitivity and specificity). Conclusions: Our results suggest that 1.5-T DTI examination of the median nerve can provide useful non-invasive information in patients with DPN. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03934970.

N2  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective motor neuron degeneration in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. It is generally accepted that ALS is caused by death of motor neurons, however the exact temporal cascade of degenerative processes is not yet completely known. To identify the early pathological changes in spinal cord of G93A-SOD1 ALS mice we performed a comprehensive longitudinal analysis employing diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging alongside histology and electron microscopy, in parallel with peripheral nerve histology. We showed the gradient of degeneration appearance in spinal cord white and gray matter, starting earliest in the ventral white matter, due to a cascade of pathological events including axon dysfunction and mitochondrial changes. Notably, we found that even the main sensory regions are affected by the neurodegenerative process at symptomatic disease phase. Overall our results attest the applicability of DTI in determining disease progression in ALS mice. These findings suggest that DTI could be potentially adapted in humans to aid the assessment of ALS progression and eventually the evaluation of treatment efficacy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the common peripheral
neuropathies. For magnetic resonance imaging, segmentation of the carpal
tunnel and its contents, including flexor tendons and the median nerve
for magnetic resonance images is an important issue. In this study, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which was modified by the
original DeepLabv3 + model to segment three primary structures of the
carpal tunnel: the carpal tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve.
Methods To extract important feature maps for segmentation of the carpal
tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve, the proposed CNN model termed
modified DeepLabv3 + uses DenseNet-121 as a backbone and adds dilated
convolution to the original spatial pyramid pooling module. A MaskTrack
method was used to refine the segmented results generated by modified
DeepLabv3 +, which have a small and blurred appearance. For evaluation
of the segmentation results, the average Dice similarity coefficients
(ADSC) were used as the performance index.
Results Sixteen MR images corresponding to different subjects were
obtained from the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Our proposed
modified DeepLabv3 + generated the following ADSCs: 0.928 for carpal
tunnel, 0.872 for flexor tendons and 0.785 for the median nerve. The
ADSC value of 0.8053 generated the MaskTrack that 0.22 ADSC measure were
improved for measuring the median nerve.
Conclusions The experimental results showed that the proposed modified
DeepLabv3 + model can promote segmentations of the carpal tunnel and its
contents. The results are superior to the results generated by original
DeepLabv3 +. Additionally, MaskTrack can also effectively refine median
nerve segmentations.

N2  - Diagnosis and management of peripheral nerve injury is complicated by the inability to assess microstructural features of injured nerve fibers via clinical examination and electrophysiology. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown to accurately detect nerve injury and regeneration in crush models of peripheral nerve injury, but no prior studies have been conducted on nerve transection, a surgical emergency that can lead to permanent weakness or paralysis. Acute sciatic nerve injuries were performed microsurgically to produce multiple grades of nerve transection in rats that were harvested 1 hour after surgery. High-resolution diffusion tensor images from ex vivo sciatic nerves were obtained using diffusion-weighted spin-echo acquisitions at 4.7 T. Fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced at the injury sites of transected rats compared with sham rats. Additionally, minor eigenvalues and radial diffusivity were profoundly elevated at all injury sites and were negatively correlated to the degree of injury. Diffusion tensor tractography showed discontinuities at all injury sites and significantly reduced continuous tract counts. These findings demonstrate that high-resolution DTI is a promising tool for acute diagnosis and grading of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries. © AANS, 2015.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for pathologies of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) through clinical, electrophysiological and morphological evaluation of the median nerve. Methods: The present work was a multilevel prospective study involving 30 subjects, 15 of whom had carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and 15 healthy controls. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation through administration of the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), electroneurography (ENG), 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging with DTI, and calculation of fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at the flexor retinaculum. Tractography was also performed for three-dimensional reconstruction of the route of the median nerve through the carpal tunnel. The degree of functional impairment was compared with the anatomical damage to the median nerve according to ENG and DTI. Results: FA and ADC were significantly correlated with ENG parameters of CTS and BCTQ data. Mean FA and ADC values in the CTS patients were 0.359±0.06 and 1.866±0.050×10-3mm2/s, respectively, vs 0.59±0.014 and 1.395±0.035×10-3mm2/s, respectively, in the controls. FA was decreased and ADC increased in patients with CTS compared with healthy controls (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: DTI parameters were clearly confirmed by both clinical and ENG data and, therefore, may be used for the diagnosis of CTS. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) also known as Spinocerebellar ataxia type
3, is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease associated with severe
clinical manifestations and premature death. Although rare, it is the
most common autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide and has
a distinct geographic distribution, reaching peak prevalence in certain
regions of Brazil, Portugal and China. Due to its clinical
heterogeneity, it was initially described as several different entities
and as had many designations over the last decades. An accurate
diagnosis become possible in 1994, after the identification of the MJD1
gene. Among its wide clinical spectrum, progressive cerebellar ataxia is
normally present. Other symptoms include pyramidal syndrome, peripheral
neuropathy, oculomotor abnormalities, extrapyramidal signs and sleep
disorders. On the basis of the presence/absence of important
extra-pyramidal signs, and the presence/absence of peripheral signs,
five clinical types have been defined. Neuroimaging studies like MRI,
DTI and MRS, can be useful as they can characterize structural and
functional differences in specific subgroups of patients with MJD. There
is no effective treatment for MJD. Symptomatic therapies are used to
relieve some of the clinical symptoms and physiotherapy is also helpful
in improving quality of live. Several clinical trials have been carried
out using different molecules like sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim,
varenicline and lithium carbonate, but the results of these trials were
negative or showed little benefit. Future studies sufficiently powered
and adequately designed are warranted.
