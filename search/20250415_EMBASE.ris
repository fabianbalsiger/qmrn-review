N2  - This focused review concentrates on eight topics of high importance for Gaucher disease (GD) clinicians and researchers: 1) The consideration of GD as distinct types rather than a spectrum. A review of the literature clearly supports the view that there are distinct types of GD. Type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic involvement, while types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive primary neuronopathic disease. 2) Neurologic and neuronopathic manifestations. A growing body of evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system may be involved in GD type 1 and that there may also be signs and symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disease in this group. However, GD type 1 is characterized by the absence of primary neuronopathic disease, whereas GD types 2 and 3 are characterized by progressive, albeit variable, primary neuronopathic disease. Abnormalities in saccadic eye movements have been suggested as being diagnostic for neuronopathic GD, but they may also occur in GD type 1 and in other inflammatory diseases. 3) The importance of whole GBA1 sequencing. This approach is superior to exome sequencing because of potential effects of deep intronic variants on gene expression. It also has the capacity to detect variant alleles that might be missed with gene panels. 4) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The risks of MGUS, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are elevated in patients with GD compared to the general population and strong evidence indicates that lyso-Gb1 stimulates the formation of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein) in patients with GD and MGUS. 5) Pulmonary involvement in GD. Pulmonary complications can be identified through spirometry in up to 45 % of patients with GD type 1 and 55 % of those with GD type 3. Limited evidence exists that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) reduces the severity of these complications in patients with GD type 1. 6) Gaucheromas. These may occur in patients with GD types 1 or 3, but there is little detailed information about their inception, mechanisms underlying growth, cellular organization, and biochemical activities, and no definitive guidance for their management. Gaucheromas behave like benign (i.e. non-metastasizing) neoplasms, and it may be reasonable to classify them as such. 7) Bone and joint involvement. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans alone are insufficient for monitoring all changes in bone that may occur in patients with GD. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques using Dixon quantitative chemical shift imaging have provided results that correlate with GD severity scores, bone complications, and biomarkers for GD bone involvement. Thoracic kyphosis is a common complication of GD types 1 and 3, and there is very limited information regarding the effects of ERT or substrate synthesis inhibition therapy (SSIT) on this condition. 8) Treatment initiation, selection, combination, and switching. Prompt initiation of treatment in pediatric patients is important as GD can lead to impaired growth, lower peak bone mass, and delayed puberty. These adverse outcomes can often be ameliorated or prevented with timely treatment. Either ERT or eliglustat, a SSIT agent, is suitable as first-line treatment of adults with GD. Studies of switching from ERT to eliglustat, or between different ERT products, have indicated that changing treatment is safe, although efficacy outcomes vary. A critical remaining issue is the lack of treatments capable of reaching the CNS to slow or halt the progression of neuronopathic disease in patients with GD type 2 or 3 and potentially reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease in GD type 1 patients and heterozygotes for GBA1 variants.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and its parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) are increasingly being used to assess peripheral nerve integrity alongside nerve conduction studies. This pilot study aims to compare DTI values of lumbar spinal nerve roots before (T0) and after (T1) treatment with an interspinous process device (IPD). Seven patients (5 females, 2 males; mean age: 68) suffering from neurogenic claudication and lumbar spinal canal and foraminal stenosis were evaluated. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for perceived pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and DTI parameters were assessed between T0 and T1. No significant difference in FA was found in treated roots, while MD (p = 0.0015), RD (p = 0.0032), and AD (p = 0.0221) were significantly altered. At untreated levels, all DTI parameters showed highly significant differences (p < 0.0001) between T0 and T1. In treated roots, FA values significantly increased in the intraforaminal segment(p = 0.0229), while MD(p = 0.0124), AD(p = 0.0128), and RD (p = 0.0143) values decreased in the pre-foraminal segment. In untreated roots, FA significantly increased in pre(p = 0.0039)and intraforaminal(p = 0.0003) segments, and MD, AD, and RD decreased in all segments (p < 0.0001). VAS (p < 0.0001) also decreased between T0 and T1. This pilot study aims to clarify the biomechanical impact of interspinous spacers through microstructural analysis of both treated and adjacent untreated nerve roots. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the short- to medium-term changes in DTI values of lumbar nerve roots before and after IPD placement, or compared changes between treated and untreated roots.

N2  - Neurofibromatosis (NF) type I is a neuroectodermal and mesodermal dysplasia caused by a mutation of the neurofibromin tumor suppressor gene. Phenotypic features of NF1 vary, and patients develop benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors and malignant neoplasms, such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, malignant melanoma, and astrocytoma. Multiparametric whole-body MR imaging (WBMRI) plays a critical role in disease surveillance. Multiparametric MRI, typically used in prostate imaging, is a general term for a technique that includes multiple sequences, i.e. anatomic, diffusion, and Dixon-based pre- and post-contrast imaging. This article discusses the value of multiparametric WBMRI and illustrates the spectrum of whole-body lesions of NF1 in a single imaging setting. Examples of lesions include those in the skin (tumors and axillary freckling), soft tissues (benign and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, visceral plexiform, and diffuse lesions), bone and joints (nutrient nerve lesions, non-ossifying fibromas, intra-articular neurofibroma, etc.), spine (acute-angled scoliosis, dural ectasia, intraspinal tumors, etc.), and brain/skull (optic nerve glioma, choroid plexus xanthogranuloma, sphenoid wing dysplasia, cerebral hamartomas, etc.). After reading this article, the reader will gain knowledge of the variety of lesions encountered with NF1 and their WBMRI appearances. Timely identification of such lesions can aid in accurate diagnosis and appropriate patient management.

N2  - Background: Spin-echo Cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI)1 is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limited, in part due to the long motion-compensated (velocity and acceleration, M1+M2) diffusion encoding gradient waveforms that extend echo times (TEs). Ultra-high-performance MRI systems (e.g. Gmax=200mT/m, Smax=200T/m/s) are a great opportunity for cDTI to minimize TEs and increase SNR; however, peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) from slewing to higher gradient thresholds needs to be managed. Gradient waveform optimization, such as the open-source Gradient Optimization toolbox (GrOpt2), provides more time-efficient gradient waveforms while managing constraints. The wider adoption of cDTI and SNR-efficient optimized gradient waveform approaches are limited by specialized sequence development in proprietary vendor software. Pulseq3 is another open-source toolbox that enables vendor-neutral pulse sequence programming in Matlab or Python,4 lowering the barrier for design. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate an open-source approach to spin-echo cDTI data collection using a combination of GrOpt and Pulseq. Methods: In simulation, the minimum TE achievable for a spin-echo cDTI sequence was simulated for an ultra-high-performance system (Gmax=200mT/m) and commodity system(Gmax=45mT/m) with conventional trapezoidal waveforms (TRAP) and GrOpt waveforms. The following parameters were used: b-value=[250, 500, 750, 1000] s/mm2, RF pulse durations of T90 = 3ms, T180 = 5ms, gradient moment nulling = [M1+M2], time to TE=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50] ms, PNS threshold5 (PNSthresh)=0.8. TE differences (∆TEmin) and percent signal gain of myocardium (T2=46ms) were reported. A proof-of-concept, ECG-triggered, M1+M2 compensated, single-shot spin-echo diffusion echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (ramp-sampled6) was implemented in Pulseq with GrOpt waveforms (Table-1 and Fig-2). The phase-encoding (PE) blip gradient was turned off for the first excitation to acquire a reference to correct for odd and even PE line shifts. Two non-diffusion-weighted images were then acquired with dual polarities for linear phase correction6 followed by diffusion-weighted images. A separate two-shot EPI calibration scan was acquired right before the imaging scans. Image reconstruction included ramp sampling interpolation, ghost correction, GRAPPA reconstruction, and homodyne Partial Fourier reconstruction. Mid-systolic imaging was targeted based on the ECG signal and localizer images. Two imaging protocols were tested (Table-1). Results: In simulation, GrOpt consistently maximized hardware usage across all b-values and readouts, outperforming conventional trapezoidal (TRAP) waveforms. TE reductions over 50 ms led to estimated signal gains up to 200% (Fig-1). We integrated GrOpt into a single-shot EPI Pulseq sequence (Fig-2). Preliminary images show successful diffusion-weighting, with potential improvements in fat saturation and trigger delay selection. Conclusion: GrOpt utilizes dynamic slewing to limit PNS while reducing TE durations. Our proof-of-concept sequence development and data acquisition shows promise of optimized open-source cDTI. Future work will include sequence design improvements (integrating reference and calibration scans, improved fat saturation) and exploring simultaneous ECG-triggering and respiratory navigating to allow for free-breathing acquisitions.

(A) Comparison of GrOpt and conventional trapezoidal (TRAP) waveforms for an ultra-high-performance system with M1+M2 nulling.

N2  - Description of Clinical Presentation: A 15-year-old female with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 with a history of multiple schwannomas presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast incidentally showed a filling defect within the right atrium concerning for possible thrombus or mass. Echocardiogram showed a large, heterogeneous mass either adherent to or within the right atrium, with no internal color Doppler flow signal. Cardiac MRI was recommended for tissue characterization and to better define the tumor location and its potential impact on hemodynamics. Diagnostic Techniques and Their Most Important Findings: Using a torso phased-array coil, stacked multiplanar short axis and four-chamber long axis views of the heart were obtained using cine steady-state free precession (SSFP). Tissue characterization was performed using pre- and post-contrast T1- and T2-weighted fast turbo spin echo images, first pass perfusion imaging, and late gadolinium (10 minutes post-contrast) inversion recovery imaging. Cardiac MRI revealed a large, ovoid, well-circumscribed, septated mass measuring 4.0 x 3.9 x 3.3 cm at the roof of the right atrium, likely intra-pericardial, adherent to and compressing the right atrial wall. The mass extended from the region of the SVC entrance to the inferior aspect of the right atrium. There was no noted obstruction to systemic venous inflow. The mass was mostly isointense on T1-weighted images and was densely hyperintense on T2-weighted images. There was enhancement of the peripheral rim and the septae, both on early first pass perfusion images as well as on late gadolinium inversion recovery imaging, suggesting some degree of tumor vascularity. Differential diagnosis included a complex pericardial cyst or an intrapericardial schwannoma. Repeat cardiac MRI after 6 months demonstrated an increase in the size of the mass to a maximum diameter of 4.4 cm, and the decision was made to pursue surgical resection. During the operative course the mass was confirmed to be within the pericardial space. Resection required cardiopulmonary bypass owing to the mass’s tight adherence to the right atrial myocardium. Immunohistochemical staining of the specimen showed diffuse positivity for S-100 and SOX-10 and negativity for myogenin, consistent with an ancient schwannoma. Learning Points from this Case: Pericardial schwannomas are peripheral nerve sheath tumors thought to arise from the branches of the cardiac plexus and vagus nerve. These lesions are typically benign, but compression of adjacent structures may necessitate resection. There is scant literature documenting pediatric pericardial schwannomas. This case highlights the utility of cardiac MRI in the diagnosis, surveillance, and surgical planning of cardiac masses. Our imaging helped to confirm the location of the mass as being extra-cardiac and intra-pericardial, and tissue characterization techniques not only aided in refining the differential diagnosis, but also helped to prepare our surgeons for the need for cardiopulmonary bypass.

N2  - ABSTRACT: Degeneration of peripheral nerves causes neuropathic pain. Previous studies have documented structural and functional brain alterations in peripheral neuropathy, which may be attributed to maladaptive plasticity following chronic neuropathic pain. Nevertheless, the effects of peripheral neuropathic pain on the macroscale organization of the cerebral cortex have not been explored. This study investigated altered surface morphology and topographic hierarchy of the cerebral cortex in patients with neuropathic pain due to peripheral neuropathy. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 52 patients with peripheral neuropathic pain and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Cortical morphometric features including thickness and gyrification index were obtained using surface-based morphometry. A topographic gradient encoding interregional similarity in cortical thickness was extracted using a machine-learning technique named diffusion map embedding. Compared with controls, patients with neuropathic pain exhibited cortical thinning in the frontal and sensorimotor cortices, with the severity increasing with greater neuropathic pain. The patients also showed decreased gyrification in the insula, with a greater reduction in gyrification linked to more severe skin nerve degeneration. Moreover, the patients exhibited altered topographic organization of the cerebral cortex, where the direction of the topographic gradient deviated from the occipital-to-frontal axis observed in the controls in this study and reported in the literature. Our findings provided a novel perspective for macroscale cortical structural reorganization after neuropathic pain, showing thinning and gyral flattening in pain-related areas and deviation from the normal topographic axis of the cerebral cortex.

N2  - This study explored surface brain morphometry in type 1 diabetes including focus on painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Brain MRI was obtained from 56 individuals with diabetes (18 without DPN, 19 with painless DPN, 19 with painful DPN) and 20 healthy controls. Cortical thickness, sulcus depth, and gyrification were analysed globally and regionally in each group and in the combined diabetes group. Associations with clinical characteristics and pain were assessed. Globally, cortical thickness was reduced in the combined diabetes group and in painful DPN compared to healthy controls. No differences in sulcus depth and gyrification were found. Several regions, including the middle frontal gyrus showed reduced cortical thickness in the combined diabetes- and painful DPN group. The postcentral gyrus exhibited reduced cortical thickness in painful DPN compared to healthy controls, and reduced sulcus depth compared to painless DPN correlating with higher pain intensity. Cortical thinning manifested across the brain cortex in diabetes, especially for painful DPN. Altered postcentral gyrus morphometry may be associated with neuropathic pain. Assessing cortical morphometry may be critical for comprehending central neuropathy and the manifestation of painful DPN in diabetes.

N2  - Background/Objectives: The increasing complexity of spinal oncology procedures, particularly in en-bloc tumor resections, creates challenges in tissue perfusion assessment due to extended operative times and extensive surgical dissection. Real-time visualization of tissue perfusion can be achieved with ICG using commercially available handheld imaging systems, offering potential advantages in spinal oncology cases. This study assessed the utility of ICG in analyzing soft-tissue viability during complex spine procedures extending beyond 7.5 h, with a particular focus on oncologic resections. Methods: Three cases that required over 7.5 h of operative time were chosen for ICG utilization. These cases included an en-bloc malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor resection, an en-bloc resection of a malignant epithelioid neoplasm, and a long-segment fusion revision for pseudoarthrosis. At the conclusion of the critical portion of the procedure, a handheld intraoperative fluorescence camera was utilized to visualize the tissue penetration of intravenous ICG. Results: Prior to injecting ICG, devascularized tissue was not clearly visible. Injecting ICG allowed clear separation of vascularized (fluorescing) and devascularized (non-fluorescing) tissues. One region of non-florescent tissue was later confirmed to be devascularized with MRI and experienced postoperative infection. Conclusions: As the complexity of spinal oncology procedures increases, ICG fluorescence imaging offers a novel method for real-time assessment of tissue perfusion. This technique may be particularly valuable in extensive tumor resections, post-radiation cases, and revision surgeries where tissue viability is at risk. Further investigation in the spinal oncology population could help establish whether early identification of poorly perfused tissues impacts wound healing outcomes.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular risk management is beneficial, but stringent glycemic control does not prevent the progression of distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN). Persistent hyperglycemia-induced alterations and cardiovascular factors may contribute to diabetes-associated nerve damage. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between skin auto-fluorescence (sAF), an indicator of dermal advanced glycation end-product (AGE) accumulations, cardiovascular risk, and changes in peripheral nerve integrity. Methods: Sixty-two individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (20 women and 42 men), including 29 diagnosed with DSPN (7 women and 22 men), and 10 healthy controls (HC) underwent diffusion tensor MR imaging of the sciatic nerve to assess fractional anisotropy (FA), an indicator of nerve structural integrity. sAF measurements were combined with clinical, serological, and electrophysiological evaluations. Arterial stiffness was assessed via pulse wave velocity (PWV). Results: sAF (HC 2.1 ± 0.25 AU, nDSPN 2.3 ± 0.47, DSPN 2.6 ± 0.43; p = 0.005) was higher in individuals with DSPN compared to HC (p = 0.010) and individuals without DSPN (p = 0.035). Within the group of T2D FA correlated negatively with sAF (r = −0.49, p < 0.001), PWV (r = −0.40, p = 0.009) and high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTNT), a marker of microvascular damage (r = −0.39, p < 0.001). In DSPN, sAF correlated positively with hsTNT (r = 0.58, p = 0.005) and with PWV (r = 0.52, p = 0.007), the sciatic nerve’s FA correlated negatively with PWV (r = −0.47, p = 0.010). Conclusions: This study is the first to show close correlations between reduced peripheral nerve integrity and both intradermal AGE deposition and arterial stiffness in individuals with T2D. These findings highlight a mechanistic link between glycation-related vascular injury and neuronal damage emphasizing the importance of cardiovascular risk management in preventing DSPN.

N2  - Background and Purpose: The primary objective was to compare diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scalar parameters of peripheral nerves between subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and those without diabetes. Secondarily, we aimed to correlate DTI scalar parameters with nerve morphometric properties. Methods: Median, tibial, and sural nerves were harvested from 34 male cadavers (17 T2DM, 17 nondiabetic). Each nerve was divided into three segments. The initial segment was scanned using 9.4 Tesla MRI system (three-dimensional pulsed-gradient spin-echo sequence). DTI scalars were calculated from region-average diffusion-weighted signals. Second segment was optically cleared, acquired with optical projection tomography (OPT), and analyzed for morphometrical properties. Toluidine-stained sections were prepared from last segment, and axon- and myelin-related properties were evaluated. Results: DTI scalar parameters of median and tibial nerves were comparable between the groups, while sural nerves of T2DM exhibited on average 41% higher mean diffusivity (MD) (p = 0.03), 38% higher radial diffusivity (RD) (p = 0.03), and 27% lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (p = 0.005). Significant differences in toluidine-evaluated parameters of sural nerves were observed between the groups, with a positive correlation between FA with fiber density (p = 0.0001) and with myelin proportion (p < 0.0001) and an inverse correlation between RD and myelin proportion (p = 0.003). OPT-measured morphometric properties did not correlate with DTI scalar parameters. Conclusions: High-field DTI shows promise as an imaging technique for detecting axonal and myelin-related changes in small sural nerves ex vivo. The reduced fiber density and decreased myelin content, which can be observed in T2DM, likely contribute to observed FA reduction and increased MD/RD.

N2  - Aims: The aims were to quantify periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in adults with type 1 diabetes with different neuropathic phenotypes and to correlate WMH measurements to explanatory factors in diabetes. Methods: WMH measurements were obtained from brain magnetic resonance imaging of 56 adults with type 1 diabetes in subgroups including painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), painless DPN, without DPN and 20 healthy controls using Fazekas scale and automatic segmentation analysis. Results: No differences in Fazekas assessed WMHs were found (individuals with periventricular lesions: diabetes 66 % vs. controls 40 %, p = 0.063, deep lesions: diabetes 52 % vs. controls 50 %, p = 1.0). Using automatic detection, there were no significant differences in count of periventricular (p = 0.30) or deep (p = 0.31) WMHs. Higher periventricular lesion burden was present in diabetes compared with controls (0.21 % vs. 0.06 %, p = 0.048), which was associated with more severe DPN, increased age, decreased cognitive function, and reduced volumetric and metabolic brain measures (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings indicate increased burden of periventricular WMHs in diabetes which were associated to DPN severity and measurements reflecting neurodegeneration. Deep WMHs, often considered as chronic ischemic, were not significantly different. Mechanisms reflecting neurodegeneration and accelerated brain aging could be an overlooked aspect of peripheral and central neuropathy.

N2  - Background: Patients with diabetes demonstrate early left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Notably reduced global longitudinal strain (GLS) is related to poor outcomes, the underlying pathophysiology is however still not clearly understood. We hypothesized that pathophysiologic changes with microvascular dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis contribute to reduced strain. Methods: 211 patients with type 2 diabetes and 25 control subjects underwent comprehensive cardiovascular phenotyping by magnetic resonance imaging. Myocardial blood flow (MBF), perfusion reserve (MPR), extracellular volume (ECV), and 3D feature tracking GLS and global circumferential (GCS) and radial strain (GRS) were quantified. Results: Patients (median age 57 [IQR 50, 67] years, 70% males) had a median diabetes duration of 12 [IQR 6, 18] years. Compared to control subjects GLS, GCS, and GRS were reduced in the total diabetes cohort, and GLS was also reduced in the sub-group of patients without diabetic complications compared to control subjects (controls − 13.9 ± 2.0%, total cohort − 11.6 ± 3.0%; subgroup − 12.3 ± 2.6%, all p < 0.05). Reduced GLS, but not GCS or GRS, was associated with classic diabetes complications of albuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g) [β (95% CI) 1.09 (0.22–1.96)] and autonomic neuropathy [β (95% CI) 1.43 (0.54–2.31)] but GLS was not associated with retinopathy or peripheral neuropathy. Independently of ECV, a 10% increase in MBF at stress and MPR was associated with higher GLS [multivariable regression adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, smoking, and ECV: MBF stress (β (95% CI) − 0.2 (− 0.3 to − 0.08), MPR (β (95% CI) − 0.5 (− 0.8 to − 0.3), p < 0.001 for both]. A 10% increase in ECV was associated with a decrease in GLS in univariable [β (95% CI) 0.6 (0.2 to 1.1)] and multivariable regression, but this was abolished when adjusted for MPR [multivariable regression adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, smoking, and MPR (β (95% CI) 0.1 (− 0.3 to 0.6)]. On the receiver operating characteristics curve, GLS showed a moderate ability to discriminate a significantly lowered stress MBF (AUC 0.72) and MPR (AUC 0.73). Conclusions: Myocardial microvascular dysfunction was independent of ECV, a biomarker of myocardial fibrosis, associated with GLS. Further, 3D GLS could be a potential screening tool for myocardial microvascular dysfunction. Future directions should focus on confirming these results in longitudinal and/or interventional studies.

N2  - Background: In contrast to the brain, fibers within peripheral nerves have distinct monodirectional structure questioning the necessity of complex multidirectional gradient vector schemes for DTI. This proof-of-concept study investigated the diagnostic utility of reduced gradient vector schemes in peripheral nerve DTI. Methods: Three-Tesla magnetic resonance neurography of the tibial nerve using 20-vector DTI (DTI20) was performed in 10 healthy volunteers, 12 patients with type 2 diabetes, and 12 age-matched healthy controls. From the full DTI20 dataset, three reduced datasets including only two or three vectors along the x- and/or y- and z-axes were built to calculate major parameters. The influence of nerve angulation and intraneural connective tissue was assessed. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC) was used for analysis. Results: Simplified datasets achieved excellent diagnostic accuracy equal to DTI20 (ROC-AUC 0.847–0.868, p ≤ 0.005), but compared to DTI20, the reduced models yielded mostly lower absolute values of DTI scalars: median fractional anisotropy (FA) ≤ 0.12; apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ≤ 0.25; axial diffusivity ≤ 0.96, radial diffusivity ≤ 0.07). The precision of FA and ADC with the three-vector model was closest to DTI20. Intraneural connective tissue was negatively correlated with FA and ADC (r ≥ -0.49, p < 0.001). Small deviations of nerve angulation had little effect on FA accuracy. Conclusions: In peripheral nerves, bulk tissue DTI metrics can be approximated with only three predefined gradient vectors along the scanner’s main axes, yielding similar diagnostic accuracy as a 20-vector DTI, resulting in substantial scan time reduction. Relevance statement: DTI bulk tissue parameters of peripheral nerves can be calculated with only three predefined gradient vectors at similar diagnostic performance as a standard DTI but providing a substantial scan time reduction. Key points: • In peripheral nerves, DTI parameters can be approximated using only three gradient vectors. • The simplified model achieves a similar diagnostic performance as a standard DTI. • The simplified model allows for a significant acceleration of image acquisition. • This can help to introduce multi-b-value DTI techniques into clinical practice.

N2  - Background: Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is increasingly used as a diagnostic tool for peripheral neuropathies. Quantitative measures enhance MRN interpretation but require nerve segmentation which is time-consuming and error-prone and has not become clinical routine. In this study, we applied neural networks for the automated segmentation of peripheral nerves. Methods: A neural segmentation network was trained to segment the sciatic nerve and its proximal branches on the MRN scans of the right and left upper leg of 35 healthy individuals, resulting in 70 training examples, via 5-fold cross-validation (CV). The model performance was evaluated on an independent test set of one-sided MRN scans of 60 healthy individuals. Results: Mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) in CV was 0.892 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.888–0.897) with a mean Jaccard index (JI) of 0.806 (95% CI: 0.799–0.814) and mean Hausdorff distance (HD) of 2.146 (95% CI: 2.184–2.208). For the independent test set, DSC and JI were lower while HD was higher, with a mean DSC of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.760–0.815), mean JI of 0.672 (95% CI: 0.642–0.699), and mean HD of 2.118 (95% CI: 2.047–2.190). Conclusion: The deep learning-based segmentation model showed a good performance for the task of nerve segmentation. Future work will focus on extending training data and including individuals with peripheral neuropathies in training to enable advanced peripheral nerve disease characterization. Relevance statement: The results will serve as a baseline to build upon while developing an automated quantitative MRN feature analysis framework for application in routine reading of MRN examinations. Key Points: Quantitative measures enhance MRN interpretation, requiring complex and challenging nerve segmentation. We present a deep learning-based segmentation model with good performance. Our results may serve as a baseline for clinical automated quantitative MRN segmentation. Graphical Abstract: (Figure presented.).

N2  - Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome is the commonest upper limb peripheral neuropathy. Diffusion tensor imaging evaluates the tissue microarchitecture and measures the movement of water protons. It is non-time-consuming, not invasive and not operator dependent. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether diffusion tensor imaging can diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome and whether DTI parameters can correlate with severity of carpal tunnel syndrome. Results: Seventy-two wrists were assessed, 36 diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and 36 age and sex matched controls. FA & ADC were measured at four locations (distal radioulnar joint, proximal, middle and distal carpal tunnel), and the mean for the whole median nerve was calculated. FA & ADC showed statistically significant difference between cases and control at each of the measured four locations and the mean of the whole median nerve. FA & ADC at the hook of hamate (distal CT) showed the most significant difference between cases and control. For FA, the cut-off point at the hook of hamate was 0.5 (sensitivity 94.4%, specificity of 88.9%, positive predictive value 89.5% and negative predictive value 94.1%) and the cut-off point for the mean of the whole nerve was 0.545 (sensitivity 97.22%, specificity 77.78%, positive predictive value 81.4% and negative predictive value 96.6%). For ADC, the cut-off point at the hook of hamate was 1.44 (sensitivity 97.22%, specificity 86.11%, positive predictive value 87.5% and negative predictive value 96.9%) and the cut-off point for the mean of the whole nerve was 1.415 (sensitivity 86.11%, specificity, 83.33%, positive predictive value 83.8% and negative predictive value 85.7%). Conclusion: Diffusion tensor imaging can diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome with accuracy compared to the gold standard nerve conduction studies. Both FA and ADC showed statistically significant differences between cases & controls with FA measurements found to be more significant.

N2  - Introduction: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been increasingly utilized in the assessment of spinal cord pathologies for various clinical applications. DTI surpasses conventional MRI in delineating the microstructural integrity of the spinal cord, thereby serving as a potent, non-invasive modality sensitive to white matter pathologies. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is acknowledged to be a consequence not only of peripheral nerve and root lesions but also of central nervous system abnormalities associated with such damage. Our premise posits that the manifestation of PHN may be linked to detectable spinal cord anomalies ascertained through DTI methodologies. Material and methods: To study the spinal cord of the patients with post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) using DTI techniques, looking at the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to compare the parameters of the patients that developed PHN with the parameters of the patients that presented herpes zoster (HZ) but didn't present secondary neuralgia. Fifteen patients (two male and thirteen female) were studied. Ten patients presented PHN: nine female and one male; age from 54y to 83y (mean = 72,2). Five patients had HZ without chronic pain: four female and one male with age from 34y to 81y (mean = 60,8). Results: For ADC, we found higher values among the patients, significant differences in C5, T8, and T9 levels. For FA, we found lower values among the patients, significant differences in T7, T8, and T9 levels. On ROC curves, we identified that D8 was the single level with significant area under the curve (AUC) for discriminating patients with pain. For ADC, the AUC was 0.960 (95 %CI 0.865–1.000), p = 0.005. For FA, the AUC was 0.920 (95 %CI 0.764–1.000), p = 0.010. The cutoff value for pain on ADC was 2455.08, with a sensibility of 90 % and specificity of 100 %. For FA, the cutoff value for not having pain was 395.05, with sensibility of 100 %, and specificity of 90 %. Conclusion: This investigation highlights the potential for DTI parameters, specifically FA and ADC, to provide insight into the microstructural changes associated with PHN in patients following herpes zoster infection. Future research should continue to explore the implications of these findings in larger cohorts to further elucidate the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain in this population.

N2  - This article aims to provide an overview of the diagnostic imaging techniques currently available for the study of peripheral nerves. It focuses on reviewing the anatomy, since an adequate knowledge is essential for the correct interpretation of the images. The use of ultrasound, its indications, its use in the most common pathologies, advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is analyzed, including MRI neurography, which refers to an optimization of standard sequences to enhance the contrast of peripheral nerves and adjacent anatomical structures. Other techniques under development are also mentioned, such as elastography, which is shown to be a promising complementary technique to standard ultrasound, diffusion tensor imaging and tractography, discussing their future possibilities in the study of peripheral nerves.

N2  - Advanced imaging of peripheral nerves is occupying an increasingly important role in the diagnostic workup of peripheral nerve disorders. Advances in MR neurography (MRN) and high-resolution ultrasound have addressed historical challenges in peripheral nerve imaging related to nerves’ small size and nonlinear course and difficult differentiation from surrounding tissues. Modern MRN depicts neuromuscular anatomy with exquisite contrast resolution, and MRN has become the workhorse imaging modality for peripheral nerve evaluation. MRN protocols vary across institutions and are adjusted in individual patients, although they commonly include nerve-selective sequences and diffusion-tensor imaging tractography. Ultrasound offers a dynamic real-time high-resolution assessment of peripheral nerves and is widely accessible and less costly than MRN. Ultrasound has greater ability to examine peripheral nerves at the fascicular level and provides complementary information to MRN. However, ultrasound of peripheral nerves requires substantial skill and experience and is operator-dependent. The two modalities have distinct advantages and disadvantages, and the selection between these depends on the clinical context. This article provides an overview of advanced imaging techniques used for evaluation of peripheral nerves, with attention to MRN and high-resolution ultrasound. We draw on our institutional experience in performing both modalities to highlight technical considerations for optimizing examinations.

N2  - Background/Objectives: The accurate quantification of peripheral nerve axonal regeneration after injury is critically important. Current strategies are limited to detecting early reinnervation. DTI is an MRI modality permitting the assessment of fractional anisotropy, which increases with axonal regeneration. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate DTI as a potential predictive factor of clinical outcome after median nerve section and microsurgical repair. Methods: We included 10 patients with a complete section of the median nerve, who underwent microsurgical repair up to 7 days after injury. The follow-up period was 1 year, including the current strategy with clinical visits, the Rosén–Lundborg score and electroneuromyography. Additionally, DTI MRI of the injured wrist was planned 1, 3 and 12 months post-operatively and once for the contralateral wrist. Results: The interobserver reliability of DTI measures was almost perfect (ICC 0.802). We report an early statistically significant increase in the fractional anisotropy value after median nerve repair, especially in the region located distal to the suture. Meanwhile, Rosén–Lundborg score gradually increased between the third and sixth month, and continued to increase between the sixth and twelfth month. Conclusions: DTI outcomes three months post-operation could offer greater predictability compared to current strategies. This would enable faster decision-making regarding the need for a potential re-operation in cases of inadequate early reinnervation.

N2  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is commonly used to establish three-dimensional mapping of white-matter bundles in the supraspinal central nervous system. DTI has also been the subject of many studies on cranial and peripheral nerves. This non-invasive imaging technique enables virtual dissection of nerves in vivo and provides specific measurements of microstructural integrity. Adverse effects on the lumbosacral plexus may be traumatic, compressive, tumoral, or malformative and thus require dedicated treatment. DTI could lead to new perspectives in pudendal neuralgia diagnosis and management. We performed a systematic review of all articles or posters reporting results and protocols for lumbosacral plexus mapping using the DTI technique between January 2011 and December 2023. Twenty-nine articles published were included. Ten studies with a total of 351 participants were able to track the lumbosacral plexus in a physiological context and 19 studies with a total of 402 subjects tracked lumbosacral plexus in a pathological context. Tractography was performed on a 1.5T or 3T MRI system. DTI applied to the lumbosacral plexus and pudendal nerve is feasible but no microstructural normative value has been proposed for the pudendal nerve. The most frequently tracking parameters used in our review are: 3T MRI, b-value of 800 s/mm2, 33 directions, 3 × 3 × 3 mm3, AF threshold of 0.1, minimum fiber length of 10 mm, bending angle of 30°, and 3DT2 TSE anatomical resolution. Increased use of DTI could lead to new perspectives in the management of pudendal neuralgia due to entrapment syndrome, whether at the diagnostic, prognostic, or preoperative planning level. Prospective studies of healthy subjects and patients with the optimal acquisition parameters described above are needed to establish the accuracy of MR tractography for diagnosing pudendal neuralgia and other intrapelvic nerve entrapments.

N2  - ABSTRACT: Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) represent a complex clinical challenge, necessitating precise diagnostic approaches for optimal management. Traditional diagnostic methods often fall short in accurately assessing nerve recovery as these methods rely on the completion of nerve reinnervation, which can prolong a patient's treatment. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, has emerged as a promising tool in this context. DTI offers unique advantages including the ability to quantify nerve recovery and provide in vivo visualizations of neuronal architecture. Therefore, this review aims to examine and outline DTI techniques and its utility in detecting distal nerve regeneration in both preclinical and clinical settings for peripheral nerve injury.

N2  - OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to optimize an MRI-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol for imaging the plantar nerves at the level of the tarsus in normal equine limbs. SAMPLE 12 pelvic cadaver limbs from horses without evidence of proximal suspensory pathology were imaged with a 3T MRI system. METHODS For diffusion-weighted imaging, b values of 600, 800, and 1,000 s/mm2 were tested. Data were processed with DSI Studio. Cross-sectional areas of the medial and lateral plantar nerve along the plantar tarsus were recorded. The length and number of fiber tracts, signal-to-noise ratio, and DTI variables were recorded. RESULTS At the level of interest, the mean cross-sectional areas of the plantar nerves ranged from 5.03 to 7.42 mm2. The DTI maps consistently generated tracts in the region of the lateral and medial plantar nerves with DTI values in the range of values reported for peripheral nerves in humans. Our findings demonstrate that DTI of the medial and lateral plantar nerves can be performed successfully and used to generate quantitative parameters including fractional anisotropy and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Quantitative data generated with this imaging technique can be used to noninvasively characterize the microstructural integrity of neural tissue with possible applications in the evaluation of pathologic changes to the plantar tarsal and metatarsal nerves of horses with proximal suspensory desmopathy.

N2  - Background: Recent evidence highlights the potential of axonal degeneration as a biomarker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) detection. However, the diagnostic potential of peripheral nerve axon changes in ALS remains unclear. Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of quantitative MRI of the brachial plexus and limb-girdle muscles (LGMs) in patients with upper extremity onset of ALS. Study Type: Retrospective. Population: 47 patients with upper extremity onset of ALS and 20 healthy volunteers. Field Strength/Sequence: 3-T, three-dimensional sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions with short-tau inversion recovery sequences, T2-weighted turbo spin-echo Dixon sequence. Assessment: The cross-sectional area (CSA) and nerve-muscle T2 signal intensity ratio (nT2) of the bilateral brachial plexus as well as the CSA and fat fraction (FF) of the bilateral LGMs were assessed by two radiologists. Disease severity and clinical stage of ALS patients were assessed by two neurologists. Statistical Tests: Student's t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, binary logistic regression, interclass correlation coefficient, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and correlation analysis were performed for MRI quantitative metrics and clinical variables. Significance level: P < 0.05. Results: In the affected limbs of patients with ALS, the CSA of the brachial plexus roots, trunks, and cords and the nT2 values of the brachial plexus trunks were significantly smaller than in the healthy controls. In the LGMs, the affected limbs of ALS showed significantly smaller CSA and higher FF than controls. The model containing parameters such as brachial plexus trunk CSA, subscapularis CSA, infraspinatus CSA, and subscapularis FF had excellent diagnostic efficacy for ALS. Additionally, increased subscapularis FF and supraspinatus FF were correlated with disease severity, and subscapularis CSA was negatively correlated with the clinical stage. Data Conclusion: Brachial plexus thinning, LGM atrophy, and fatty infiltration might serve as MRI-derived biomarkers for ALS with upper extremity onset. Level of Evidence: 4. Technical Efficacy: Stage 2.

N2  - Background: Malignant soft tissue spinal canal tumors compromise 20% of all spinal neoplasms. They may be primary or metastatic lesions, originating from a diverse range of tissues within and surrounding the spinal canal. These masses can present as diverse emergencies such as secondary cauda equina syndrome, vascular compromise, or syringomyelia. Interpretation of malignant soft tissue spinal canal tumors imaging is an essential for non-radiologists in the setting of emergencies. This task is intricate due to a great radiologic pattern overlap among entities. Methods: We present a step-by-step strategy that can guide nonradiologists identify a likely malignant soft tissue lesion in the spinal canal based on imaging features, as well as a review of the radiologic features of malignant soft tissue spinal canal tumors. Results: Diagnosis of soft tissue spinal canal malignancies starts with the identification of the lesion's spinal level and its relationship to the dura and medulla. The second step consists of characterizing it as likely-malignant based on radiological signs like a larger size, ill-defined margins, central necrosis, and/or increased vascularity. The third step is to identify additional imaging features such as intratumoral hemorrhage or cyst formation that can suggest specific malignancies. The physician can then formulate a differential diagnosis. The most encountered malignant soft tissue tumors of the spinal canal are anaplastic ependymomas, anaplastic astrocytomas, metastatic tumors, lymphoma, peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and central nervous system melanomas. A review of the imaging features of every type/subtype of lesion is presented in this work. Although magnetic resonance imaging remains the modality of choice for spinal tumor assessment, other techniques such as dynamic contrast agent-enhanced perfusion magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion-weighted imaging could guide diagnosis in specific situations. Conclusions: In this review, diagnostic strategies for several spinal cord tumors were presented, including anaplastic ependymoma, metastatic spinal cord tumors, anaplastic and malignant astrocytoma, lymphoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and primary central nervous system melanoma. Although the characterization of spinal cord tumors can be challenging, comprehensive knowledge of imaging features can help overcome these challenges and ensure optimal management of spinal canal lesions.

N2  - Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft-tissue tumors prevalent in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, posing a significant risk of metastasis and recurrence. Current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging lacks decisiveness in distinguishing benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (BPNSTs) and MPNSTs, necessitating invasive biopsies. This study aims to develop a radiomics model using quantitative imaging features and machine learning to distinguish MPNSTs from BPNSTs. Clinical data and MRIs from MPNST and BPNST patients (2000–2019) were collected at a tertiary sarcoma referral center. Lesions were manually and semi-automatically segmented on MRI scans, and radiomics features were extracted using the Workflow for Optimal Radiomics Classification (WORC) algorithm, employing automated machine learning. The evaluation was conducted using a 100× random-split cross-validation. A total of 35 MPNSTs and 74 BPNSTs were included. The T1-weighted (T1w) MRI radiomics model outperformed others with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71. The incorporation of additional MRI scans did not enhance performance. Combining T1w MRI with clinical features achieved an AUC of 0.74. Experienced radiologists achieved AUCs of 0.75 and 0.66, respectively. Radiomics based on T1w MRI scans and clinical features show some ability to distinguish MPNSTs from BPNSTs, potentially aiding in the management of these tumors.
